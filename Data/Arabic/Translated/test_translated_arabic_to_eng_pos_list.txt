Wonderful. The location is excellent, close to all amenities, quiet staff, and a special thanks to the receptionist, companion for professionalism in handling and good reception.
Taste the taste of the grill and enjoy the experience. A friend said to me about his experience in tasting the food they had, which attracted me to try it. When I go to it, I had difficulty finding a position because of the zahk. He reminded me of pick-up flavors, the taste for rice is frankly all similar to the flavor of the spice is overwhelming and this means no distinctive taste the chicken is well roasted and spices maggie one of its components that are placed inside the chicken gives a new flavor to the grill chicken and is the same mixture that the West puts inside the turkey the cause of the noise and Fame is that it is by style restaurants For fast food in the demand mode and queue numbers
I finished reading it two days ago ... I remember that I could not close the book and my tears did not spill .. not because it is new .. The most painful thing about a new wound is when a writer brilliantly exudes what you keep between the corners of your memory .. that story .. These events .. The amount of life and pain all passed through me according to the names and location .. Amazing How are our stories similar to the limit .. Ghassan managed to convey that image and unlike the criticism that was directed to him the simplicity that he wore was closer to my heart I feel everything .. I was full of it .. and still .. awesome
A wonderful book for Fahmy Howeidi. A book that responds and refutes the claims of the laymen, four Egyptian writers And their allegations that the application of Sharia is not appropriate. I liked his style and his way of explaining to the reader their lies, slander and ridiculous arguments. Worth reading
good. The staff is very helpful and the cleanliness is calm suitable for families and close to restaurants and supermarkets. The internet is slow, the parking is very narrow and the pool is bad
good. Health club breakfast. There is an unpleasant smell in the bathroom
No wonder the writer of the novel committed suicide, a novel with pages of intense psychological struggle that makes you think about suicide. As soon as I read it for a few hours, I felt a severe numbness, so how was the psyche of its writer
Ideology is like water and air. O Muslim, I know and know your faith, may God have mercy on our blond Sheikh
Ahmed Al Shugairi is a person whose words are not enough for me to express the feelings of goodness, peace, mercy and goodness within me. This introduction came to classify the thought that I can talk about when I talk about something that he has supervised as a writer or regarding his thoughts .. A beautiful book differs somewhat in its content The book is divided into two parts The first section, which talks about Ahmed Al Shugairi&#39;s journey to India and the second section which In it he tells us about his journey with Gandhi, the most important and greatest of the things that he took his way to tell us about the genius Gandhi. In general, the book is very beautiful in its idea and it contains some real information, which clearly wrote utterly to solve some societal issues. I did not content myself with the first section and I wanted to extend the trip to get to know India more, which will motivate me to visit India.
good. New, very clean, good location for the campus. Very bad service until I transport the bags. I did it myself, even the number of beds in the rooms. For the third time, I imagine I am a mahram, sending a cleaner to the room, and we find a family. Finally, after a complete roll on the fourth floor, there is no TV. Workers say the dish is not installed. There is no villa.
Great hotel and respectful of customers. Everything I liked about the hotel is the staff is very friendly, respectful and respectful of the guest. The mattress is very rough, the pillows didn&#39;t work for me ... it might suit someone else
Dubai&#39;s finest hotels. Everything I liked: The location of the hotel overlooks the sea and is wonderful..General services and room services are fast..Planning the hotel community more than beautiful..Respection personnel were a summit in magnificence, especially Professor Ahmed..Egyptian nationality .. I advise everyone to deal with them I spent the most beautiful days In this hotel as most of my photos in Dubai are pictures of antiques, swimming pools and restaurants of the hotel .... nothing
Excellent . Yeah. No
A mixture of history, sociology and psychology with an ironic style and objective methodology
Excellent . Everything is perfect. The price is expensive two pills
A really interesting book ... Ben Nabi, the teacher, accompanies you in the details of his life
I ruined this novel, oh God, hahahahahahahaha. Firstly, the novel is more than wonderful. Its idea is very powerful and real. It will be a reason, so many people change, and I am the first of them .. It really changed many needs. This is from me. I read it and felt the sweetness of faith and closeness to our Lord. And what we have all our sins and sure of our Lord will reward you with all the good that will change because of you will be that God willing, in your company in paradise ... but I wanted to say, I also need something, at the beginning, I wanted to complete the novel for the other because I liked it, but the way the story was narrated was not interesting enough enough, I was thinking of complementary because of this, but thank God I completed it for the end because its end is a masterpiece Hard and has a strong message, I may not be able to hold myself It is laughter about the unexpected end, but it is a real bigger greeting to you, you are a talented writer, and good luck, God willing, in the upcoming works.
Thanks to the staff and for the reception. The location and services of the smiling staff. There is no
good. . Wi-Fi is not free, while in less apartments it is free
Exceptional. A new hotel and another new area in Dubai It seems that this hotel will be among the prestigious hotels in Dubai as it chooses the staff carefully.
The novel is excellent, and its style is completely new to it, from the most beautiful novels. Elly, her village after Azazel. A short sentence, but it is expressive and extremely beautiful. I still remember some of her sentences. Eazinb, and I keep writing to you, you start imposing your presence. On a faded entity, he continues to do me a drink, giving him a chance to show off. Love is the state of Alana&#39;s identification with the other. Yazinab never absent and present in the conscience. I am the one here I am not who I was. Sadness, human beings varied from resident and from transit. Optimism is a great risk for my likes. Her face took her astonishment. It is hard for one to live without losing his reasons for being alive. Unaware, I am the extent of irresponsibility, or foolish, the extent of stupidity
A wonderful...
With confidence, the best novel published in so far.
Wonderful. everything. Booked a smoker room and not available
Razavi Ashour completed the journey of creativity .. This is something that is full of words .. I loved very dearly and lived with her every moment. . There is only one mistake. At night, there is no description of Razavi originally. May God have mercy on you, Razavi
I have another experience. Excellent cleanliness. The services are far
Excellent. Nice.
Excellent . everything. No free Wi-Fi in the rooms
My dream was that the worry would go away from me. At your door. It was my dream to see my grave. On your doorstep. I hinted as a technician and it was a wave. More merciful than your torment And I spared my homeland, a grave containing me in your soil. So I was confused with housing. And now hold back the shroud. What happened to you, my country? . I screamed and the words run from my mouth: these are countries ... they are not my country anymore
A beautiful book, I love the simplicity of Ahmed El-Aidy, who is strong and has more than one masterpiece poem, such as: Thanks God. Jerk off to innocent desire. To check me. Orphan Paragraph. Small cut. The last one loves you. Why do I like it so much? Of course it is not possible for this masterpiece. I don&#39;t know when I stayed like this. Not possible. He does not love girls. Other than those who love pain. My chest is open to air. But I ... locked. What are you doing doctor? In what blindness hope. Even what I understood via it. Complementary. A railway that can be reposted. Do not forget. I have to run the tears. With cheap laughter. And always shy ... I don&#39;t know when I stayed like this. Not possible. I missed you, I found myself pocketing your name and pressing.
Most people judge books based on the cover, which is common. As for others like me, I judge him from the beginning of his pages; the writing style is what makes me keep reading .. In this novel specifically, I read the first of its pages and felt like a continuation of another book, as the writer started to tell the story as if the reader knows what he is talking about .. I stopped reading I put the book aside, I was very surprised when I got this high evaluation? It is true that people&#39;s tastes differ, but everyone who asks and reads from him finds him praising him and saying, continue reading, they are wonderful. I didn&#39;t give them any attention, and I read several other books, but destiny wanted me to think about it, and I found a colleague of mine who encouraged me to read it with me .. I started and deepened, and I signed this book from those books that you find yourself thinking about and wondering about, I felt that I was actually with them , I felt the sadness that they feel, with joy, of resentment, and even of the taste of the pies they eat .. I lived with them their joy and their sorrow, and what more sadness. The novel begins with the grandfather and ends with the grandson of the granddaughter. You can imagine how many of the situations I lived with them ... I created Radwa Ashour in them, and I will definitely read everything I wrote, God willing.
We speak when the gates of peace are closed to us before our thoughts, and when we are unable to reach the state of stillness in the unity of our hearts, we turn to seize our lips, because the sound distracts us and entertains us, and in many of our words our thoughts almost explode from pain and gloom, because thought is a bird from space birds, which can simplify His wings are in the cage of words, but he cannot fly.
Wonderful. The location is excellent, and the breakfast buffet is great. The internet was weak
New frontiers of historical information river
A beautiful novel, much more beautiful than the series ... The beginnings of Ahmed Murad
The comment of my older brother, Dr. Mohamed Ibrahim, on the book. : //. . / / .... A very important book, and I recommend reading it strongly. Especially for those who count themselves among the youth of the Islamic trend.
W Barcelona offers residential services I stayed at the W Barcelona from day to day, in a great room. I arrived early and registered my name at the hotel. The registration process is always busy, and there is a big and happy surprise but with mixed feelings. Sometimes your early arrival leads you to a room that no one else wants. My share of room number, was on the fifth floor. The beach was opposite my room, but a third of the view was obstructing me due to the other prominent rooms at the front. This only affects the first floors, so be careful, as each room ends with a number that has the same problem. These rooms are also adjacent to the storage and laundry rooms, among others. I loved the design of the room, the shared desk with the bed is very soft, what a really good bed spoil me, as well as the spacious space. The shower space can accommodate five people, not joking, so let’s consider, for example, that you took your boyfriend to have sex for the first time. You will inevitably discover the peculiarities of their bathroom laughing out loud. I did not consume anything from the room fridge, as there is a big store and restaurants at the beginning of the beach, and this is a pleasant walk away. Prices for the pool area and services are very moderate. On Sunday, on the top floor, you do not stop by the pool, the staff working in this area did not check the area even once, so I did not receive any services. Another day, I learned that the top floor was open, and I went up. I learned that it was closed when I asked for a service. Then I learned that it is not closed, but there is no service. I was just meters away from the main bar. The position of the workers in this area is as if they say, I know, man, that we are very calm. We do a favor for you here. However, I left the area and did not return to it for the duration of my stay. Hint I use the signs; I can&#39;t read minds, but if the staff is so lazy that they can&#39;t do the services upstairs, there&#39;s something wrong. At the nightclub, I was disappointed again because of the lack of communication, and the lack of signs or information about the region&#39;s protocols. I saw every two sitting on your sofas, so I had to leave completely. If there were signs, there would be no embarrassment for the people. After eleven o&#39;clock in the evening this region becomes private and the cost of staying in euros is where the excellent service provided by the workers once the place is opened. It seems that those who provide alcoholic beverages are good, but when they are busy like this then there will be speed, yet my drink was moderate. Wave Restaurant I had a very good meal, and a great attentive service made me happy. Managers always work hard, but sometimes regret can be an easy backup. Guest services What about the low seating for guests? Sitting in this drop feels as if the seat is the one sitting on you, the opposite must be done, according to the known power arrangement. And we ended up changing rooms, on the number floor, room number, which is the same type of room as it overlooks a port, after I mentioned that the wonderful rooms are supposed to have nothing to obscure seeing from them. Note that the warm rooms are located on floors from to; these rooms seem to be great except for rooms from to; all overlook the ocean and the harbor. As for all the large rooms and others overlooking the beach and the city Location I did not find the location far from the old neighborhoods, so you can walk on foot, or take the bus number / which stops on the main road near the hotel entrance, and the price of the bus ticket. Euros, and the taxi may cost you approximately Euros. In general, I would probably come here again, as the location fits in with me, as is the layout of the room, the bathroom was excellent and the two rooms were reasonably quiet. It was a shame there was the low pool service as well as what is known as nerve cooling. As the title shows, this place caters to a specific demographic as it focuses on it well, but I am not a fashion fan, but all I want is comfort and kindness. It is a service.
Weird this creative ability that transports you between the lives of five people in a period of one year in several times the country goes through on page
Ahmed Abdul Majeed. For the second time, it brings psychological peace to his followers
An important book I recommend reading it. But I think the name does not apply to the topic .... The book in general analyzes the Islamic-Islamic dispute from the point of view of sociology ... It is a new reading ... I very much enjoyed it ... His analysis of the temptation during the era of Uthman ... and Ali’s disorder and Muawiyah and the dispute Shi’ite Sunni, to say the least, is wonderful. His analysis of the revolutions and how success is the grave of the revolution .. And that a small organized group can defeat a large, dispersed group ..... And I conclude with a quote from the book ... The truth without strength supports it, there is no good in it
Excellent. The location is very excellent, the price is reasonable and it has breakfast and internet. The internet is bad
My heart hurts ..... This novel exhausted me. Feeling of complete helplessness, I felt after a word in its last pages. How do I describe all this painful sadness .. How do I revive my words after she died with her people one by one. If death is the title of the novel..the language has a life..the language is rich and rich and empowered..what attracts you to its world, praising in its vastness, enjoying it with the limit of joy and the limit of love and pain. Ayman Al-Atoum .. my full respect and appreciation..and you are creative
The hotel deserves ... Roqan .... Location ... good handling ... cleanliness ... close to Mall of the Emirates ...
Fine is me
A simple and brief explanation of many religions. My favorite writer, Anis Mansour .... and I will sail in Anis&#39; world
I was one of the lucky ones to see a draft of that novel. So my testimony will be hurt. Regardless of my witness to the labor period, the author is one of the closest to my heart on a personal level. So I will try to summarize. Adoration is the next novel for a peace hymn. If you like the hymn, you will love. Abdul Majeed has developed a lot of his style of narration and has started to move from event to smooth event. In love, he entered into the convolutions of the soul more, so he made clear the difference between the human qualities that are made from a person who does not rise to the quality of angels and does not descend to the qualities of demons. In love you will understand more about the Igo .. The Igo that prevents us from rising and without Ego will give us wings to fly in the sky. He also dealt with traffickers, the greatest of souls, and most of them. I liked his new narration. Connecting the past to the present. Ahmed has been united by his hero, so he writes this time with his spirit. I will not speak more and I will let you read it voraciously. Buy it, it deserves
I know for sure that I have never treated a human being as petty or despicable, except that it is a punishment for him on bad manners. The telly of the Akkad character.
Simply .. Diwan is the most beautiful Ami Diwan I have read in my life. From the first gift to the last poem .. I have no need but I like it. The Valley is an artifact written, philosopher, and actually worn:
A wonderful report explaining the extent of the military penetration and their influence on the rule in Egypt. His conclusion is remarkable that the second republic will not be established until after the state of officers is completely disintegrated from the Egyptian state. I wish it was a berth reading:
Worth a visit. The availability of beds, cleanliness, and a complete and sufficient kitchen in the lobby. Spacious rooms, lounge, washbasin, stove, microwave and fridge. The mother of a room and a hall itself has two rooms and a hall, but the room will share a sitting session and in the back four beds and one bathroom, may God honor you.
Some people may think that it is easy to add a new part to a series of novels that have its world, characters and events .... But to find this addition with such mastery and interdependence, you are facing a phenomenon that must stop before it ... Hussam Nader .. This name that you must Everyone remembers it well, after a few years it will be of great importance in the world of fantasy ... good luck
Excellent taste and excellent price in Mecca and Medina. Everything is beautiful and affordable and they do not eat. Everything is available. The bake is one of the most famous restaurants in the city. Eating is distinctive taste and excellent price.
Exceptional. The place is suitable.
The important thing is that words start, that people live in the minds and minds of people. He was not able to tyrant over the eras of history to imprison words because they, like spirits, roam the horizons ... Do not be deleted, tortured, or buried in the dust .. Her life is eternal:. It remains a spin and a role .... Blessed are the strangers ... Blessed are the martyrs ... May God have mercy on you, successor to him, Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace
Excellent hotel and perfect place to stay. Quiet location cleanliness. Delay bringing the car when exiting
Excellent location the Moroccan receptionist was nice to us. Cleanliness and location.
Location, comfort and close to everything. I recommend living in it. everything is OK
The writer has a literary style and great depictions that are beyond description of her beauty .. If you search for the beauty of the rhetorical and literary style, you will find a lot .. But the content of most stories did not interest me because most of them are repetitive, but the writer&#39;s thinking is very sophisticated and sublime .. In general the writer is a method that makes the heart fail for its beauty. The stories ..
nice place . Comfort and world-class hotel. There are no channels
The style is great, the end is no better than that. You feel that the book guides you in the direction of yourself, to the extent that you feel in every situation that you put yourself in the place of heroes and start a dialogue with yourself, what will be the reaction. With the beauty of the politics and political positions in the novel in a way that does not affect the documents, it is worthy of
The first novel that I read while I was about twelve years old ... If I could imitate this writing as a decoration or something more valuable, I would have done .... a novel that I would not put aside before I would have cried with the heroes and raised your laughter with them ... and depressed their affliction ... ... you only wish me the heroes ...
Rest and rest. Everything was at the desired level. Everyone is better
Wonderful. I liked in the hotel the screen of the reception staff and their keenness on the comfort of the guest, especially mentioning the alternate director Mohammed Al-Wasli, who made a great effort in providing the appropriate room, which guarantees us a comfortable stay. I did not like having to change the room more than once due to lack of hygiene and other reasons, but the responsible employee made a thankful effort to solve this problem
I enjoyed it very much. I liked the drawing of the people and the flow of the unfamiliar narration, and if some parts of it were prolonged and others were repeated
A hearty meal of feelings ... a wonderful and very deep novel ... and the musical analogues are beyond description
Excellent. . The internet is very slow
Beautiful . By God, it is one of the best motels I have ever stayed in Dubai. There is no
Written by French writer Bernardine Saint-Pierre. And translated by Mustafa Lutfi Al-Manfalouti. Al-Manfalouti added, with his pen, a stream of creative descriptions and linguistic wealth ... a beautiful novel from the classics of literature.
Wonderful of the most wonderful novels I have read ... masterpiece
I really liked the novel, with deep talk and hours of sweet talk, but in general the idea of the book is sweet with a touch of terror.
Excellent among the hotels that I recently stayed in. It is from the Hilton family and among the hotels that respect the permanent members of the Hilton. This hotel overlooks the Nile Corniche and its location is excellent. The hotel is amazing in terms of living and living in it and the large rooms. I need a system and cleanliness, and those working in it meet you with welcome, affection, and a healthier love for those who have not visited this hotel to visit immediately and do not regret
When you finish reading this book, you know that those around you are not stupid:
Delicious and entertaining
Ahmed Murad loves the imagination of detective stories, a novel with a near-realistic nature, and the narration of content is great. Many of the events narrated by the narrator are wonderful, reflecting societal, authoritarian, and sometimes sexual futility in his thinking, which is based on reality ... I recommend the novel.
Good one. The place is very good, close to Mall of the Emirates, restaurants and metro, and the cleanliness is excellent. They take a deposit of one dirham and return them when leaving the hotel
Certainly a useful book, although I am not enthusiastic about describing the actions of the Prophet as being caused by genius but rather something greater than this, it is the revelation of God and his success, by placing the word genius that is placed upon him be peace and blessings with the rest of the geniuses and thinkers ... With that book is interesting and useful
One of the most interesting novels that I liked, attracted, and thought called for reflection. Although most of its events are expected, but the end is strange. Words that do not fit in a book and an intellectual novel are not sexual and market suggestions that will convey the reality in its entirety with my respect to the writer:
good. Comfort and cleanliness. nothing
We had a lot of fun I visited in a month / and I will visit again this month / It is a first-class family place I do not advise young people to visit where calm and tranquility The rooms are wonderful and clean The pool is small but tasty and you play with your children As for food, the dinner meal is excellent and breakfast is also friendly The hospitality team has met My request for a cot without any additional cost. As for the faults, it is the beach. There is no living room for the residents, in addition to the chalets and rooms that are located in a high place that may be a little tired for the elderly.
Beautiful and comfortable hotel. The location, services and staff are trying to listen to you and help you. Nothing short
good. Breakfast was heil.
Very cheap suitable for the modest secret and for the big family. The price is attractive. Its location is far from the center of Dubai and Jumeirah and in the area of Indian workers
South Ambassador. Great hotel, I would advise them to be comfortable, relaxed and beautifully treated.
I read it fun .. I didn&#39;t want to get rid
I did not know that weddings are safe, weddings are safe, and who is safe in Palestine? Their weddings are far, far away ... I read it during the Gaza war, I felt that I was in the streets, and had it not been for the truce there yesterday, I would have cried on paper.
Excellent. The ruins of Khalifa Tower. You enter the hotel an hour and sit down looking at the lobby, the text of the hour, which led to the exit rooms
A race for good and evil, and as usual, good triumphs, but evil does not end. This end is preferable. The narration was one of the best things I read to the extent that I was crying for what happened to her and Emad and sadness of Walid .. Friends are more than a need for her love in all narrations .. waiting for the new from Essam Youssef and remaining in same level
Antidepressant
Wonderful book, I like the writer and his adherence to his views.
Very beautiful . Tranquility and decoration and workers in order to magnificence. There is no
the movie
The best relaxation and the best organization. A very beautiful hotel worth visiting and also an excellent location near the train station and all restaurants are available.
The Rubaiyat of Khayyam is a philosophical poem with distinction in which faith is mixed with skepticism, pessimism with optimism, confusion with certainty, existence with nothing. Omar Khayyam invites them to enjoy life with all its pleasures, and what wine he praises in this work is only a symbol of this material life. Khayyam believes that our earthly life is much better than our eschatological life, adopting the nihilistic view of life, this life that has no meaning in all its tragedies and the misery of people in it and also what our emergency presence is in .. In this poem also there is an internal struggle between the life of the faithful tents who He wants to repent of his sins and the age of Khayyam, who doubts and revolts on religious concepts of fate, resurrection, and lastlife .. Indeed, there is still a discussion about the ratio of these Khmer squads to Omar Khayyam who was known for his morals and knowledge, but this does not prevent classification These quartets as a philosophical work explores the depths of the human psyche in their crises of existence Of this world Alamvhom and ruthless.
This is a charade, as Dr. Mustafa Mahmoud said, it is inspired by what Sheikh al-Akbar Muhyiddin bin Arabi wrote about the opposite, meaning the conflict of contradictions within the human soul, when the soul wants something and wishes its opposite. And the text revolves, as the doctor points out about the apparent name, and he is the ruler and predominant of the people of the earth. Then the inner name, which is the ruler and predominant among the people of the subcontractor, who loves isolation, being alone, meditating and worshiping .. The conflict actually revolves between two personalities that represent controversy and conflict between the people of al-Zahir and the people of the subcontinent, or the worldly soul searching for pleasures and satisfying instincts. , And the blame soul searching for serenity and salvation .. The events of the representation that have been invalidated by a Sufi woman and her hero are represented by a man representing a outward personality, then a dialogue takes place between them, after which he ends up asking her to follow her, so she tells him that he will not be able to patience with her, and the taking continues The response to the speech in the context of an accelerated fiasco represents an opposing viewpoint ... just as it is Thelaya includes lyrical lyric connections, through which the heroine recites poetic passages from Ibn Arabi&#39;s poetry in a way that is appropriate to the context of the latest .. The hero’s ideas soon begin to collapse and the woman answers, saying: You trained my brain and thwarted my mind .. from you to God .. from you Allah. Then the events go on to talk about the injustice and negativity of the nation, the book includes a summary for this is: Muslims smoke hookahs in cafes and wait for God to be loved for them. And it is a shame .. and a fallacy even in the matter of their religion. After that, the book moves on to talk about the fundamentalist groups that have distorted the image of Islam by taking the path of violence. The doctor says: The Islamic groups have started from completely wrong beginnings and are still insisting on them .. which is an attempt to jump on power and usurp the rule .. And I thought that jihad begins From jihad with the other and conflict with the other .. I forgot that the jihad actually begins from the jihad with the soul and the struggle with the enemy that lies within the soul .. Satan, selfishness, fanaticism, the devil of intolerance, archeology, and madness of empty leadership .. I forgot that Islam started with thirteen A year of psychological education in the school of prophethood, where the great companions were trained in c Ed older with self .. in the separation of Walker snakes Amplifies Dr talking about Israel and what the Zionists are doing from the crime and killing and seek arms from one side in the face of the world of Islam, and the extent of their threat to Slmm. He also states that Zionism is doing what he called terrorism that is funded by abroad with millions of dollars, imported bombs and imported missiles. With their Torah.
All details are close to reality
Good project, God bless you. Hygiene site price. nothing
Kuwaiti in Dubai. Location and rest. The lack of cleaning of rooms and services, and the absence of Clinics and Shampoo
Why did they hammer the walls? . .... In my opinion, death for the goal is better than the death of the target itself. ... amazing despite all the pain
I really enjoyed my stay at the Muhammadiyah Palace. . The breakfast was beautiful and varied .... the bed was comfortable ... the smell of the bedspreads and pillows was nice and fine ... and the apartment was clean and spacious .... and the service was prompt by the staff .. the sprinkler is rather narrow .. Room cleaning service does not focus on vacuuming carpets when ordering to clean the apartment ... but overall their cleaning was good.
fantastic place . Fast and efficient car service.
Of books that talk about beauty. Beauty If inside you you will see everything around you is very beautiful. It has a spontaneous spirit that refreshes you and gives you a terrible joy. The most liked chapters ordinary person. A terrible dose of enthusiasm. Do not miss this book from your hand:
A wonderful and elegant work that adds to the balance of Al-Aswany .. What I liked most about the novel is drawing characters, penetrating their dimensions, controlling and mastering their keys .. As well as the elegant and elegant literary style and smooth language, Aswani possesses in his literary style the so-called easy refrain
Very very useful in knowing many of the differences between the nature of men and women ... useful for all who are about to marry and all married couples too .... useful in general even: I recommend reading it
Excellent. Breakfast buffet and excellent staff treatment ..
Wonderful in the full sense of the word; God, it is a word that does not fulfill its right. As long as you are our creative writer, we love you and we will love you until we die.
Excellent. . There was no Greer authority in Haha
I advise all of you to read itaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
A unique and unique book in which he listed differently from our master Muhammad, peace be upon him .. I recommend reading it:
A beautiful novel that loved me reading because my beginnings of reading were with her. Literary dream style is wonderful
Gorgeous . Spacious hygiene. Inspection upon entry denotes reception and lack of smile
The second part of rare cases was full of exciting and strange stories during which the writer fought terrifying adventures, but they must have been interesting. In this part, I lived with every teenage girl .. but my wonder was bigger .. Because I really realized that the women’s plot is often great. These accounts showed me many facts that I cannot believe in my life because of the nature of the kind woman who is looking for tenderness only. The story of our neighbor&#39;s girl who bury cats amazed me with her amazing ability to mask a story of fiction and even her ability to do such a pernicious work that is the heart of a human being. And the story of where my husband&#39;s wealth is is no less than her predecessor, so how can this kind, loyal woman to her husband dare to do such a thing, but how can this sister of her wife take revenge and plan a crime that is such a real ugliness the world ugly brutally his strange secrets ... As for the flat girl number has loved her a lot .. Her innocence and personality that really attracted me, even though her story did not carry a lot of weirdness. Someone visited us at night and astral projection interfered with the symptoms of Stendhal .. I liked it very much. I was very interested in the issue of hysterical fleeing ... As for a complicated issue, all of its events were stupid. I used to laugh a lot at the strange behavior of the writer .. Nothing provoked my interest except the operation that that doctor performed .. Replacing the mind cells is truly amazing. . This part was more beautiful than its predecessor: ..
They live in a nightmare in which they feel creative. When they wake up from that dream, I will have preceded them with life. That&#39;s how fun is. Influence: real ;. Very worth reading
A beautiful dialogue between a new contemporary couple and in a social atmosphere and authentic Egyptian traditions ... I liked the conversation that is very important to me and what is most beautiful is that it is colloquial
The language is good and the narration is tight in the majority of all parts, but there is a bit of boredom and much more detail. If they were removed, the topic would be preserved completely ... The news margins are great ... I could like more than I liked because the novel ... has a very negative personality and exists from it, so society has a lot , Abdul Majeed and all the characters that I met in the novel are passive and almost no positive personality other than a single mother who served a thief to answer the electrical appliances ... :. The totality is complete ..
Really great hotel, it was an enjoyable vacation. The place is really amazing. Everything is really beautiful. The swimming pools, the restaurant, bars and service are excellent. Everyone who really takes care of how happy and fulfills the requests of those who eat is very beautiful except for the Asian dinner. I need an increase in its items, but in general the whole food is good and the manager of the restaurant a / Hani is a person in the highest respect and humility and service and reception very respectable people like a / Peter for example, but not limited to myself, God willing, I will return again ... but it is necessary to see a solution to the law Because the place is so beautiful, free A simple problem uniform de people get upset .. and I wish the beer is added to the comprehensive system of Egyptians because it is not considered alcohol .. and advise what extent he actually visiting the Sierra because he never Hendm Mesh ...
Go everywhere. The location of the hotel is average to reach all places in Bur Dubai or Deira or even Sharjah and other cities and old and new deaths from several different ways. There is a market and massage places around the hotel and the Oud Metha area has many different restaurants for different tastes and prices are reasonable As well as other services such as laundries, but beauty places for women and others .... The bed is low, which leads to lack of attention when passing by, and the effects of hitting the leg and leg frequently. . The quality of the bed sponge is not enough because we wake up and feel that our bodies are broken. . The restaurant is small and accommodates the number of customers if the hotel is full.
Gorgeous . Reception officials are Egyptian nationals, their treatment and cooperation is wonderful. Price change from reservation due to taxes, new buildings, blocking shadows on Khors, high price of apartments
The two books provide the most important insights for those interested in change. The first part was more literary and enjoyable than the second part, which was marred by many lengthy dialogues that resemble articles. In my opinion, the prominent weakness of the two works was dialogue, sometimes you find it colloquial and sometimes you find it fluent without logical control. I don’t mind mixing colloquial with classical if it finds a strong justification for that .. Perhaps the second part of his style in which he wrote was tended because of the urgent need for the writer to develop the idea of the two books more. I was astonished by the technical details and the details of business administration and development work .. In the end I was very impressed with the two works despite the drawbacks that I had on him .. Despite my feeling of some kind of boredom in the middle of the second part .. A very important work especially that it was written in the pre-revolutionary period and has many predictions and lessons Unfortunately, we did not benefit from the revolution, such as mixing abstract development work with politics, its adaptations and endless adventures. And like the need to pave the society and raise its human quality in order to better receive change and contribute to it effectively.
A wonderful novel in every sense of the word. ..And once again Ahmad Murad takes a breath in a wonderful literary work ... For me, the novel touched my soul and flew to me for that time and place
good. . No parking available
Excellent trip. I liked everything. And reception is at the height of ethics. nothing
The best experience. The crew treated them fine, the view of the Burj Khalifa is magnificent, their restaurants are beautiful ... and the best thing is that you are looking at the Mohammed bin Rashid Boulevard. nothing
This deep, valuable novel takes the pulp, and I don’t know now if I really understood it… or is about to understand it .. It carries a lot of mixed feelings between it .. It is a journey in the true self and all that passes through it is nothing but metaphors for what is inside your mind, yourself and your life .. And again you confirm that what really happens in your life is a reflection and a result of what is inside you .. In order to reach what you want you must open your eyes well and see the truth ... very amazing
The book, God willing, is great. What is the language, strong and sophisticated..I enjoyed it very much. And bless you ..
What makes someone special in his field is not just talent, but talent when it reaches the limit of madness ... I have always wondered ... Who is where Saramago comes with those imaginary societies? How can he weave a story where everything is so mixed up? In his writings, Saramago always creates a state of collective awareness that moves society as a single block towards something, or towards a strange event ... In death interruptions, the writer imagines ... what if death feels bored one day, and then decides to stop? What will happen ? What is the impact of that on the people of this community? He wonders in blindness .. What if everyone becomes blind? What could happen in a community of blind people? How do people deal with this phenomenon? He wonders here in Insight .. What if the people decide to challenge the government and not elect anyone? How does the government act on this? What will be the people&#39;s reaction to what the government did? Questions you may see as silly and silly, but Saramago grasps them wisely and weaves them into a solid and beautiful garment ... The answers to these questions, and the truth is said, illogical, and you may feel that they are unnatural .. But who said that Saramago is natural or logical? Didn&#39;t we just say that creativity that is not characterized by insanity is not creativity? Another thing that distinguishes Saramago is that he talks about the novel in a reader-style, not narrator, and you find him sometimes wondering what will happen in the novel after a while and update himself sometimes with thoughts on his mind ... What really exhausted me is the narration style .. long breathless phrases .. many, many lots of sentences The objection that requires a present mind to pass it ... I saw this before in the death interruptions and I thought it was a translation error, but I found it here too ... You can pass all this and enjoy it with a little patience, but if you are not patient, then I advise you to try. .
I love it simple and light and simulates the mind. Enthusiastic complete the reading of the same topics.
Nice collection of short stories. I love this kind of literature that presents an important idea without boredom and in a number of no more than two or three pages. The most powerful stories that I liked are: the strong man, tomorrow is also coming, the only man and finally the layers of happiness in which he presented a point of view The police are in the best way to deal with outlaws
Al Raha Beach is a named name. Everything is the location of the hotel, fine dining and very delicious Arabic breakfast, one of the most beautiful hotels in Abu Dhabi. nothing
I no longer doubt that God, whom we knew in Palestine, also came out of it, and that he is a refugee in a place where I do not know, unable to solve the problems of himself. Ghassan Kanafani, the land of sad orange. Only now I know why they assassinated me. An anecdotal group shed tears while reading it. Kanafani with all the genius managed to embody Palestine and the Palestinians in a short anecdotal set. Adeeb did not and will not come to describe the issue and the personality of the Palestinian in this depth. Do not die before it was Nada .. Do not die. Ghassan Kanafani, the land of sad orange. Only now I know why they assassinated me. Only now I know why they assassinated me
Light and quick to read .. I may return to take some ideas from him ..
Attractive to read ... by pulling and page on the base of the unit
Fine hotel. A classy, clean hotel and good staff treatment. nothing
Exceptional. Close to the Prophet’s Mosque .. the price was good riyals .. services .. sophisticated dealing with the hotel crew. Wi-Fi is weak.
What a huge amount of sadness, well-being ... painful and tired, this book felt I was reading tears, not letters. But I liked it .. I really liked my grief
The device is for a great price ... fast, imminent, and its screen is excellent, but the camera is somewhat slow and lacks its accessories.
very good . The location of the hotel is distinctive because it is close to the Haram. The reception was very good and the housing procedures are fast. The settlement time is four o&#39;clock.
fantastic place . Close to campus, clean place, staff, breakfast. Some guests annoyed late at night
The summary of the truth in the Arab situation
Clean and quiet. Cleanliness and tranquility, the pool is large and clean. Housekeeping workers are weak in meeting demand
Lafecraft is really terrifying ... it was probably only a psychopath that could produce such thoughts and represent them in words and phrases.
I took the advice of the writer in the introduction and did not take a position on the book, either by rejecting it or by accepting it, but the book explains the wonderful education of the Muslim Brotherhood University as it shows the negatives of the group, but all this does not concern me and does not benefit me except the part of the Islamic term and that is from page to
Exceptional. Its proximity to the chapel and its views.
Laughter, which with time, turns distressed and crying because all that is decreed is true. My first experience with artist Bahjat Uthman and I didn’t know, and it was coincidentally pure, which made me know the book. It was a nomination by Godrez, but this coincidence is worthy of celebration. The book attracted me and the drawings are very expressive, but because of my ignorance of the painter and that he passed away, I mean, to attend a revolution and nothing else. And with my growing feeling as I browsed through the book that he was painting yesterday, the shock came when you knew that it was spreading in meaning from more than one year. And you know that we are leaving like a reel like a costume after it, neither we advance nor delay later on the same ignorance and stupidity and backwardness or if in change it will remain a descent to the abyss. M the other is our condition Manial
Very cool dress-up. I wrote a simple and quick review of my blog. : //. . / =
Exceptional. Everything is special, and the most beautiful thing is that there is a men&#39;s club and a women&#39;s club.
Nice stay. The location is excellent, the staff are helpful, but there is a Filipino employee, her manners are tight, and the hotel is very clean, allowing friends to enter. For those who can not speak English it is not good because I did not see any Arab person among the hotel’s troubles in the morning when cleaning the neighboring rooms. The internet price is overrated.
Wonderful atmosphere, wonderful team work, calm and quiet smile in every place in the corridors of the hotel when you talk to them as they were your friends, especially in the reception and ease and speed of the Jiknick out the rooms are wonderful and very quiet and the air conditioning system is unique and the family is very comfortable Breakfast in the morning in a very calm atmosphere especially I hope to go back and book in this The hotel over and over again has a very privileged location close to the High Street metro as Misfington as well as grocery stores
Budget hotel. The presence of the bus during prayer is an economic hotel and is a few minutes drive to the Haram. Furniture is below average, no internet
I am okay. I miss all eyes. Nobody said .. I would love you. Creates a beautiful situation
Exceptional. Close to the campus, neat and clean. Everything I liked. There is an unpleasant smell on reception
Boudl distinct hotel comfort. I liked everything.
Exceptional. customers service. Close the pool early, until late or late evening
more than great . The staff is excellent and understanding. The breakfast is varied and great.
Very beautiful . The sweet is that it is very close to the super market and it is open an hour and provides taxis in addition to cleanliness and the services are great, but I make sure that it is golden sands because golden sand for singles and if it is a person or two but gold sands for families or a group of people .. the internet is very very weak
good. Yeah. The service in the restaurant is of a low standard
To rest an address. everything. nothing
Enjoy what you read, what is the need for Omar Taher, but if you did not wait for Zamalek
Appropriate . The staff are helpful, the hotel is clean, tidy, quiet, safe and very suitable for families. Sometimes you hear the inconvenience of cars from the street and crowding under the street, but the price is a little high at night
I have two novels and two novels that I have read so that you may be raised, and excuse me for memorizing the title, for I respect you as a writer more than ever ... Lonely, selfish, contradictory, full of romantic and melodramatic events ... You like the reality we live in. In my view, it is lighter, painful and painful than the heroes of your story. Jumana is a thin heroine whose fragments were shattered and scattered. On its edge ... dear is not a human being, he lived his life in the forbidden pleasures and forgot himself, How repulsive I find myself when I find it sometimes says that astrology is not permissible, and sometimes you find it analyzing drinking and adultery, for you hated his behavior and his psychopathic justifications in the analysis and prohibition, he was supposed to cross the road and a truck or bulldozer came to mash all the rest of his pride, you conceited you Abdel Aziz But, hey, at the end the surprises lie .. Indeed, I found the end and it was of the open type, causing the reader to imagine the fate of each of the heroes. Full of certainty that events like this are running What in fact, I pray to God that Ragia Engjina and others of the love of such kind, I swear I live my life without love that Atjra the bitterness of this kind .. I loved you more than it should be, and loved me less than I deserve
I tell you from Bahut from Yasin from Bahia. Najeeb Sorour is creative as usual
Exceptional. Everything is okay. The channels are OK, and the internet is not running
The bakery has many branches .. The sandwich is once delicious and fresh, cheese, halloumi, labneh, thyme, chicken, etc. .. It sells cake, cupcake and juice, more suitable for breakfast or a light meal.
A nation that is satisfied with the loss of its freedom and independence and accepts to place its hand in the hands of its usurper is the most down-to-earth, inferior, and deserving of annihilation and annihilation ... a powerful and moving narration and a very beautiful language that combines the two most important elements of a successful book, namely pleasure and interest ... The witch .. I am convinced that it is better than transferring literature from non-Arabic to Arabic in the modern era .... I did not like the subject of the novel at the beginning and I did not like describing the Turks as occupiers and usurpers ... How strong is the love of homelands, love of the family, and love of the one you love And when the first collides with the second, the protagonist Constantine Brancomer does not see an escape except the third .... a novel that reveals the actual meanings of betrayal, loyalty, love, virtue, sacrifice, freedom and pain .... influential in every sense of the word.
Al-Ahmari, and what do you know? This is how to read and how to supply books. High literary language, more pleasant sayings, and more than wonderful directions on both sides of reading and writing, even if reading is the dominant thing and what is required of them or whoever wants to do them. The book does not mention everyone yes so I claim, as there are readers who do not really know how to read. From the copyright you have to talk to him, do not surrender him everything and come out no matter. The book has the right to decorate it with your pen so that it can open between you two covers. Or, as our predecessor said, the book does not enlighten until it is unfair. This is exactly what the author was doing. The book has more than just a book, and reading it is more than just reading; it is a curriculum for readers. And he ended the review by quoting his books on the farewell of his friends; the books he wrote: The wisdom of the books is difficult to transmit, and we did not increase the reader except that we shared some of the books’s pleasure and ways of dealing with them. I recommend it ..
A beautiful place, a place by the sea, in the Masbat area, the food is excellent, and the service is good. The most beautiful thing is that you eat at the sea in a beautiful place and nice music
When she presents cleaner and more respectful works, the director of the director, Fatin Abdel Wahab, manifests the film of Khatib Mama for his complete and complete understanding of the movie story that was written by the genius writer Mr. Bdair, and there are many events that take place mostly in a comic sphere where the spoiled girl, Mushira Nabil Abeed, who tells her her friend with a hidden secret about her relationship with a young man who plundered Her virginity and her deceitfulness ... The events continue, as her friend&#39;s speech falls in the hands of lawyer Talat Ahmed Mazhar, and everyone thinks that Mushira is the owner of the problem, and here many of the paradoxes presented through the film&#39;s events start in an interesting and light manner that is completely devoid of boredom, fatigue and long scenes. It can be filled with dialogues that have no significance, for every scene does not exceed three to four minutes in length, and the transition between those scenes was made in a smooth and simple way without complications or neglected remedies, in addition to using paradoxes as a kind of dramatic plot of the story and the way it is presented in parallel to the events The success of director Fateen Abdel-Wahab in the logical choice of job heroes, especially the role of Madiha Yousry Kam, who performed so brilliantly at the same time in which she played the role of a fourth-year-old woman who takes care of her daughter with the help of her father and relates to the love of lawyer Talaat Ahmed Mazhar, who was able to another From providing serious and respectful work In addition to his works that have increased his stardom, even Madiha Yousry impressed me with the degree of her mature maturity in performing many scenes with sincerity and competence, and besides the role of the protagonist of the film Madiha Yousry and Ahmed Mazhar, it comes to the role of the star Nabila Obaid, although it is not the first work and that she has appeared in many The other works are more mature and older, but she successfully managed to present that little spoiled girl ... That is why the film, in my personal view, is a good film in terms of elaborate workmanship by director Fatin Abdel Wahab, who was able to take many simple cadres that do not require any focus or depth. Thinking draws you from the warmest Female film away .lakhrj act clean, serious and respectable.
Beautiful and elaborates on some topics
Exceptional. Quietness of the hotel and service. Amendment in front of the hotel
First, I am not one of the people to her from her reading hobby, and there is nothing between me and the books. Ammar Awi..You can tell your story and a situation that you put me in. I have completed it and read such a need after what your novel has been concluded..The most important need in the novel can be missed in the accounts of another village her after the last days of the past, although she Famous needs and I took the fuss that I am not completely pure, and I read the novel, a way of narrating a new, interesting and appreciated, I say innovative and no, but it was really very interesting. The story itself was very sweet and very interesting. I sympathized with all people ... and I was upset with them at a second time. She lived with her two days with her village in them. I am sincere about a month and a half ago .. I mean, before I think, I write the reviews, I was thinking I read it again, but I said, write the first, and then read it again and write again. Generally, good luck, my friend, and I continue, I mean, you don&#39;t have to work, and waiting for a lot of other needs..But I think it is a very strong start .. with success
Literature is wider and the first door to know the enemy
good. A clean but crowded hotel, and the entrance to the hotel is narrow. A room overlooking the sea requested Atoni a room overlooking a wall
This book ..... A fortune in every sense of the word. And this writer .... is absolutely creative. He is also funny in every sense of the word. Very fun ... very nice ... very cool. I was impressed with most of it ... except that it made me hate the idea of marriage and I wonder ... Is the writer married? If he was married, it is likely that he became divorced immediately after the book was published. I was able to draw from the book as a huge number of quotes .... I advise everyone to read it ... I think it is a masterpiece of satirical literature
Wonderful and complete hotel. I liked a lot of things, its proximity to the tram, the internet is very fast, great staff, especially Amr.
One of the most beautiful human life writings and life situations. And divide the book into separate articles related to the topic. Make the book light and easy to read. The book is about self, controlling it, understanding it, and dealings with others ... The author is its author in the form of situations that he passed through and through which he talks about the positions of historical personalities and famous personalities. Too much information
Excellent. The place is excellent. There are two groceries, a pharmacy, and a large group of restaurants near it, a metro station and a ten minute drive away from the Dubai Mall. nothing
Great hotel. There is a children&#39;s club. nothing
good. . Refrigerators in all rooms are very poor
The ideal place to stay in Jeddah, and it will be my favorite destination next time. Everything was just great. Double Wi-Fi, only one elevator, the price is a little high
Excellent. Good reception and smile reception staffs quiet location. nothing
We are two peoples, see the first where and the second where. The line between the two leds Pivot:. One of the best I&#39;ve read.
A different book ... His philosophical and humorous style ... I liked the dialogue between the child and the educated cat:
good . Value for service. Bus, narrow space in the rooms
Five star hotel but as a six star service. Good handling and excellent reception from all the staff, especially brother Maher.
Tragic are the words when you come out of a father talking about his two sons with disabilities .... I did not realize the greatness of the passion of fatherhood in my life as I realized it in the pages of this thirtieth book ..... If an ordinary person writes about that horrific experience then you feel his tragedy .. But when a veteran writer experiences the experience, the words sweep you and throw you into the abyss .... speaking of the deprivation of communicating with them and the deprivation of seeing them grow up and depriving him of his wishes to see them better than him personally .... you realize that every father sees his children and They grow up praying to his Lord all night, thanking this blessing ..... It is not easy for you to clash with the fact that those who are supposed to be better than you ... are much worse than you YR ... not by their will, but because nature said its final say ... and she wanted them to be handicapped ... genetics responded to the Creator&#39;s command that the writer become two tragedies that move on four feet .... one of them has only one sentence and the other does not have Not a single movement .... and a joyful father deprived of playing, hiking and fun sharing with them .... It reaches the height of sadness and pain when the writer says a handicapped child for his parents is the end of the world ..... I have two ends of the world ... .. a painful experience I invite you to ....
The deceased was a message more than a novel that was explained in the last papers of the novel. Do until you live forever. Verbs are the ones left
The hotel is very pleasant, the location is excellent, and the luxury of the hotel. The luxury of the room.
Excellent . Everything is beautiful in every respect. Shi
A very distinct story indeed with characters in similar situations to our situation. Wajih Ghali actually wrote the novel The Age, and it is possible to tell the history, as a reference for the post-revolution period.
Ghazi Al-Qossabi’s narration style is dazzling as usual. The writer depicts the suffering of Alzheimer&#39;s patients with great precision .. It makes you thank God from the deepest depths of your heart on that memory that. God bestowed on us. It was linked in our past awareness that the torment is in an unforgettable memory .. Ghazi Al-Qossabi proved the opposite. The true pain in his memory has erased everything ... a light book that ends in one sitting ... very painful
Wonderful writer style is different and simple, and the most beautiful addition of examples to explain what he says
Quiet and treated them more than wonderful. Everything .. except the net was not good.
Enjoyable trip . Cleanliness and treatment of reception staff and workers. There is no place for washing utensils in the kitchen
Wonderful is the effort in this series .. Even if I did not like this part like the first part, I was able to come up with many details about the features of this era. And how it affected his artists ... as well as the friendship between them
This book is a reading of the biography and thought of Professor Abd al-Wahhab al-Masiri, may God Almighty have mercy on him. In it, we get to know the most important life points of this great thinker and his various ideological fluctuations, as the writer introduces us to his method of analysis and criticism, before he returns to provide an overview of his most important intellectual works, especially in particular The encyclopedia, which has a full chapter, concludes with this journey full of changes and challenges, presenting the technical interests of Al-Masiri, which are inseparable in his vision from his critical cognitive approach. What I can say is that this fruitful reading has opened my eyes to a deep thought and a unique analytical approach in dealing with problems and humanitarian issues. There is no doubt that I will have a return to the origin of this biography, that is, my intellectual journey in seeds, roots and fruit, as one of the thinkers said that life after I got acquainted with Al-Masiri&#39;s intellectual journey differs from life before reviewing it.
Saudi . Excellent reception and dealing from staff, hygiene and flexibility with guests Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Wi-Fi is weak
The book is good, full of emotional messages, and the elevator lived in it the philosophy of love in the fullest sense, but unfortunately, it was playful that inflamed Fouad Al-Rifai ..
The trip with Dar Al Hijra has become amazing. The service is excellent. Thing
This book tries to convey to the reader the truth, the whole truth, it came with a poetic hymn bearing in its folds the apparent wisdom that was more like a hymn in the one ..... Its goal is to give ......... and to feel the pleasure in giving and receiving ........ I found many of my own philosophies and my reflections on it, so I felt the euphoria of someone who reads something he knows and understands ......... . And the Arabic translation was smooth, it benefited the text and did not deviate from its context, so it was flexible and committed at the same time ......... and I think that one reading of this book is not enough for me. This time I read it after polishing the years, I may find something that I can understand more ... ..... And your feeling is continuous, the wind longs for it.
A comfortable place for a couple. Rooms are elegant and comfortable in style. Kids games inappropriate place next to the restaurant
very good. . The lack of parking for the hotel
The location is excellent with overall cleanliness. The location is opposite the bus stop, which is transported to the campus, general hygiene, and central air conditioning. The elevators are available abundantly without crowding, and the prayer and breakfast in Ramadan is available in the restaurant. Lack of tables in the restaurant, the reason for the crowd at the moment of breakfast, and they did not provide the worshipers in the mosque with breakfast. Water passes at the call to prayer and the moment of breakfast only in the restaurant.
A wonderful . Close to campus comfort. The value of the reservation appears in the RO website, but in fact the RO has been withdrawn
Exceptional. Speedy procedures in the service screen. Coffee hospitality at reception and in the room. Place the shower sprinkler, and poor maintenance
good. Breakfast is a few options.
The hotel is close to the Haram, and its price is reasonable. I liked the proximity to the campus .. the parking is very very crowded and you can not stand.
Gorgeous . Everything is perfect. nothing
Really beautiful novel, and I felt that it was quickly concluded that I was completing myself too, so I couldn&#39;t get enough of it
Definitely worth reading ... I couldn&#39;t stop reading it until I reached the last page. I was impressed by the empty language of the Imam, from any cost or concealment, and he impressed me with the breadth of his knowledge and the breadth of his chest in his quotations from various Arab and foreign writers and in various fields. It amazes me that one of them claims that he is a scholar of religion and did not read to the Imam. I was amazed at the capacity of religion and its ease, and how much we escaped from that capacity, closed by minds and hearts
As if the spirit of Hallaj wore Salah Abdel Sabour to tell about his tragedy. No strong linguistic expression like this. The idea is that the dialogues are long, strong, and relatively difficult, because they are said once, so how surprising is the time, how much was it to represent the play, and if any, it needs extraordinary strength in memorization and correct pronouncement.
Good stay. The reception treats them very classically, especially a Saudi employee, who is very kind to the hotel in this person who is very classy in his dealings. There is no note
Excellent . Everything is creative. nothing
Excellent in most respects, and a great location for providing services. Only the laundry, ironing and menu prices are faulted. Beautiful breakfast variety. But it is clear that it is prepared early, which affects the taste of some items. Only the prices for washing and ironing are too much and the internet service is difficult to obtain. I hope that this will be addressed so as not to affect the reputation of the hotel.
I did not know the secret of the violent attack on this novel, because the end did not satisfy the audience. I think it is the first part of a trilogy that Zaidan will write or so it was said .. Zidane, as usual, is a wizard and a cunning, so his literary rhetoric adorns the words of that novel. As for coercion, the genealogy was flowing between the lines. It strikes under the belt by opening controversial topics and leaves it to the reader in his neutral style. Is Zidane a religious writer, is he biased to the ideas of Islam and nationalism, or is he just a neutral who exposes things to the satisfaction of a larger audience? In the end, I believe that it is a good novel, and I am eagerly awaiting the rest of its parts.
Anything said will be considered vulgar.
good. Location, service, and price are right. The presence of a nightclub and bumbling without shame
One day we were Islam. Book summary
Abu Fajr. . The site is difficult to reach due to road excavation work
good. Flexibility of management. Request a security deposit and slow login
A wonderful novel that explodes from every word with feelings of Khazlan and weakness .. It follows events and the feeling remains the same .. How did we become like this? How have we become citizens without a homeland? How do we die without finding graves for us ... How are the world narrowing us alive and dead and in the eyes of the world we are rapists assassins The novel talks about very, very many events ... without focusing on a specific incident ... The poet, the writer, clearly appeared .. in it the brevity is not violating .. and in it the dullness is dull .. surround you with sorrow .. and pain .. and you only have to wish that embrace the sides of Jerusalem one day
Hymns in the shadow of Tamara ... and I can’t think of my nation the last time I read a book once. The idea in books is what happens and the one who reads. This is the last book of Professor Afifi. All I could think of is that he talks about all the needs that are evident to his life, meaning his wife, his garden, Hamada, and even Ibrahim, God bless his soul. Loveyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
This book is a separate text, but it impressed me some of its titles brought me back to childhood and the days of stories and stories. Texts that contain a lot of meanings and goodwill inside who can understand what he likes and likens them to situations in his life
A novel that I concluded in two days in the shadows..that&#39;s a lot of fun.
What attracted me to the book is the cover of the second printer, and I used to answer it, but unfortunately it was attached to the bookstores. By chance, I was traveling in Alexandria, and I found there another copy for it ... I was very pleased with the gift. The best poets now is to write this type of poetry .. a real, new book for him ... I wish success, Mustafa:
The least that is described is sophistication ... sophistication in feelings and progressive description of Islam .. progression in resistance and jihad for the sake of God .. improvement in friendship feelings ... In the novel, respect for a person’s conviction that he embraces the religion in which his friend is convinced is a problem in our Arab societies because we form our idea of the person through his religion, regardless of any other dimensions ..
very good. The price for service is excellent, luxury and beautiful hotel, and breakfast more than excellent. The hotel is a little gloomy and dark
Exceptional. . Away from the women&#39;s chapel on the campus
Finally, I finished the readers of the book The Ottoman Empire, which entertained me a lot. In its development and role the state of the adult caliphate. The writer started talking about the origin of the Turks, their conversion to Islam, and the establishment of the Ottoman Empire at the hands of Othman bin Artgrel. A nation that does not read its history is a lost nation between the darkness of ignorance and error, and this is our situation today. If we read our history well, we would know our enemies in our present as they were the enemies of our ancestors in the past. This book presents the plots woven against Islam and Muslims, such as Freemasonry and Zionism and how they used weak rulers to implement their despicable desires, such as Muhammad Ali Pasha, the governor of Egypt who was a poisonous dagger used by the enemies in the implementation of their plans. Between the lines of Ottoman history, my heart oscillated between the elation of the conquest of Constantinople at the hands of Mehmed the Conqueror and the deposition of Sultan Abdul Hamid II and the fall of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. At the end of the book, the writer appended the causes of the fall and collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
The shrine of Huda .. Some manifestations, and the heart traveled to Istanbul.
What is life in your opinion? . It is the battle of the soul against matter. And death, what is its location from this battle? . It is the ultimate victory of the soul. Genius and light novel, although the combination of them is difficult
She taught me with confidence that crises, despite their bitterness, are what make us ... if you are patient with me, I would have lost hope. She taught me the meaning of supreme love. And for the first time, I see the meaning of the word I love you. In the true form that you loved, Palestine, my greatest love. You will remain the symbol of resilience. The symbol of pride,. It will grow from you day by day. Who is a lump in the heart of every Zionist occupant ... The crying was nothing but heart burning. On not being with them and sharing all these conditions and circumstances. And to be the Palestinian woman, the woman I am most proud of ... and from Hebron, Khalil Rahman, Palestine,. We would, we would return, and we would be the generation of liberation .. We ... God willing, able ..:
Exceptional. Close to the metro station, providing all services around the hotel. The value is discounted and not overrated. Service and hygiene is high. Excellent for married families, it is not noisy but quiet and comfortable.
Hard, sweet book, well done
what&#39;s this . What&#39;s this wonder. I cried with you and revived hope after his death in one novel .. If I described the ivy tree, I could see its greenness. And I hear the sound of the wind between its branches. I smelled the fragrant of her perfume .. How to describe anything in the novel that I cannot give her right. Alya had my entire reading hours, as if I had moved with her heroes to the Ram Castle. Truth is, I cannot find what I describe as a novel, or describe its author, and it is enough for them ...
One of the best reads, if not the best. I memorized his phrases many of my reading to him. Creative.
The book is divided into two parts, the first part is the book itself, and the second part is the AKP and Turkish program. Part one: the book. Worth three stars. In my opinion, it was prepared by the second part of a previous book, but by another author, Ali Muhammad Muhammad al-Salabi. The book is the Ottoman Empire, the factors of the rise and the causes of the fall. The writer started the book from the time of the fall of the Ottoman Empire at the hands of Ataturk and quickly passed through the most prominent events that it passed through, especially the Islamic parties that took power like the National System Party .. Then he moved to a qualitative shift in the history of Turkish rule, which is Najm al-Din Erbakan and his parties Safety, Welfare and Happiness . In this brief, the features of the Turkish state, which are fiercely secular and loyal to the policies of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, are clear to us until the army interferes in its entirety if these principles are threatened and performs a military coup if necessary, as it did in a coup when it carried out a coup against the Najmuddin government, the problem of the Safety Party. Then the author moves to the axis of the book, which is Erdogan, then he deals with the story of his origin and his disciples at the hands of Erbakan, then he took over the Istanbul municipality, then arrested him, then he left and set up for the Justice and Development Party and passed on his three elections, the last of which was fought in the last year. The book in its entirety is good, especially in the tendency of Dr. Willing to simplify matters to suit the non-specialist. One of the bad deeds of the book was the photos in it. The book contained many pictures and it is an excellent way to clarify a lot of things, especially in maps and others, but the pictures here were misplaced and not selected accurately. They are normal pictures like Erdogan&#39;s and another image of a giant banner for his election campaign, and so if the images were selected more accurately, it would be an excellent thing. Part Two: The Party&#39;s Program. Worth five stars. The least described program as a program of understanding people. The program is based on a thorough study of the conditions and conditions of Turkish society, its capabilities and the resources available to it. A program made specifically to suit Turkey with its values, civilizational assets and available resources. Until you find that, for example, in talking about livestock, it identifies the best places for you to develop livestock. Part of fundamental rights and freedoms is one of the best approaches I&#39;ve seen, especially in its relevance to a country of a complex nature such as Turkey. The state is very secular, secular and loyal to Ataturk&#39;s policy, and the party is a party that draws its ideas from the correct Islamic approach and with a flimsy party policy, especially with the repetition of military coups, it becomes clear to us how bad the situation is, what did the founders of the party ?? They resorted to defining and defining concepts, especially with the relativity of political concepts, and created a marriage between the secularism of the state and the Islamism of the party in a wonderful political system. See in the program it. We see religion as one of the most important components of humanity and secularism as a necessary thing for democracy, with an emphasis on freedom of religion and belief and we refuse to distort secularism by making it in hostility with religion .. Secularism is a principle that allows everyone regardless of their religion and their belief in:. Freely practice their beliefs. Express their convictions the way they want to live. At the same time, secularism gives those who do not owe a debt mainly the right to organize matters of their lives consistent with this trend .. And when he spoke about the policy to which they seek they said about it. Politics is the will of society to build a present in accordance with sound rules and foundations and to carefully plan its future. There is a lot and a lot in the party’s program, but it must be emphasized that the only benefit in my opinion from this program is specialization. Each country has its own principles, values, and available resources that can be exploited. Each country must have its own experience of being affected by other experiences, not by blind transportation or application
What is the hardest human?
Exceptional. . Restaurant prices are very high
Convenience hotel and near to worship. Everything, thank God, is beautiful in this hotel. There is no
A delicious and easy book .. Of the type that is light in size, but his words reduce the heart .. What is the other is they laugh, but in general Professor Bilal preferred from the few people who laugh at me despite the difficulty of the topic I speak in .. And I like it very much because the text of the speech enters Aphorisms or words from the Qur’an ... one of my most enjoyable needs. Uh, by the way, this talk is still not valid today, which means that we need a new revolution..and I wish it with all my heart sooner rather than later ... I liked the article also, did the justice of the sky descend on the Palermo stadium because it is very appropriate to the level of Al Ahly season this .. and I will see I very much knew that Professor Ahlawy:. The last thing I was intending to apologize for reading it. But from God Ali bakarneh library, praise be to God. Not yet to say. Down, down military rule
Exceptional. . The car park
Thank Hotel Time Ruby .... The treatment of the staff is excellent, especially the reception..wi-fi is excellent ... the surrounding area has many reforms which create inconvenience and dirt ..
The right place to perform the Umrah. . Excellent price for excellent service, cleanliness .. No restaurant.
One of the most beautiful books I read and enjoyed it very much. The first thing I caught is to read it. I regretted it and I bought it for the last =. But one day I started reading it, I did not go as far as I had concluded .. It was very exciting and attractive to the reader, and I did not like it. Very good book.
Distinguished especially for non-smokers. Close to the market with Arabic coffee, beautiful views of the city or the sea.
Wonderful style and audacity in no time, it would open up. And a great illustration of events and great know-how in the world about him
Pretty shadowy, great advice backed up with examples .. I admit he had to burn full novels in a few lines. Especially the sugary and the honorable presence of Naguib ... The book varies between guidance and stories ... I liked what was in it ..
good. Location. Furniture is not up to standard for some Rotana hotels
A genius caricature, in fact, regardless of who it is, which is clearly Sadat. Seeing Sadat in this diabolical image is not surprising from a journalist in Al-Ahali newspaper, which is published by the Marxist Party, the main party. But regardless of anything, the cartoons are valid for all places, times, and rulers of the third world. I did not know that the term drumming, which means the hypocrisy of rulers, had existed since the 1970s. I thought it was a modern term. Finally, this book shows caricature as it should be
I will repeat the residence again. Easy access to and close to restaurants and supermarkets The reception staff are helpful and cheerful. The internet is weak some times The smell of the corridor is not good on the second day The price of breakfast is high.
Creativity . The location, comfort, reception, cleanliness and everything is very beautiful. nothing
When joy belittles you, go back to the depths of your heart, and you see that you are in fact rejoicing at what was once the source of your sadness .. When sadness overwhelms you meditate your heart again, you will see that you are in fact crying over what was once the source of your joy
One of the sweetest messages that I read ..... but it would be more wonderful if it were serious messages alongside his letters..and the picture of their delicious fresh story would be completed
Very interesting ideas, philosophical and sometimes provocative. What I liked most about the martyr, the birth of an idea, in the year of the million, show me God, the postman
I was amazed at the duplicity of hypocrisy, despite the different times. O people of hypocrisy that is your land .. And that is your planting .. I did only if you floated with it and offered for the sake of the sample some of it .. If you saw it ugly and distorted, do not blame me but blame yourselves .. blame the original and do not blame the mirror, hypocrites, This is your story, and whoever was without you let him stone me. A great novel
Very wonderful that may happen to any one of the women. What happened with Jamila, whose fate draws an unjust sultan who loves wars and destruction and makes men war machines that bury nostalgia and friendliness between their arsenals.
A human account of all the meaning of the word. The author deceived us to make us think that the narrator translated the story of Issa
Wonderful stay. The hotel is amazing in everything. There is no
Quality cleanliness, excellent service, unique taste
If this book indicates anything, then it indicates the man&#39;s sincerity in telling the events, so he is not afraid that people will accuse him of being strict or that his brothers will accuse him of insulting
Excellent and all services in it. Its location and services. nothing
The book concluded in one rule the beauty of style
A wonderful book for the most amazing writer .. I had never read anyone to Jaber like Rabie Jaber, so he wrote it as a kind of magic. When reading the book, a person goes to dive with the people within all the details that exist, he admires time and place and wishes that he lived the story himself .. In this novel Rabie mentions how Spring is lost on his brother Muhammad, who is several years younger than him, and how Muhammad goes out after seven years to search for him, completing his whole life abroad, moving from Granada through Andalusia, then to Morocco and Tunisia, working and moving in these years, he sees beauty and pain, and he sees many who marry Zahra and most aspects of life are completed for him in Tripoli, Lebanon, but still searching for spring: Y. After twenty-five years of research to the Dome of the high mountain and to dialogue with the spring who died .. A wonderful book worth reading
A novel is not wonderful in style and presentation of events, but it has facts that we cannot obliterate the revolution that we are going through now or if you want so say the coup history witnesses that Egypt is a country without a single revolution but the topic is in its entirety and the writer addressed this issue in particular it indicates a broad horizon and the end is unfamiliar in our Arab circles It was natural or stereotypical that the hero who killed many be imprisoned, but also the idea of the novel mimics the novel of Gram Vipers almost the same topic, but with some vaccinations that did not change the environment. The hero is a pharmacist, and the events clarify to some extent what the pharmacist suffers in our reactionary Egyptian society. How did we transform that profession into mere hands that transmit the drug only? Also, the vipers ’gram was also a note that is not longer noticeable from the frequent eating that Ahmed Murad tends in his novels and works to the degree of cost not to add new To events and will not affect if deleted. I don’t know if the imagination is sick or the writer wanted to attract a certain type of readers to buy a lot of editions. I suspect that, but also his goods from a subject and some common views attract the reader who is looking for science as he plays on the strings of market and mind requirements
My previous readings by Abd al-Wahhab Mutawa have proven that he is a great writer, and there is no doubt worthy of respect and appreciation .. And these articles have increased this evidence ... Indeed, a wise man in his decisions and worthy of people&#39;s trust and his choice to share their concerns and concerns ..
A precious name for an old hotel. The location on the sea is beautiful. The room rate for services is considered overrated. Breakfast was standard size room as well. The room location is far from having only one elevator.
A greeting to Muhammad Al Makhznji Anecdotal books are among the most beautiful things you can read ...
It was so beautiful. Everything is great.
This is how history should be studied
Exceptional. The service was great and very clean, not like four stars. God willing, something great.
From the beaches of America, passing through the history of Athens and sympathy for Khomeini&#39;s Iran and its revolution. Return to the land of Kinana Egypt. The writer wandered with his thought and analysis before stepping into his body. Squeeze the difference and awareness of its aspects. And distinguishes good from it from the malicious. It was a tourist tour of minds and their well-being, not the luxury of matter and fancy
Among the most beautiful biographical books that I have read, I loved the writer&#39;s profound reflections and questions, as well as the poetic passages that added to the book a special magic, that makes you stop reading from time to time only to keep silent and allow the words to leak into your soul.
There is no doubt that the free may cost you a high price and may compel you at times to give up principles that she was brought up with, even for a short period .. These notes highlight the writer&#39;s courage and her unique intelligence and tell about the high price that she and her family paid. Bucklist
Dubai. The room was excellent, overlooking the private pool and in some kind of privacy.
Fifty-five of this problem is present in the book &quot;Confessions of a Lover,&quot; I do not know what needs to be repeated
Wonderful, unique and fun .... the history of reading. Whoever tried it before Alberto Manguel ... You take back time passing all the paths of years to see the panorama of your fellow readers throughout history. How the book became a book. And how did I get the letters, too? And why do I read now silent. And how many times before me slept between the lines. And how many lovers he financed on the pages used to retire the world to between the two books like you ... from distant lands and from faraway times. You read the history of reading. You need a philosophy and a meditation session in order to analyze this phrase and savor the underlying content of rapture, paradox and depth, and millions of millions of millions of pages that have passed through many eyes and many hearts and have been replaced by tales, ideas and countries .... here. You will see your reading companions, hear them, and enter the secret chamber of their customs in front of the first spring: the Word. They will advise you and guide you a lot. Perhaps the names of foreign tyrannical books on the pages diminish his splendor and the thread of linking you and him, but perhaps that would be a motive for one of us, readers, to compete with Manguel and write the history of our reading ... and what we sang ...
Excellent. The staff were upgraded and assisted as much as possible. The hotel and rooms are always clean. The location is close to the Dubai Mall only and the airport.
The best book of his village by Omar Taher is not a fine traction. I enjoyed it very much, one of the first satirical political projections, judgment and preaching between the lines and the quotations of the celebrities he mentioned.
It is amazing in the consistent description of the Palestinian villages and the details of the battle events
very good. Beautiful and comfortable hotel. The room rug is old
Nasser. Wonderful reception, the location is great ... cleanliness, fast handling and services, very reasonable prices, the reception staff are great and they are comfortable. Everything I saw is excellent
A more than wonderful hotel, I went last week to Sharm El Sheikh and I went down to Sherton and found it very luxurious and clean. I stayed two days in an amazing place. The beach is wonderful and the swimming pool is wonderful and all the staff felt you were the most important guest in the hotel. I especially mention the managers of the front offices Mr. Ahmed Abaza and Mr. Mahmoud Salem And all front office employees who were solving any problem in the shortest time. So were the restaurant and the food was great
Seriously, everything is perfect, especially Mr. Muhammad, may God reward him with all good. One of the best hotels that I took a tour. Everything at the highest level
Exceptional. The place and parking are very excellent for families due to its proximity to Deira City Center and Naif Market. The pool is mixed and popular with foreigners
very good . cleanliness. The employee at the front desk was treated very poorly and unfortunately unhelpful
Exceptional. . Workers are only slow in waiting bags for rooms when registering and booking a room for up to half an hour
A very important discovery this year. Wonderful Wadih Saadeh. Have you heard about nihilism? Here nihilism will smell and breathe in his words. The office is wonderful and elegant prose. I chose for you these two syllables. . The dusters. The desolate roads of Habun alone. The earth has become dust, and here we are completing the life of dust .. We are continuing the life of the dust of the earth. This is someone who must complete his life, and here we do .. We do not complete the life of the earth, but the life of our dust. We do not complete life, but death. We came to accompany the dust in his last blow, we carried him to his resting place, and we slept with him .. The land was not like us. It is our opposite and we are its ruins. We did not come to complete that land, but to denounce it. We did not come to continue, but to deny .. No religion before us, no religion after us, no religion. Dusters without religion or religion, for dust is nothing but aerosols. They swim in a vacuum. In space whose mother or son does not Earth. In the paternity vacuum and the sonship vacuum. We are going to our God, to nothing .. We are the dusters, and this is what we saw in our blowing, this was not something before it became dust, it was nothing before we became dust. . Beauty transit. Beautiful fast transients. They don&#39;t leave a shadow. Perhaps a little dust, it soon disappears ... the most beautiful among us, abandoned his presence. Leaving a clean room vacant seat. Beautiful in the air in the absence of his voice. Clarity in the dirt with its uncultivated area. The most beautiful among us: the absentee .. Boycott the place and boycott the time lightly. Do not leave the place to overturn it, nor for the time to waste it. He devoted himself in the quick blowing, leaving no one who left his bed or wheat for his field. Retracted from the condition of walking to reach. Withdrawal from access .. Transit quickly as a migrant angel. Not leaving residency may be a place of sin. Not committing a sin, not committing a residence ... quickly under a sun that does not touch him, under rain that does not wet him, on dirt from which no impact remains. Quickly without trace, no legacy, no legacy .. He did not have enough skills to learn a language. He did not have to absorb habits. He has no language, habits, teachers, or students. Passing over language, above customs, above ranks, names and imitation ... without a name, above calling and calling ... and above gestures, except for the gesture of crossing ... and without sound, because the sound is heavy in the air ... because the sound may collide with another. It might crush another sound in space. It may disturb the breezes ... and without desire. Because the desire to establish steadfastness .. transients quickly beautiful. Do not reside in a place in which to leave the ugliness. They do not have enough time to leave a stain in the memory of the residents ... who stayed long with us, leaving spots on the fabric of our memory that we do not know how to erase them ... painful spots, wherever it is on the seats, so that we can no longer sit .. long residents take away our seats. They turn our home furniture into pieces. So that we sit, if we sit, on their ribs, on their bones ... the resident residents are crushed. As for those who pass, they do not crush anyone and no one crushes them. They shall not be trampled upon beings, nor be burdened with footsteps. Even the air does not hint at them for a moment ... without anxiety, regret, gods or followers. One faith for them: crossing ... abandoning places, homelands, fathers and sons. Restrictions. The vandals of the gallows made of iron, place, time and belonging .. They are falling, one after another, clinging to the residence. Falling with their homelands, which became an illusion. Their affiliations, which became a lie. With their paternity, which has become a burden. With their faith that kills us, kills them, and kills life ... transients have no victims. Do we therefore have to glorify life quickly, to glorify its transit, to glorify suicide? Lightly bird whisk and open Aura wing. The openness of the transit air was lightly open, and the starting air did not pass .. They passed quickly, as a moment of diminution .. They had a voice from the sparrow, from a branch, a look, from a blossoming Shamim .. Their birds were singing and leaving, not to be imprisoned in cages or paved in mummified facades. Their birds are the traveling soul, not the feathered resident .. and their fragrant fragrant flowers outside the pot ... other than the traveling, the indifferent, the tampering with the residence, the possessed, and the dead, who would have discovered the beauty of crossing? And what moment does life discover more than the moment of its absence? Is it necessary for the leave to be authenticated more than the residence permit? And, therefore, should our life be just an exercise in the beauty of leaving? The most beautiful of the departed. The most beautiful suicide. Those who did not want anything and did not take anything. Those who took one step in the river were enough to discover the waters ... the most beautiful of us who are not among us. Those who left us are light, leaving modestly, their seats for people who may come now, to this party ... a silly party, and yet the tenants do not leave the seat. But why not seats, as long as the celebrities start guests and end enemies? Let us go, then, lightly, before the daggers swallow us up, before we make the banquet dish .. The moment of reaching the celebration is the beauty of the celebration. And then, soon, the beauty becomes the departure. The departure step is always the most beautiful .. The departed people mix the breeze. As we stand to make funeral for them, let us commemorate their memory also. Because memory hinders their departure, brings them back to their place, makes them inanimate ... Memory hinders those who wish to die. And make those who want to live dead .. Let us bury it then .. to bury the memory while we sing .. It is a silly party in any case, but since we have arrived, let us sing and dance .. seconds, we may be beautiful .. but the most beautiful will remain: the absent .. Thank you Oh wonderful, I will make sure to read the rest of your work. And scheduling them within my plans
Science novel does not need to be defined ,,, advice when you finish reading it witness. . It is a British dramatic music movie adapted from this novel
very wonderful . The hotel is wonderful. nothing
My impression of it is purely psychological ... What is more terrible than just nausea, painful thoughts
A very nice novel I could not imagine its simplicity. Sad that it was less than normal, I did not see anything unique in it. She was a complainant person who did not like something looking for love. She just wanted an extraordinary person. A person who cares about every detail of life, in contrast to it, I don’t know, so my unique opinion touched me with many situations. Somewhat realistic in her view of society, because this is our situation. All that I know is that I grew a lot ... Very sad .. . Not because I broke my fingernail or cut my hair too much, sad because I knew that the simplest of my dreams would not be true. The books are my path, which I relieve from the crowd of interrogations and arrange chaos inside me. I stopped complaining and asked. Defeated ....
Dance as if nobody sees you. Sing as if no one can hear you. I love as if no one ever hurt you. How many things do this evening for the first time. O birds, O mountains, O waves, O springs, O waterfalls, O all beings, I hear your intentions calling out to me. O life. Let your products be long, and they&#39;ll come with your hand. For such lavish sorrow delight. Dance me. . There is no love story but you start with a musical movement, in which the conductor of the orchestra is not your heart, but the fate that disguises you from its stick. With it, it leads you towards a music scale that has no drawer, as long as you do not possess a symphony of age and no access key .. the musical lock. . As usual wonderful dreams. Its charming fresh language. And the depth of its analogies. As if I heard the best piano playing while I read dreams.
Excellent . The general atmosphere of the hotel.
good. The location is excellent and the resort.
The genius of Mostafa Mahmoud is embodied in his ability to analyze reality and read the future. I did not read much for Mustafa Mahmoud, but every time I finished devouring one of his books, he finished and I was in astonishment. Political circus games is not only an analysis of events that happened in the past, but also a reading of our current future and what is going on in it
very good. Our workers. Furniture provided
I felt that I was not reading if I did not read the shadows, so I worked on reading it and would finish it, God willing, completely.
One life does not tolerate options and return to correct, as if Teresa&#39;s hand, which tightened his grip on his hand, was not coincidental, if I may express it as shaking hands with the death that spread within him until he died after his return to attend, evoking love in sleep and not in intercourse makes Thomas forgive himself for his endless passion in revealing the Anna Femininity because the goal that we seek in the truth is an unknown thing that we do not know its existence after, Theresa and the body beyond the body and the balance and lightness weighs the cuff and the other flies with the cuff and not all the weight is burdensome as his body fell on her tender body ... Very personalities born from the womb of words .. If you fear the present, run away to the future, but where is the lightness?
Quite good, the price was very high, around the dinar per night, for a single room. Reaching the hotel is difficult, because I first time, very grandfather, and the services were not good, and the month for Inter was very normal.
Centro Capital is creative in the world of hospitality and I hope that its creative image will be completed. The hotel&#39;s décor is beautiful and the room gives you a good level of comfort and luxury despite its small size. The bathroom needs to be more isolated from the room, there are no meals for the rooms, but sandwiches and small meals, and the food prices are very high. There is no help in carrying the luggage. Shampoo is very bad.
excellent service . . No parking
good. . If it is in a restaurant in the hotel or at least a large and good buffet ... Unfortunately, you do not find that the rations and restaurants are far from the location of the hotel
Abu Muhammad. The hotel in general and the location of the hotel.
Excellent . Everything is excellent. There is no..
A wonderful . The location is quiet and excellent for families. Only the washing machine does not work and the testimony to God did not tell them
A book revealing the grain
Wonderful. Close proximity to the airport, convenient price, and transportation. There is no breakfast and the buffet prices are expensive and there are no restaurants beside it and bus transportation to the airport at a specific time and they did not tell me that there are two flights to the airport, one for a terminals and another for a widow and I installed the hour so he refused my receipt and made me take the taxi and took a taxi to the hotel also upon arrival at the airport
Dubai, Ibis and Dubai. . You do not have porter service
When I read this book seriously with a sense of comfort and tranquility that our Lord is always with me despite the mistakes I made with it from the best religious books I have read in my life and this is easy to write, of course, because I love the style of / Mustafa very much more than wonderful. When I read the book, it meant a sense of joy in the program, exactly
Smooth ... beautiful. My comment is that the heroine never loved her, but loved what was presented to her
Great experience with some notes. The receptionist is very excellent in his dealings and morals. I think his name is Mohamed Faidah. There was a delay in preparing the room, which arrived about an hour, but the receptionist handled the situation, and also extended the time I left the hotel to the hour, in which Morocco had some dirt on the sofa in the room. God
This is my third taste of rattin. After a third attempt I have not yet completed. After I read wills in the early morning, she decided to read them suddenly. It started out ,,, And I finished it on the same day ,,. I didn&#39;t feel the time just I was eating sheet after paper. Of the total sheet. She is all that&#39;s left. To tell the story of a man. His name is Muhammad Al-Watban or another person. The question remains. Is it true. Or a figment of fiction ???. I am still amazed. I still retrieve the events, I must understand. Dialogue with oneself was in the face and was indicative of many conflicts. Mrs. T ,, is one of the elements of the deviant society, I wonder how many lady T in reality ?? . How many Mohammed and Taban as a famous person are hiding behind a mask. Note: It has a lot of sexual hints
I highly recommend it. The kitchen is mostly kitchen appliances, there is a washing machine, an iron, and a broom, as well as you feel that you are really in your house. The apartment is spacious and has wonderful screens and two halls. Time and effort attitudes are many and misleading. The bed of the bedroom has a descending and descending and needs a change, because it is uncomfortable and the pillows are also very uncomfortable, I have a stiff neck
As the writer said:. Keep a permanent copy of it in your library, and do not neglect it, no matter what happens, to refer to it whenever your prayers bear lukewarmness and your heart is weakened. ...... A book worth reading again. :. As the writer said: Keep a permanent copy of it in your library. Do not overlook it, no matter what happens, to refer to it whenever your prayers bear lukewarmness and your heart visits weakness ..... a wonderful book worth reading again.
Search for the dead in those around you. Those who do not speak when the time for rhetoric comes ... and do not search with their open eyes for light when darkness prevails ... and do not move, no matter how slapped their faces .. Do not try to give them life, they will not accept your gifts. Leave them there ... do not bury them on the ground. The dust of the earth is created for life, not for death. Only the people who lived above it are worthy of the dust of the earth .... The account of the deceased. The sofa party. Egypt&#39;s people . It is not true that whoever gave birth did not die. The truth is that whoever did not die. Do and do not speak. Your pictures hung on the walls will inevitably come down and you will not find people who know your voice to tell you something ... It will remain only what you did ..... A wonderful novel that I liked and attracted me from the first new page in its content and in which it focuses the yogurt butter:
Nostalgia .... narrating its events is simple but with deep meanings, all its idea is about a young man who is thirteen who rises from sleep in the morning to discover that he is blind and in memory and tries to recover what he lost through the rest of the senses and his senses begin to guide him to the rich stages in his past life before the accident to begin discovering Himself again .... The story is different passages from the life of Nadim, the protagonist and the owner of memories. In the novel, we will find that we all have a happy / painful past, to whom we are a wali His feeling, the novel was written excellently and the reader would feel compatible with it if he had read it carefully
very good . New hotel featuring technology, tranquility, spacious room and decor, good reception. Its location shows its proximity to commercial places, but in reality it is farther away and taxis are not available quickly .. Restaurants are not diverse only Indian and the meal of Suhoor even though it is available as a substitute for morning breakfast, but it is specific and has foods that are not suitable for fasting people the next day and cause thirst and was replaced upon request .. Incident One was when our turn in the taxi was passed and it was because of an employee trying to win over a European family
Your only proof of freedom remains when Victor Hugo decided to present his novel The Miserable in the nineteenth century, he did not know that it would turn into this great cam of art, which met with artistic and mass success and became the main source of many of them, so the genius director Tom Hopper came to present it once Others are in a musical saga, creating a different atmosphere, with perfect craftsmanship, as if you are watching her heroes on the stage and not in front of a lyrical movie. With every scene, you will feel a desire to applaud the director Huber&#39;s ingenuity in pushing his actors to sing directly in front of the camera until you feel with their voice sadness and imprisonment and To the extreme anger of what they are subjected to, and that feeling will not diminish when you rush to sing with them as if you are one of them. A basic line for her in the movie, and she presented an aesthetic image of the mother and her great sacrifice. And the performance of each of the two stars Russell Crowe, and Hugh Jackman will not be less than the same power of Hathaway, where everyone succeeded in increasing the beautiful meanings of the novel, and far from the well-known story that was presented as much as we mentioned and I mention among them a wonderful Atef Salem, which was starred by the Egyptian screen monster Farid Shawky, this time he is forced The elves went to steal a loaf of bread, and then he is sentenced to prison. After leaving, he escapes from observation, and the officer remains sentinel looking for him to bring him back behind bars ... We find that the writer that Boublil focused in the dialogue on the true message that Hugo always presents in his writings and writings where the human message is presented through Deep dimensions were represented by a guy B freedom of human being, oppression and injustice to which it is exposed, and the bad social conditions that oppress it, the most important of which are ignorance .... and if all elements of success from the staff, story, and director are completed .... then choosing the songs presented in the movie was one of the most important elements that helped in crowning this An-Nahah, especially the first song in the opening of the movie, which, if indicated, indicates the oppression that a person is exposed to, as well as a song and other beautiful songs written by Claude Michael Schoneberg. Unfortunately, the place here will not help me to mention all the aesthetics in the film, but all I can mention and say that the film deserves to be You see it more than once in addition to being among the best elephants On a divorce, and it must be kept within your movies library.
A wonderful and quite painful novel. The novel discusses the changes that occurred in the Egyptian society in the seventies and eighties, where the economic openness and migration began to the oil countries and the repercussions of those changes from social problems that reach the level of disasters through a group of interconnected or distant stories, even if they all share in its painful return on the reader. It is undoubtedly a wonderful novel with a distinctive narrative style, but you may need to stop in the middle to catch breath ...
The rooms are spacious, the beds are large and comfortable, the services are excellent, and the swimming pools are clean and spacious. Yes, the breakfast is delicious and the bed is comfortable.
good. Good reception. The delivery service to the campus needs to be reviewed, not around an hour.
One of the simplest books that I have read, but it raises my spirits, and that shows you if a person wants to achieve something, he must persevere and work seriously, then everything can be achieved for him.
good. The place is beautiful, quiet and the location is very excellent. The price of the hotel is somewhat expensive, not inclusive of breakfast, more like a furnished apartment than a hotel, which means the person must have a toothbrush, soap shampoo and toilet bath.
good. Close to the sanctuary, quiet, the call to prayer inside the rooms is very beautiful, with the ability to control the sound. Close to restaurants and shopping. Multiple, spacious and clean lifts open the breath of an excellent and wonderful Ramadan breakfast buffet. There is no Wi-Fi inside the rooms. Slow services when requesting cleaning. When requesting laundry and ironing services when ordering an extra mattress, tell us: there are no rooms that are too narrow and not worth the value paid per night, which is close to riyals. Tea and no sugar just give you three cans of water with every room cleaning
Injustice must be done by another, and by night, and to see in our world the death of tyranny and bright light and wonders.
Corruption, injustice, oppression, silence on the right to indulge in claiming rights, and thus pictures of Khairy Shalaby this time. He called them bastards, and I call them I, the tormented, in the earth. These are the people who have been humiliated and insulted to themselves without the slightest resistance from them to submit to those who are stronger, believing that they are helpless ... These are the idiots of this age and every age.
Almost one of the best books I read recently. A very cynical style, I couldn&#39;t prevent myself many times from laughing and I couldn&#39;t prevent myself either in the case of the country. Bravo, Bilal
Excellent. The hotel is really nice and clean, and its location is not far from the Prophet’s Mosque, especially the women’s department and the hotel’s service, and her grandmother is one of the best collaborators with me. There may be some excavation and construction work nearby, but it was not permanent. Likewise, when the street near the hotel has a traffic jam, especially the back, it is somewhat inconvenient, and it is not permanent. I recommend the upper valley from above.
Her style is charming, flowing, gasping behind, vital, fresh, fresh ..... to read to Sanaa Al-Bisi, meaning to enjoy a certain pleasure
My first experience with Farouk Jouida ... and it will not be the last.
The book, despite the element of suspense, needs a mental effort to read it. Was Zidan neutral as he stated in writing, I am certain that it was not so, as it is not possible for a person to easily evade his religious intellectual affiliation completely, but I know that he tried and with great seriousness to trace history and transfer it in a way that shows his true existence. Zidane elaborated on explaining Arabic theology and shred it. As for the connection of religious violence with theology, it was not clear or sufficient, but rather was closer in his conversation with creation. The book is very good and I hope you can see it, but one book is definitely not enough to be an objective and comprehensive view. Inevitably we need more books on the same topics that the author explained
Championship, motivation and the main driver of events are the revolutionary idea and situation and the desire to make a fundamental change in society, not people. The idea that Dostoevsky clearly declares his wish to change and rebel for a better life is why people give such great attention to others&#39; opinions about them, that they control their lives and are considered their weak point and through which they can easily control them with the remote control. The analysis is still waiting for me to have the opportunity to give him the right to write in detail, perhaps after finishing the second part. When I had the opportunity to complete what I started, I found that the supplement was required:. You are confused as you approach the end of this chapter in the classification of characters .. From a good and a wicked person in particular Nikolai Staffogen .. He and his friend Peter are very complex and very complex personalities that curse them sometimes sympathize with them and seek excuse for them. In the end, you really find yourself wondering: Will I know at the end of the novel who the demons are, and whether they include the father and teacher Stephen Trovimovich .. He is the other who seems to suffer from diseases of selfishness, negativity and inaction, the inability to resolve any issue or make any decision .. These characters are considered to be rejected characters in Societies preparing for a fundamental social change in them, where the negative intellectual is hated and undesirable .. It does not provide, but delay. One of the most wonderful dialogues in the novel is Stephen&#39;s dialogue with Varvara Petrovna, as she attacked him violently, accusing him of wanting to exclusively acquire knowledge, and in return, he despises others on the pretext that he is more knowledgeable .. He is stingy with his knowledge so he is responsible for what they reached and directly to. Rather, we find that he himself is frank with himself and reveals it in front of his friend, the narrator, and admits that he is like a capricious child, who has many freaks, and he says: You have put your finger, my friend, on a painful sore point, and that the friendly fingers are cruel, merciless, but lack civility. Sometimes I think of this woman, Farvara Petrovna, who has reached that whole amount of generosity, tolerance and patience towards my bad faults, the truth is that she is not a lot of patience. But is it permissible for me to complain about the bad nature of myself, who I likened to the child in extreme selfishness without having the innocence of the child ?? As usual, in light of societal developments, we find that there is no dialogue between the heroes of any revolutionary movement that is free of these sentences that bounce by rebelling against the frozen ideas that the clerics boil in order to control the poor of society and compel them with religious authority to accept the class differences and the abhorrent reality to them, this sentence came to Stefan Trofimovich:. The more painful a difficult life for a person, and the more miserable persecuted people are, the more persistent the dreams of rewards that they will receive in Paradise. And of course, you do not find a society devoid of the likes of Leputin the chatter, the gossip that does not stop rhythm among some friends to control them and know their weaknesses and influence them through them ... And we find that this is what Ibn Stephan excelled in controlling the wife of the ruler, which is what we will find in the second part The conflict rages, and the ends begin to take clear paths
The real problem with Ahmed Murad is that he writes and sets his eyes on TV and cinema. Vertigo may have escaped being the beginning, but the dust of diamonds fell into the trap and the blue elephant came to deepen the problem as a psychiatrist. Storming the world, but a sad and angry novelist who escaped a great opportunity to write a novel about a mysterious magical world spoiled by Ahmed Murad with the jinn and the goblins and Habshanat the three-star horror book of the idea and the effort and sadness to rush and the desire to make a fictitious world and your consideration as blocks in mind for cinema and hill scenes TV, not the book reader
excellent . Everything is beautiful, amazing and amazing. No water bidet
Wonderful book, including the meanings of the letters. Very light despite the amount of information presented in it and its ease of absorption, especially for those who are not inclined to books on philosophy and religions. The author got off to a strong start with those heavy questions in the eyes of those who are ignorant of it and simple in view of those who worked hard to know the details of our religion, Islam. So the difference between Islam and other religions is thank God that I was aware of the answer in advance, if somewhat shallow. Hence, the story of the search started with Ben Atheism, Christ, Gentiles and others. I learned many things that I went through daily and I never thought of them as the names of the gods and their meanings. And how it has become the names of famous landmarks, brands and others. Also, I always wondered why they worshiped the Buddha to this degree. Ignorance reached them, so the writer explained the story of the Buddha, why did people start worshiping him, etc. In addition, I liked his dialogue with foreigners, and his attempt to lure them without fanaticism, leaving them with a chance to think without pressure. In particular, his conversation with the woman, and how verses from Surat Al-Nisaa misinterpreted what is apparent before her and not in the hidden sense. Here lies the miracles of the Qur’an, and we do not learn from the Qur’an from the first reading and the first thought, but it needs care, attention and effort to take all the benefits from it, so let the Qur’an be the spring of our hearts. As for his visit to the church, my curiosity has increased around me for as long as I wanted to explore it from the inside and I am trying to enter into dialogue with them, except my fear prevents me and the poverty of information brings me back steps back. In a chapter, a soul, and their pastors, he spoke about human personalities and their types inferred from the Holy Qur’an, and he impressed me. The book as a whole is very useful, showing the writer&#39;s eagerness to deliver information in a simple and clear way despite the diversity of information. He did not hesitate to put evidence from all religions. There is a quote that I like the quotation of German physicist Werner Heisenberg. You will likely become an atheist when you drink from the cup of knowledge, but be absolutely certain that you will find God awaiting you at the end of the cup
To be honest, the hotel is more than wonderful, I strongly advise everyone to book a service in it more than five stars from the rooms, the service, the luxury and the food. Everyone book the Kempinski Hotel Bahrain and live the experience and live the comfortable location in the city center near the sea and restaurants and you are in the center of the city center.
A truly wonderful book that contains all kinds of mixed feelings .. How beautiful it is to feel the joy of a person who converted to Islam on your hands. Islam is convinced ... I am really happy that I read it::
Exceptional. Neighborhood. The date of the exit
I do not know what to say .. I am afraid to write here so he who reads the novel has not yet read, and I steal the joy from it for this .. All I can say is that the novel deserves reading, in which Saud Al-Sanousi matures in writing in the same novel chapter by chapter, read it: deserves it ... As for my detailed reading about it, and with a critical attempt, you can read it through this link: : //. . .... a pleasant reading that I hope for everyone, with novel and review:
A trip to Sharjah. Collect what is mentioned. nothing
Excellent and classy service. . nothing
good. The location and proximity to the campus are very excellent. The cleanliness is excellent. Easy to enter and leave, to provide four lifts, I think. Small size of the room tight, slow elevator
Philosophy lover scattered on the petals and rose,. For every petal in which there is a message for his lover, whom you have hidden over this lover,. A special language in itself, which Al-Rafii created for himself before talking to his lover. Starting from his message What did before, and ending with peace be upon her .. The book is one of the most beautiful trips that the city of lovers passes through, where you learn a lot of their secrets. My advice to young people: Love on the way to Rafii. And for girls: do not satisfy yourself that you have a boyfriend, but make him a lover so that you can capture him. My question: Is there in our time another elevator?
A wonderful novel
Something changed in my soul, and I find it in front of me. The end of this narration coincides with a forbidden martyrdom. How much can a person tolerate injustice while he is dumb deaf, not attached to his heart .... like hearing his senses, but Iyad was harder and stronger, and this is what I find clear Iyad was imprisoned for a cause that was its basis and proud of it. As for Mustafa, he was imprisoned for a case that has nothing to do with it. Therefore, Iyad came out with joy and victory. As for that, he was wronged .....
Distinctive. Excellent stay. nothing
More than excellent comfort. Everything is beautiful. Breakfast is not suitable for Arabs and Gulf people
The review is the outcome of the contraction that has befallen my heart, especially as I read the book. Four months after the overthrow of the Brotherhood’s regime, which sat for a year on the chair of Egypt’s rule. With every painful scene in the scenario of religious rule in Iran, I was imagining it to happen in my country. It was such an awful feeling that I was relieved when I concluded the book. I wish with all my heart the salvation of the Iranians, the book brought me a lot closer to them. A people that is not said in our Sunni religious channels other than Shiite rejectionists. Do you not know when the people are null and void, killed and tortured in the name of religion and God? The book will emotionally drain you. Advice: Do not read the book when you are sad
Wonderful, wonderful Imam ..
A very narrow window overlooking multiple worlds is the perfect title for this wonderful book. It talks about the mechanisms of government, popular movements and revolutions over the past hundred years with lightness, simplicity, finite simplicity, and diverse and easy style .. The book does not speak from the historical point of view, but speaks from the causal side And leaves the reader with the door open to discuss the topics he deals with, revolutions, popular movements, and purely political terms .. The writer&#39;s opinions are very neutral and do not favor one faction but another but speak for the people, the marginalized, and the lost rights holders, and this is a great strength for the writer.
With you ... there are half solutions. And half-positions. And half-sensations. Everything is with you. Be an earthquake or be. And every day with you. Be a coup or be. And every kiss on your mouth. Be hell. Or be. How can I win the battle. And I am one man. You are a tribe of women. With you. A man is born by chance. He dies by chance
Center . The bath of Assyria was high and difficult to enter. The bath of Assyria was high and difficult to enter
A beautiful, interesting book, which is messages that have reached the writer and he replies to them. It is worth reading
Excellent. Location cleanliness. There is free Wi-Fi only for some rooms
This is a wonderful book. I recommend reading it
Wonderful. . There is no children&#39;s pool
A mature couple with a child. everything. Shi
A book that starts from scratch with jihad operations in Saudi Arabia, the author divides jihad into two classical jihad, which generally represents a speech in Chechnya and the global jihad that represents bin Laden, the author studies how to start jihad in Afghanistan and how the Saudi government was supporting the Mujahideen and receiving them as heroes. Then how the repression that happened to the Awakening in general and the jihadists in particular in the mid-nineties What made many after their release tend to Al Qaeda and the global jihad that many were not convinced before this suppression because it causes a lot of controversy unlike the classic jihad that comfort the Saudi mind more since it is an aggression against an infidel gas in Chechnya, for example, the author progresses with history down to The September events that caused al-Qaeda to direct its operations into Saudi Arabia after the fall of the Taliban in Kabul, and how the dispute between al-Zawahiri and bin Laden was against al-Eiri, who saw the inappropriate time to launch an attack inside the kingdom, but bin Laden’s insistence and launching suicide attacks gradually weakened al-Qaeda to That almost ended. There is a lot also that the author on Chechnya, Bosnia and other sub-fronts touched upon, if you will .. In my view, the book is very excellent for those who wanted to understand that stage. The author studies the stage in a largely neutral and rational manner, and the translator I see is according to the currency simply language.
She ended my turn, and I am not home? I don&#39;t know, maybe I am not focused. The ideas held by the novel are great:. I&#39;ll write review, but stay focused
Among the books that were hesitated at the time of reading between high praise or intense criticism and ridiculous of his idea, so the decision to start existed, but the opportunity did not come until a few days ago when I was arranging my electronic library and I found the book and started reading its beginnings in the afternoon and between the boredom of work and exhaustion it was the decision to read it Successful, he was able to lightly turn those gloomy environments into happiness and endless smiles .. What is love if not accepting the other party no matter what? . The book is a compilation of articles from the beautiful blog Muhammad Al-Dabaa and who knows the blog and its owner knows very well any beauty awaits the translation is amazing and very elegant and the options are elegant and ideal if you describe it I felt light and I read some articles and I used to feel sudden love for everything / around me and sometimes I felt that I was above a cloud I was smiling, dreaming, thinking, agreeing and objecting at the same moment, I do not know how, but this happened on most pages .. I admit that I am opposed to the idea of collecting tweets, posts, or even newspaper articles in a book most of the time, but if what is to be published with such beauty is welcome With him and hello I will clap with all my strength and Love for those who make me happy in this way and for those who touch my soul with this kindness .. A very elegant book, and if it was longer, I would never feel bored so I will love reading to Muhammad many times and I will wait for what he publishes with passion and love, whether in his blog or even in a book or newspaper.
Hotel to relax. The comfort of the place is far from the hassle and provides all the capabilities of the hotel. Away from services like restaurants, laundries and groceries
Wonderful. Swimming pool. Towels not available
I think that loneliness or isolation is not a word that the writer used to write his book. As for loneliness, he does not know it for the one who lived it. Loneliness may be useful at times for some people who do not speak the truth. Loneliness is either if the person knows the truth or gets mad
Great weekend. The room is spacious, bathroom is great. The place is very luxurious. Marine activities and games are excellent, and the hotel has a wild market for restaurants, supermarkets and ATMs.
The first time I read Lahcen the soldier .. and it will not be the last time .. What, uncle de .. All this is a real imagination .. You really knew that I was transporting myself to be the hero ... The idea of revenge by eating the organs in them is a bit disgusting, but there is a little justice .. And they really did not leave him a choice
Exceptional. Suitable for someone who does not care about appearances, clean hotel and excellent location on top of hotels in the same category ..
Who among us does not need a dose of ethics. To a life with a dream we can dream of. I think it is too far away to be impossible. The land of comic hypocrisy, which unfairly narrated. Or so I see it. A long time ago I didn&#39;t see the movie, and I forgot it very much. The novel at that time is a coincidence. Youssef El Sebaei is a distinctive sign of me. I started living with him with my imaginations away from the movie. We all have many doses. Of courage, virility and lack of hypocrisy. But we show the worst of us in order to live. Natural aggressive human come to dominate. The idea of the novel is great in the overall
I bought it based on the seller&#39;s insistence that it is a novel that really deserves reading, and I had reservations about his opinion because the name of the novel did not attract me and I had not read the writer before and the cover story was talking about that the novel has a relationship with politics and I do not like this type of narration .. I expected when I started it I will not continue more than a page on it before I get rid of it and start a new narration .. Frankly, after I finish it I feel ashamed of myself because I ruled an excellent narration of failure only from its name and the profile about it .. Excellent and very enjoyable but it is not light reading it needs time, focus and enjoyment By events .. encouraged me to read pain The hands of the writer.
It may be in divulging the intention to do something extremely dangerous, such as killing, for example, which calls for ridicule, indifference and lack of belief. What is expected from murder is the lack of expectation and what is dreaded by fear, but it is the veil of the ambiguous ambiguity and the veil of silence that masks the mouth of desire. The genius work that struck with all the rules of excitement and suspense displayed on the wall. The novel began with what it should end with, and the reader laid out all the details in the hands of the reader that could have become a glimmer of light that traces its effect in order to reach where it should lead to events in its usual sequence. Nevertheless, the feeling of amazement, attraction, and desire to complete it will not leave you. You will remain tense to the last page .. You cannot read this novel without realizing it. It is indeed inspired by a true story that Marquis knows heroes personally .. I am still under the stress of my emotion while describing the traumatic incident. How did Santiago receive the death that caught it by surprise and without any knowledge of the hidden reason behind it ?? How did the people of that village sleep in peace after they all participated in that crime? . Did the circumstances combine on that particular day to facilitate its occurrence without causing obstruction? . Many questions will grow in your head and no harvest season.
The book is light and fascinating ... it opens the reader a room to think and give himself an opportunity to ask the questions mentioned by the author ... The writer spoke about the fact that he supported it with texts from the Holy Quran .. The book is beautiful.
A novel based on a real incident that took place in Damascus in the Jewish Quarter in a year that shows the extent of the malice of the Jews and the horror of the teachings of the Talmud
Recreation. everything. There is no
Because of the end of the night there is no lord
comfortable . The interest was remarkable, especially the employee Nayef was very professional and courteous. Parking We were reminded that the parking would be in another hotel while we knew in advance that there were parking spaces and we actually took the parking card from the official while they denied at the reception that there was an empty parking lot
Excellent. . The employee who was in the restaurant was very nervous ... and not smiling and complaining, she was having dinner on Friday evening.
The hotel is more than wonderful. The comfort and quietness, and the staff from the reception to the restaurant for cleanliness were very good. The room control screen was amazing and beautiful. I suggest providing a chair for the elderly while taking a shower, as there is no bathtub
Gorgeous . Hadi, excellent, clean, close to services and high morals.
good. New you can not miss, and God is very beautiful and beautiful. The positions have no shade until after noon
Exceptional. . Breakfast
A novel that refuses to leave it until the wall clock comes to its last accuracy ...
. The reception staff are helpful, cleanliness, location and views. The absence of a washing machine and a microwave in the apartment, as it is considered an essential thing for the family
This high evaluation of the importance of the book, not to admire it, including ... one snapshot of one witness to one criminal from the era of demons initiated by the great demon Satan Gamal Abdel Nasser. In which they replace the late English occupation at the hands of their agents and their military guilty criminals who were criminalized in the right of their nation unless the occupation itself criminalized .. Khurshid was able to appear in the media after the January Revolution, but the book remains more important than its TV interviews, although in these meetings more What about the book .. And the most important thing I see D focus on him from the lessons and benefits of this book: that a person under tyranny loses all his defensive elements and all kinds of his dignity, even the innate ones, so he can accept that the husband of a woman knows everyone that she is another lover, and accepts to marry a woman who knows that she is another partner .. Because resistance to tyranny rises to the level of duty imposed on every free person, silence does not exempt from damages.
good. . Location of the hotel in the city and far from the beach
Grand needs better development. The location of the hotel. Various services. The price is overrated compared to hotels that offer a better standard
Quiet fun, hotel design and cleanliness. . Firstly, a very cool design, the room space is suitable for two people, and with a break, the calm is wonderful, which makes you enjoy excellent hygiene. Air conditioning, Islam. The bad experience is that when the sewage is withdrawn, the tow truck is stopped in front of the hotel entrance, which makes the unpleasant smells spread all over the place, so it gives an unlimited impression of the hotel
A family place to clear your mind and rest. Excellent handling at reception by employee Ali Al-Mansoori, follow-up and diligence thanks him and quick response to each request, thank you brother Ali.
It really is a good bargain. God bless you, Dr. Khaled ..:
very good. Location and cleanliness. The water cycle disposes of water
very good. . The lifts are crowded and my lack of security through the corridors due to the inconvenience
Indeed, when you believe in something and become involved with a group of those who share your faith and love you, you become a striking force capable of doing anything. But as soon as the individual engages in an audience, he takes the traits of what he was there or it can be said that they exist, but he did not dare to reveal it and express it. The individual, once engaged in an audience, loses his mentality, acts reasonably and is governed by emotions. Inspiring images and cheerful slogans are what take over the soul of the audience. Even tyrants are eager to inspire the imagination of the masses and the flames of their enthusiasm. A beautiful book, I recommend reading it, especially in these days in which we live because of the revolutions, demonstrations and sit-ins
Men should check out this book:
One of the most wonderful books God made Abraham. She lived with herself and sympathized with her frustrations and her constant struggle for her simple, humble dreams. I liked the news clips and linked to the events. And the fact that it was hard for Egypt is strong for you, O our country
Room maintenance is required, otherwise the hotel will be closed. Unfortunately, nothing I liked. The elevator is deactivating the room, the wall adjacent to the toilet has a leaky water from the top. Unfortunately, breakfast buffet has foods that are not suitable for human use.
Exceptional. . The fridge does not work
Words cannot describe. Simply beyond imagination
Very very cool, Sarah, hard. I love to read to you too:
What I really liked about the prince of this book is inclusivity and ingenious thinking. He left no room but had distinguished himself in it. Electronics and mechanics. Physical training. Physical strength. Political thought. Family passion. Indeed, an integral personality .. the father of the Zionists to leave him to complete the results of genius .. God bless this captive prince
Qushtumur second reading:. The first reading was in a microbus and I am returning after I bought Qeshmutr for 6 pounds in Mansoura. The story is not about the five friends. The narrator is a friend of a spectator who did not appear in his capacity as merely transferring and commenting on Taher Al-Adri and Hamada Ibn Al-Thawat, who loves the thing and turns against it. ..And it is true that there is no more correct concept of happiness .. There is a reference to the book “The Return of the Sheikh that Al-Sabbagh brought to one of the characters of the novel.” This is what came to my mind where Professor Muhammad Abdul Nabi brought his novel The Return of the Sheikh. The last for the bitch and the storyteller. / Quoting from the narrator before we are guided to Qushtamur coffee .. Then he guided us al-Hadi to Qushtamur coffee as a kind of affirmation of meaning and uniting the class. The walls hear about humans, the coffee is left and friends are fleeting.
I like the novel, I liked it, yes, it feels that it was a lot of films, but it attracted me, because of the curiosity in me, I know the end, and I see the Assiut, and he reveals the truth
Enjoyable. Fine dining, fast access, and room service. They have a varied menu. The inclination of the bathroom floor is not clear, which causes the water to accumulate on the floor
Good, worth a visit. Good, but describe your meal to get the additions to the account
Bear and insist. Greetings to you, hero hero. And pray that your family be relieved. ... After Jerusalem, there is nothing but Jerusalem, and only after Jerusalem is Qassam
Excellent. What I liked is the receptionist, Amir Dwameh, the evening that he asks about, his treatment is very classy and respectful, and the shortest of my services.
Abu Farah and the family in Ramada. Greetings, after the rooftop pool is small and the air condition sounds very annoying. Breakfast buffet has few options for Arabs and most of the items are suitable for the Chinese community. The jacuzzi is terrible, the sauna and tranquility, respectful and upscale staff treatment, valet parking is available
A pleasant stay with the Elaf Mashal Al-Madinah Hotel. Certainly the cleanliness at the front, new furniture, varied breakfast, good reception and welcome. nothing
Coffee is a friend who is waiting .. Isn&#39;t coffee a drink of sorrows and travel stations to meet friends .. She is a friend who is waiting ..
I finished the first book in the series. The task is impossible. I can almost assure it is not easy, but not impossible. All we need is to get tired to do the job. A book that benefited me very very much. This book is an invitation to reflect on how to perform a prayer that has become unfortunately a habit and not a cult. Believe me, if I read this book, you will think and focus on the details of the prayer, which has only performed movements as if it were a sport only .. God willing, I will start with the second book in the series ... Thank you Ahmed Khairi Al-Omari:
No monster in the tomb of Maryam. Radwa Ashour transports you forever and the lives of Andalusian Muslims, their torments very easily .... One of the most wonderful things I read and benefited from the book a lot
I liked the novel very much, but its first novel, Time of Hyenas, remains the best
Recommend buying
good . Location. The rest of the restaurants are at the entrance
Nice experience. The location is great. Excellent cleanliness. The deal is great. It is recommended and especially for families.
When I finished this book .. I felt that I was not the same person who started reading it .. It was something of me was with them and I was among them, and I am the one who is tormented and I feel the bitterness of their days. And you are reading this book stripped of your entire humanity so that you can complete and continue in the hope that criminals will get what they deserve .. I felt that my humanity is collapsing and I am reading that young man who is tormenting his father, the elder Sheikh or in front of those dirt that they ate. As if it were a world that does not exist, a world that no one knows but God knows ..
very good. . The water heaters in the toilets are not activated
For fun, address ambassadors of guidance. Everything. Wi-Fi is very weak
Thanks Roshan Hotel. The location, layout and design of the hotel and the hotel staff are great.
I read it from a long time ago
Very cool how to coordinate ideas and gradualism in the dialogue. I have always thought about these subjects, but my thinking has not reached them with such precision and comprehension. His method of persuasion is as impressive as it is in writing.
To start with, the most beautiful thing about this novel is the apparent change in the personality of the wolf Omar ... He turns from a reckless young man who does not even perform his prayers .. He does not know anything about his religion ... without a goal .. Oh God only collect money in every way .. legal or not legitimacy. To the strength of the Mujahid, Omar Dsarov ... who sacrifices the precious and precious for his religion and his cause, which he believes in the most faith .. Negatives from my point of view :. As everyone mentioned .. Lots of spelling and spelling mistakes .. The dialogue that took place between Omar and the leader of the Arab camp who was an aide to the Mujahid was a speech that God had mercy on and accepted as a martyr: The writer mentioned that he said to Omar do you know what the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said about your country ? He said that its people are the best on earth. Of course, as it is known .. the hadith is weak ... and we in Egypt are now suffering from the scourge of the spread of this hadith as correct. So it caught my eye very hard .. I wanted to mention it. Most of the dialogues revolve around the issue being the issue of the nation in the first place .. Yes, I mentioned the issue of religion a lot .. What we know about Chechen jihad is that it is an authentic ideological. The end was not what I expected .. Throughout the story and I feel happy .. But the end saddened me a lot .. It was crying especially for the presence of the innocent child who will be orphaned in the end:. My positives:. A novel that talks about Chechen jihad .. This in itself is creativity:. Although many did not like coordination and the method of moving from one event to another .. However, he liked me a lot .. but he needed more skill: .. I hope that this aspect will be corrected in the upcoming works of the writer, God willing:. The information in the novel is very useful and useful .. I felt shy about my lack of information about the history of the forgotten Caucasus:. But it forced me to read its history and study it, God willing:. The development of the Omar dialect was an excellent symbol of the change of his personality, mentality, thoughts, and method. Finally, with confidence .. I recommend reading it
But man is an issue .... we have a return, God willing
The best place to go diving in Dahab If you are going to go to diving or learn to dive, this is the perfect place. Mohamed is an expert, careful and patient trainer, with a good sense of humor, and funny postures. He is a great person to spend diving days with. I spent a week here and did both the open water course, and then two more days to learn diving instructions, and without any fatigue the best holidays, and a great value worth the price. I cannot recommend this place enough
If you are not present in the situation, be wherever you want ... The important thing is that you do not attend the situation, so wherever you want, standing for prayer or sitting for wine, both are the same ...
Exceeded my expectations. Everything is great and more than wonderful. Excellent location adjacent to the Galleria Mall, separated by the elevator. Valet parking is fast and excellent. The room is more than wonderful and spacious. Hanimon, butler service, is beautiful, the bed is spacious, and the mattress is comfortable. The Sambousek restaurant is terrible, but expensive. nothing
Exceptional. The location is excellent, everything around you. There is a bar that contains tea and sugar only, there is no palm or coffee
Tolan and peace of mind. Everything. nothing
Really. Do we deserve democracy ??????
Calm down. The place is very cool and very quiet.
Following a recommendation from Rawan Al-Arfaj. . The book is generally interesting and interesting. A presentation to the accompanying minister about his events between him and the heads of some countries. I liked the events a lot, especially speaking about Gaddafi, the Queen of Britain and Saddam Hussein. And the events during the screening of the death of his Emir, which in my turn, I yearn to see .. His words about Indira Gandhi and about Bourguiba. The book is one of the best books I&#39;ve read
The novel is wonderful. I used to see that the man is the hero almost to the point of his forgiveness, but after this, her reaction became the hero and from his wall. The presentation style was very interesting
I started reading the blue elephant and in my vertigo memory that I did not find different from the cheap teenage stories, linguistically weak and naive in building events. The beginning of the blue elephant gave me a temporary negative impression, from rhetorical expressions that are sometimes lenient and smoldering, but it started to dwindle with the progress of the pages of the novel, and it really impressed me with innovative analogies that are not like the absurd Vertigo similes, until they shine artistically and stylist as we near the end. I still have to point out a few minor negatives: / Contradiction: the page of an honest wound on the left hand, a page on the right .. / Some English phrases have errors, which may be typographical .. / Confusion between the vocabulary of the leg and the leg, the humerus and the forearm .. / Excessive use of impulses, intimidation, impulse ... etc. Wrong use, and stylistically monotonous .. / Combining wheat from the flesh of simile, it looked like someone feeds a gold ring with stones from Zalat .. The writer&#39;s style evolved a lot from his first novel, and his rhetorical skills were evident, but they needed linguistic refinement. He had mentioned at the signing ceremony of the novel his reading of the book of jurisprudence Al-Thaalabi, and he meant the jurisprudence of language and it is a small heritage book, despite its importance does not fit our time. The first is that the dictionaries of error and linguistic correctness, the best of which are written by Dr. Ahmad Mukhtar Omar .. Finally, I see that we have discovered a novelist promising the best always in what will be written.
Nice story. I got upset and enjoyed it. The novel achieved the desired goal. In the beginning, the cannibal part was achieved, the goal of which was totally disgusting. I felt nauseous. The novel sat sat and got into grown. I woke up I said I must complete it. The part when I met the master of the elves, I was a reader, and I imagined everything in my brain. Attracting the violin light cut off terror provided weakness. The end is successful. It is because there is no one who can change his destiny. The writer bowed me. But advice is enough for the blood of people, not lacking
His style is simple and profound, and he wounds frankly and at exam time. Not because the same field of study is the same age. I have an electronic version of my village, but I would like to turn it over and buy it and read it more than once, so that the stage de me in my mind would have been working for me.
good. Close to the Corniche. The hall is small, one bathroom and all rooms overlook the skylight
A beautiful novel that gives you the opportunity to ask .. What if? And I think the movie would not underestimate her right if I prefer reading.
The location of the restaurant is strategic, as it is in downtown, and in front of the Boston Common garden. Many menus brag to the menu. The menu is very diverse and sometimes you suspect that they can master one dish, but the rest is to increase the number, but virtually black master. Authorities are normal and reasonable prices in the rest of the restaurants in the region
I really knew what the hero of some is .... in a nutshell ... a first-class journalistic encyclopedia ... an unprecedented experience in the media world ... especially the Arab .... a lot of controversy about it ... and it will remain controversial ... as is his writing .... the book corrected many of the beliefs about Atwan ... that were not based on tangible evidence ... but perhaps only on hasty and emotional accusations ... he will remain one of the best contemporary co-workers ever .... and I am proud to have read His abbreviated experience in an interesting book that no one can tire of ... I wait for the next, O Abdul Bari ... as long as you are proud of the Arab media ... which was and still is ... one of our strongest weapons against Western expansion ... in the media in particular a ..
Exceptional. . The price of meals for the rooms is very high
I liked the book, very interesting and interesting. The writer&#39;s style is beautiful and light on the continent, not heavy from him.
very good . Very beautiful and the bed is comfortable.
very good. I liked everything first, the location of the cleaning service. Small lobby, small bathrooms and crowded elevators
Fun for a first time visit to Dubai. Sauna and jacuzzi are close to the creek and metro station. The variety in the breakfast was not some inconvenience from the planes
Because Diet Center does not have to replace it with Subway:
Good for sleep only. . The presence of parking spaces in the basement of the architecture is excellent, somewhat quiet. The whirlpool has several notes:. Smell . The sprinkler has rust. Sink mixer is not good.
My soul flew with this book in the beauty and divine majesty .... Makes your thinking dive in search of your common sense and what God has bestowed on you from the magic of divine beauty, all of that away from the smoke of fires burning in this time that starved of religiousness and commitment to captivity in the cage of appearances and lust for speech. This reduces her religion in a piece of cloth here and the other in a few words, mastered by memorizing them, while neglecting them from spider webs that covered the features of splendor and majesty that are ready for love of majesty and beauty. May make you reconsider your religion
Beautiful stay. every thing is excellent. Some inconvenience and fire alarm
Of course, the first issue of the series is not the best of them, and it may be the least of them in the level, but it is the first and the beginning of a series of the most successful series in Egypt and the Arab world.
.............. Very cool, I enjoyed it so much and laughed so much
Calm down. The furniture is clean, tidy and quiet.
This is a strange, strange, and unique novel; the story that does not tell events but tells about people while they live events; not full of facts, but full of the latest of them by the state of the soul, its sighs, hiccups, circles, and labyrinth during these facts .. a novel from a unique world created by Dostoevsky alone, not only superior but professional He did not weave a story to tell but rather accompany you and summoned you to enter the story so that you can see it before your eyes and feel .. feel everything slowly and anxious and confused and foolish and crazy Dostoyevsky knows very well the difference between people talking about what happened to them and their talking about what they felt during that and he chose to make the whole novel about the second and was able so ably. In the middle of the novel, I felt a severe psychological fatigue from the psychological struggle that exists within all the heroes, Dostoevsky did not make Raskolnikov a center of the novel but rather made the human psyche a place that everyone shares in a greater or lesser degree. And deep inside the human soul. Dostoyevsky, you raise the hat on this piece of literary rich in human feelings
Wonderful descriptions close to my personality. Very fun. Delicate and imaginative, not just a description. As deep and non-superficial as the book of men from Mars, the irony is in stance, not in terms. A heavy literature type. I enjoyed it very much
If you want to read this famous writer, do not start with this because it is beautiful and concluding
The idea, in which Al-Qossabi wrote his novel, is beautiful
The truth is not cruel. But escaping ignorance is as painful as giving birth. Run after the truth until you breathe out. Pain in the land until you create yourself again. These meanings need a lifetime to understand. A lifetime of fatigue punctuated by hours of wine
There is nothing wrong . Comfortable and reasonable price. Away from the sanctuary and unknown to the taxi
good. . Bad reception, reception staff and delayed key delivery procedures
A wonderful and beautiful booklet was one of the books that were dedicated to me during the health conditions that I passed through the booklet its content addressed to the soul and the confused spirit to find the way to its salvation by not worrying about what does not worry and not to overburden the soul beyond its energy and in the horizon it cleared of hope that gives light to blind blindness .. A series of lessons in the framework of lessons and reflections that make stumbling in the ways of life a starting point and an illusion of endings a thread of hope for salvation from failure and opening a loophole in a closed wall that sets out for success only by not eating the soul with regret and not being killed by remorse, as long as life has long been written with hope.
Exceptional. Comfort and calm. The lack of variety for breakfast
A long novel by the late writer Ihssan Abdel Quddus in which he records a period of the history of Egypt after the Egyptian revolution in the mid-twentieth century .. An interesting novel and an enjoyable and easy style ... I still read it and did not complete it after my evaluation of it so far.
At home I sit, not happy, not sad. In between. I don&#39;t care if I know that I am. Really I ... or nobody. Maybe it is like us in these. The watches fold its shadow. But he is alone. The person who did not cry this morning ,. He did not see death flying over us like a falcon .... The living are the cousins of death and the dead. Sleepers are calm and quiet. And if I could speak to the Lord I would say: My God, my God, why did you give up on me? I am only a shadow of your shadow on earth. How did you abandon me, and put me in. Question traps: why did you create mosquitoes? My goodness my God?
Excellent. Excellent cleanliness. Excellent staff, very good breakfast. The room door needs maintenance because the electronic lock is not working properly. Bed sheets need a better type.
Egyptian pounds for a clean double room with shared bathroom. Free wifi internet. Overlooking Tahrir Square I stayed for two nights in a room with a shared bathroom in the Sun Hotel. The location couldn&#39;t be better. It is literally a few steps away from the metro entrance to Tahrir Square, so you are just a few blocks away from the Egyptian Museum, the Nile Corniche, and shopping areas in downtown Cairo. If you come using the metro, all you have to do is get off at Sadat Station and you will find that you have arrived. The rooms are comfortable and have mosquito nets, ceiling fan and Wi-Fi internet. There are a large number of bathrooms, all with private bathrooms, all with private hot showers ....... beautiful thing. There is no TV, but there is a TV in the lobby that is constantly viewed by smoking guests. Smoking was not allowed in our room, perhaps it was allowed in other rooms. The reception staff were providing assistance with road guides or advice. The pound may not seem like a cheap amount for two people in a room with a shared bathroom, but this is really the case in this town. If you are looking for a decent room in a hostel at good prices we will definitely recommend Al Shams Hotel.
On the anniversary of the Great Victory, I loved reading a book about the great man, the leader of the country at this time. The book was dictated by President Sadat Ali Akatib, the famous Anis Mansour. And Sadat has another book called Searching for the Self which is also a very wonderful book, these two books together are among the best things you read to learn about the life of Egypt and the life of Sadat in this period .. In this book Sadat tells about his life struggle for Egypt, and tells about the revolution and what Before and after, and he talks about the setback and his relationship with Gamal Abdel Nasser and the free officers .. Then he elaborates on Egypt’s relationship with the Soviet Union, which Sadat described as the humiliating relationship because the Soviets tried to take advantage of Egypt’s weak position to stabilize their feet in the Middle East .. The book is loaded with very important historical and political information and the style of the book is definitely Is it because the writer Anis Mansour and gramophone is Sadat.
As soon as I finished it, I went speeding looking for the computer to write about it and with it, but I stayed for a while looking at the screen with astonishment for an unspecified reason in the beginning. I read a few pages of it and did not like it for several reasons. For the writer’s name, or for the beauty of his papers or its cover, not for its content, I stopped reading it for about a week and stray by my side at the bed and wandered with me in my university bag every day in the hope that I would continue with it. At the end, I decided to return to it, but with less enthusiasm, perhaps for one reason, my library did not contain new books, so it was a kind of compulsion that I fought in. The words of the nobility descended on my heart, like the rain beads from the sky, are light, but strong, enjoyable, they do not contain unnecessary details, a good end between sadness and joy and intermittent amazement. The situation. I am curious to know more. Have you ever accepted to return to it despite all the pain that caused her in her life, I enjoyed it.
Awesome. Excellent and wonderful. Parkin is good but narrow
When the wolves grow old by its writer, Jamal Naji, it is characterized by an interesting narration style that attracts the reader and a narrative technique that adopts a narrative style of multiple narration voices. Connecting them with real people .. The personality of Sheikh Al-Janzeer stands out as an example of someone who is investing bad debt. And the left-leaning Gibran left for power. And it casts the girl as a symbol of seduction in the eyes of males despite the simplicity of her personality. The most prominent hero is Azmi Al-Wajih, who represents the mysterious side of the story .. The novel takes place in the capital, Amman, starting from Jabal Al-Joufah, a popular region to expand the geography of the novel later to extend to Jabal Amman, Luweibdeh and West Amman, shedding light on the social patterns of these areas .. The novel appears boldly to break it The so-called narrative taboos Religion Sex Politics with reservation that many may take on sexual employment within the literary text presented between our hands in the novel .. We discussed the novel in the presence of its writer in a book in December and according to the author&#39;s description, the novel reveals the basic aspects of the city&#39;s society that is hidden On many political, religious, sexual, and social transgressions and practices, while keen to exaggerate the bright aspects in order to hide what is left out
A wonderful, influential and powerful book that carries sad feelings and strong imprisonment, whose effect appears on the reader, the poet, who is passionate, despite the fact that he carries the phenomenon of modern racism for the century. While I was reading the book, I saw that my eyes were tearfully distressed by this weak character, Jesus.
Her description of her mother&#39;s illness experience was almost the most liked in the book. I like it in general
Great experience and great hotel. The staff is very helpful and especially the manager, Mr. Hazem.
Allah the Exalted, the Majestic, says: Rather, a person has his own insight, even if he gave his excuses, no matter what your excuses and justifications are, but you are the most person on the face of the earth that you can read yourself and search inside you and deal with your whims and revelations your high will did not oppress you did not give you a mind smaller than understanding your personal limits ..
I like it very, very much, especially since I am one of the people who try to avoid Facebook, in which it has successful attempts and many failed. He tells you that the true name of Facebook is alone together. For example, if you are on a trip before the appearance of Facebook in the first place, you will listen to the trip and your friends, and in every detail there is possible now after you are there. Originally with the trip, nor with your friends, you are centered on the screen. I described a lot of Elvis I like it as a mirror that masquerades as a window and a vampire. As a matter of fact, it absorbs our time, attention and energy. If Inspector Vis had limited his companions ’term, they would meet him with a question as to why he was absent and his return to real life would be the concept of absence. In addition to the psychological problems caused by Facebook from. . And away from the fact that each one has an electronic folder with such a company, and in it there are already companies that occupy it, that they coordinate each individual&#39;s folder. And Elvis is free because it offers an expensive commodity. I don&#39;t mind that it sells your personal information to anyone, if you are a famous person or you will remain. Frankly, he said all that I want to say about Elvis and that life was more calm and sweeter than others. On a personal experience: I did not actually inspect Elvis for about two months, due to circumstances beyond my control, in the first days of this I was tense, fanatic, and sensitive, that I missed my whole life, and I was living in a different world, far from my companions and acquaintances, after a week passed, I felt that I was calm and I said God life without a beautiful face I went back to most of the needs I love by following a program with Mama or listening to the radio and using the phone. I ask him about my friends who really loved me. With the first meeting I had with my companions, I was enjoying, and I don&#39;t want to go home, I want to spend the longest time with them, and really happened despite it being a period of exams .. there was no need for my annoyance other than the needs of the people I love and I do not have their phone numbers I mean, Elvis is the only way I see The second need is the needs in my studies that I want to know, and I can only reach them via Facebook. At the first opportunity I had, so I could see people who did not know their news except from Elvis. Also, there are normal words that will be said in return for him, who knows how to influence my meeting with the people I wrote face to face, even though the speech is far from disturbing me. During the absence of Facebook, I was meeting with them, and I really felt that they made me crazy, and that there was no need for me to meet them. The bottom line, if there is any way for me to overcome my needs that I am in, so I can cancel it immediately and take the electronic suicide step:
I expected the book to be full of scientific, physical and mental evidence of the existence of God ... How was Mustafa Mahmoud, may God have mercy on him, bound and then believed again ... But I found him listing foolish evidence that they inferred about the absence of God and began to refute it and prove their naivety. Here they are the scholars raving about science, but when they pray for what they cannot explain, they conclude their words with a word of chance ... more than a sentence that attracted my attention that God does not infer the existence of, but inferred the existence of things in the presence of God. I do not remember the sentence with the text, but this is its meaning .... God have mercy on a scientist, thinker and writer Mustafa Mahmoud, who God guided many people
The novel, in its entirety, is good, and was walking in great sequence and new style. But the first thing that entered the entrance of magic and charlatans and the underworld. A novel that took a second course, for myself, I was not loved. The writer, Hosni, said that there is no separation between the knowledge of all of us of love and of myself with his passion for psychology, between magic, sorcery, and the underworld. This is more than something I did not like in the novel but a wonderful writer and I enjoyed the novel and the dust of diamonds and waiting for suspense in
A wonderful work worth reading. I liked the most important way in which the novel takes us from the beginning of the Mamluks for a year, and the thread that connects all of this is the idea of searching for freedom. I was amazed, how did slavery disappear in various forms, including the idea of searching for freedom itself? I enjoyed it very much, and it made me think a lot. Although the novel is long, I read it in two days.
Very good hotel. The price of the hotel is good. The hotel is close to the campus, if you go by bus, but far away if you go to the campus. But there are buses to connect you to the campus for an hour. There is no company coverage at all in the hotel. There are no toiletries such as soap and shampoo in the bathroom
Exceptional. Close to the sanctuary. Magnetic keys do not open the door
A wonderful, simple and comprehensive book that shows the leading role of Abul Fotouh in the Islamic movement. What is important is that I have his village in the strangest place where he can read in the resort Hahaha and his village on one session.
Difficult to comment ..
Gorgeous . All services are excellent and I would recommend staying there.
A biography in a more than wonderful novelistic form that shows you how Taha Hussein conquered the darkness to hurt the dean of Arabic literature
Exceptional. Everything in the hotel is great .. the reception staff are friendly .. the rooms are excellent service .. has its own independence from the shared lifts. Toilets are rather small
A written novel from his age means adding my life many times, but it is an embodiment of reality since ancient times, and it does not change for a moment but rather it has become full of hypocrisy and hypocrisy more than before as if hypocrisy is like oxygen no one can live in that life without hypocrisy the novel this course I did a movie but the movie The injustice of the novel is the injustice between it is the idea to be dealt with, and it is the ethics represented by pills that a person draws without touching on the content, but the question here is if the Sebaei is the one who wrote the novel and he has the right then it turns into a movie that did not convey what came in the novel completely this is a difficult thing for sure because Difficult to embody a page narration in a film that lasted an hour and a half, but There are things that brought the film a far cry from what was narrated, so what was the first to shed light on water that came with the narration, as this is not hypocrisy?
Finally, I concluded it was a really nice novel, but I felt a little bored as I read it, because this is not an excellent translation. However, she remains a great narrator
Villa. Villa facing the seaside: everything is beautiful, especially children&#39;s pools, hygiene, cafe, honey, and breakfast was wonderful and the variety of staff was smiling at all times. The private pool can be closed to increase the privacy in it. I will repeat this experience in the coming year. The means of transportation ticked was a little late, especially in the morning to go to breakfast
The hotel is very cool. . nothing
good. This hotel is a very magnificent family hotel. Why Mooyah ten riyals
I enjoyed with my family and told the family about the amazing place. The place is great for families, especially the indoor women’s pool, offering restaurants and sea views. Insufficient number of car services
Star. There is no breakfast on the menu, but I recommend it to every traveler who wants calm and tranquility in Al Khobar and the proximity of malls like Al Rashid and Dhahran Mall, among others. I wish there was a breakfast at the same cost of rent
Wonderful and enjoyable Wonderful and enjoyable hotel characterized by calm and cleanliness and a feeling of security and complete comfort in it, and the efficiency of all workers in it is high, being a family we would have preferred to make lunch within the costs of accommodation rather than breakfast or provide lunch at a reasonable cost commensurate with the family members.
Good service. Please review the reservation papers for non-smokers, and thank you very much. There is something
very comfortable . The decor is very beautiful.
While I was reading, I never thought that you are an artist. Returning to Haifa, a pain of a homeland. Five stars are due.
Good and quiet. Suhoor in Ramadan was not good, the items were over four, the pool was not clean, and the lighting was weak. Location and calm
Very excellent and classy service. Cleanliness, calm service, staff, service in general. the Internet is very bad
good. Hotel does not have a beach. A major flaw.
Congratulations
Beautiful, quiet and elegant place. Everything is good, beautiful and classy. My arrival was late on registration and when I asked them for some time at checkout they refused to give me more than half an hour and this is their right, but I wished that they would help me with that, especially since he was performing a late flight
Wonderful. Tranquility and cleanliness The location, service and handling are excellent.
Comfortable and family hotel. comfortable place. Unavailability of taxis
Abu Dhabi . I liked everything.
The first note about the novel is that it captures you from the first to the other. Hours I would just want to content myself with what I read and closed, so that they could see other needs, but I was not as much. The novel is really charming. And you live the details of Andalusia and occupy it in the smallest details. The first time read about the fall of Andalusia the way de. I just have one note. I think anyone reading a hundred years of isolation will notice that there is a terrible similarity between the two versions. How to deal with characters and passage from one character to another, and deal with the death of the characters of the novel. Almost until the same period. The events of the novel took nearly a year. At first, I thought the similarity was a coincidence. But when the similarities were met with so much, I ruled out the chance and thought that Radwa Ashour was intending to do something like a hundred years of isolation. Frankly, I do not know this is sweet or not? We can consider that she appreciated the need to do as great and valuable the Marquise business if that was a good thing. We can consider that the element of imitation is not a good need. I am confused personally. But in the end, it remains that this novel enjoyed me to the max and deserved the stars well
good. I liked the hotel manager Bawazir Khalq and hospitable. The location of the hotel and breakfast are very unassuming and breakfast
The hotel is good. everything is OK. the hotel
Of the most beautiful, easiest and greatest of what I read. I read it more than once. He touches one of his faces ..... a genius booklet
A wonderful novel with its meanings and feelings. Even in describing political and social life in Tehran. A new experience to understand a lot about Iranian society and its suffering in light of the Iranian revolution and before. Names and intention changed one. But when religion is mixed, fading is worse and its effect is more informed and more accurate.
Many of their goodness on hospitality .. and my words are unable to thank. Cleanliness / interest / very sophisticated / very excellent location / good reception and excellent handling above .. very safe .. fast services .. and I thank all those in charge of it from cooperative groups and to establish soon, God willing.
I liked it. I didn&#39;t know anything about dancing the angels before I posted Fayrouz. I am now fine ... blessed with comfort ... because I am now a corpse. Most of what I wanted was one day. Mercy of my contradictions in me. Nothing looks like me. I wrote this .. in BC. I haven&#39;t lost anything ... the warmth is still in my soul. . Where is Rome for God’s sake ... as long as all the roads lead to it? . He fought for me a little bit. And Kazem spreads a special warmth next to me ... I waved the painful memory of my life. A butterfly I came threw my wings solution. You have. My wings were unjustly burned. You are not the only one who resembles me to this extent ... I also resemble me very clearly
Nice idea, thin and distinctive. It brings you back to the innocence and imagination of children wide:
Good on the sea, not for foreigners. Everything was good. I am looking for a great location and location for me on the sea, but it is not suitable for the Gulf and conservative families in general because it is on the beach and everyone saw the swimwear. The restaurant did not ask him for all requests from the external restaurants. All the employees were nice and helpful. Thanks everyone. Wi-Fi is not free
This book is a natural psychological epic close to the nature of the female .. The loss is the most difficult and the most bitter of feelings at all. As for the deceased is the son and the tragedy is death, and behind this love there is a great sense of guilt, powerlessness, emotional emptiness and a solid life without any excitement. Or even softness, here writing is nothing but a severe bleeding of memory .... Frankly for the first time I read a novel belonging to a Gulf novelist I do not insult in his letters grumbling about the life of reservation imposed on the Gulf .... And if the opinion of some is a novel that leads to depression and Its shipments are distributed in space .. So the one who forgives the novelist is that after she sailed to the reader in the world So, after I sincerely bothered him with the size of her grief and sadness, I wrapped him with a page number that somehow orchestrated the chanting of a happy song and broadcast it in the air .... It was a wonderful novel.
Wonderful, and I will repeat the experience, God willing. Location, tranquility, cleanliness, decoration, reception, suhoor, ironing room. nothing
A super cool book. I learned a lot from him very much. I hope to God that Islam can be cherished in Japan
It was a pleasant stay. The hotel is good and we add friendly and respectful staff, including reception and very helpful. There is a very good massage center and there are three places for entertainment, Filipino and Arabic and I think Russian. Next to the hotel there are no services like a supermarket located far away, but it can be reached by walking the pharmacy far away. There is only one restaurant near the hotel
With this heart first to fail. It is in the depths of love that they burn. What I waste the day that passed by me. Without falling in love and being in love
This book should be taught in schools and kept in memory forever
The pros and cons of the hotel. The staff is very clean. The club is very clean. The restaurant is very clean. The restaurant is more than wonderful. The distance from Sheikh Zayed Road, which provides all kinds of entertainment
Elif Shafak. I was able to live among nations. Outwardly different cultures and personalities. With the ability to show similarities within people. . I saw the effect of the past on the present
Exceptional. The location is very nice and strategic, and the view of the fountain and the tower is a plus. The place lacked an external relationship to suspend things
An interesting and light book dominated by the humorous and satirical writer style, but I do not agree with the writer on some matters. I loved his honesty and principles. As for his aggressive thinking of people, he was often illogical.
This sarcastic writer. He knows how to throw his words and gets hurt. Jitters. I have always been different with your pen .. Thank you
The secret of our tragedy. Our screams are bigger than ours. Our sword is taller than our stature
Exceptional. The site is characterized by complete comfort, tranquility and quietness. Thank you, Pearl. The roads never liked me, as there were changes during my stay in the hotel.
Exceptional. The reception was excellent, especially Youssef and Aref. Their treatment was excellent and excellent.
One reading can not pass it, and perhaps reading will not pass it without discussion .. An internal revolution will take place among those who understand it and without a doubt ... a rich encyclopedic philosophical ... travel.
A truly fascinating novel that reflects the reality in the shadow of authoritarian totalitarianism and focuses on black political comedies. A novel worthy of a well-deserved full evaluation by the giant English writer George Orwell.
What a pleasure to give a book five stars and your conscience relieved. How sweet is to live a sincere romantic situation under the auspices of the Romantic Ambassador and her philosopher. The book is a letter filled with a passionate desire and formulated with the best rhetorical images, and this is something expected when the two parties are Al-Rafii, Mai Ziadeh or Marie Ziadeh .. Syrian Christianity with Lebanese origins in relation to her father and Palestinian origins in relation to her mother. And she is a wonderful writer on the Arab level, and she was and still is a model for the free Arab woman who has an audible voice and good opinion .. Some sources mention that she has many lovers, including Al-Rafii, but the most prominent of them is Gibran Khalil Gibran, and she is the only one who declared her love after a year of their relationship. On my opinion of the book:. A love from a third party. This was my feeling, it is very strange that you look at the messages of lovers. It is more surprising that you learn from them how to formulate the meanings that your heart does not conjure up and cannot formulate your pen .. It means my country like this ... One who loves one and I in the spirit of sitting with them like this:. I think the Al-Rafei School in romance is one of its features, innovation and distance from the beaten and common words of lovers lying in a sincere style and feelings of the lunar light .. His creativity is not only prose but sets your eyes on places of poetry what is the most beautiful and the most beautiful and sweetest. In the shadow of the distorted love and the indulgence in describing the charms, wading and studying in it, this book came to restore the joy of the classic love and the feelings swinging between ebb and flow ... between Akouf and Azouf ... between eagerness and separation .. it is a essence in itself and a very enriching reference for young researchers looking Refine their language and feelings .. Note: There is a download link included with the book introduction. And now I leave you with some quotes to elite me too. Interesting reading, God willing
I recommend it. A distinguished hotel and close to the Grand Mosque. The price is exaggerated, the parking is not available, knowing that they have it, so I had to go to the KDE parking spaces to park my car
A pleasant and comfortable stay thanks to your excellent services. Breakfast is beautiful, varied and delicious and thanks for that. Everything in the hotel is great
Quiet, great hotel, suitable for newlyweds. Calm, cleanliness and everything. Internet service is very expensive, preferably free
Delightful imagination, illusion and pain
Mostly, the hero, whose entire life is clouded and darkened, does not become the hero, but for some reason I liked the novel. A novel worth reading.
Very beautiful, because this novel contains sincere feelings, sadness, longing for the loss of farewell, a love of happiness, with which many feelings and situations that pass by us all liked me, but it is not on the level of the bamboo leg. But it&#39;s amazing from the masterpieces of this wonderful writer:
It has to be read again
The genius of this zoskind:
Exceptional. The frankness of the hotel is more than excellent, cleanliness, highly comfortable, and I advise everyone to sit in this hotel.
God willing, it was an encyclopedia
There is nothing wrong with me, but I consider it to be more educational than literary .. Beautiful advice in the book, even though I exceeded many of its pages and stopped at the titles of attention only .. But it is considered beautiful in general, especially the chapter called this rabbit escapes
Professor Qandil, a tall figure and rich experience. First of all, we thank you, Professor Kandil, for giving us the opportunity of this book to read and benefit from the experience. Secondly, we call you always for health and wellness. Thank you so much
I was excited about it once, and I enjoyed the novel in a way, to the extent that this book was the first book I ever had without what I have left when I end up in love so much because he let me know I have been with his grace and he has lived in people suffering and suffering ... Praise be to God, thank you.
Exceptional. . TV size and some channels are blurred
Exceptional. The location is close to the malls and restaurants, it provides free parking, high-end dealing with employees, cleanliness, Wi-Fi availability, rooms, hall, and spacious bathrooms. There is no
More than a wonderful novel about diamond dust and Vertigo. Simply a narration:
I finished reading the novel &quot;Butterfly&#39;s Book&quot; by the talented writer, Sherine Sami. Which I think is a wonderful literary energy and talent that has not yet been discovered, although this is normal in the first novel, and I am confident that the next work will achieve a much greater resonance after Sherine made a balance of confidence in the taste of everyone who read the work, and mobilized an audience waiting for her new creativity ... Language: attractive and coherent, indicating a writer who was a good reader in the first place, not from that prevalent style that decided to write just because he had read a work or two, as the writer seemed to be influenced by the Naguib Mahfouz School in caring for the narration and detailed description, and the use of the smooth dialogue language Simple, closest to colloquial in dialogue .. Characters: Each character has its own language A, her style, and her way of speaking, which confirms that the writer made for each character a file with all the details about her before proceeding to write, so that she does not fall into the trap of mixing between the way she talks and the way the characters speak in which many authors fall, especially in their first works ... plot Coherent and interconnected. Rhythm: The rhythm could have been more vibrant and active in short some marginal matters and not digressing in them, but there is nothing wrong, because the current rhythm is acceptable and not slow in a very moving way. Cover: One of the most beautiful and coolest covers I have seen in the past three years, and has a magical ability to stick to memory and stick to it no matter how the eye sees after it other covers, as well as its complete suitability to work in a way that makes it difficult to imagine a cover other ... I liked high heroine to work to the extent The disease is with her, because she is the human being that she loved and was not associated with, and she lost and lost with another person, and she is the sister that her older brother did not feel and she strayed, and she is every girl who was a project for a successful and successful human being, but the good intentions were not enough to make those dreams come true, and I wished that she had found them before they were lost To protect her and I hope others do that before it is too late ... What did not satisfy me at work is that, like most Arab women&#39;s literature, despite my reservation to this classification, it often focuses on the pain of the oppressed female victim, but the truth is said that the restriction of the butterfly succeeded in attracting me to its world and forced me to abandon this distress from that problem without paying attention except me and me On the last page, I think Sherine Sami will be smart enough to get out of this cocoon in her new work to navigate other worlds, just as her dear Sherine Hinai succeeded in getting rid of that syndrome. The evaluation of five and awaiting the new work, God willing, for the name will have a big affair in the near future, God willing
Clean and excellent location. The reception staff welcomed the speedy registration and departure. Although the size of the room is m, the way the room is divided makes it appear larger ... The presence of a water sprinkler beside the toilet diminishes God sakes you.
Comfortable stay at a satisfactory price. On-site room processing price. Actually, nothing
I benefited a lot from this novel from knowing the political, social and religious atmosphere before ... and I was more impressed with the style of its writing where the characters are arranged without specific logic and at the same time it is clear that a good planning had taken place before proceeding to write ... I, like Ahmed, were simplified
good. . The location of the hotel is on a busy street, Madinah Road
While touring the library, the title of the book caught my eye as a papa, and immediately I remembered something from my childhood, and how my father rebuked me if I played in the mud in the living neighborhood ... In the following, a defect, like a papa, you want me to congratulate you. Where did these phrases come from? . I hope that this book is present in every Arab home ... just read it ... and look at yourselves and your customs in dealing with people ... what would you change ???
A wonderful book, as simple as its idea, but it is considered a simple Sufi philosophical book
The first time I ended it, I asked myself whether it was war, who turned us into people without emotion and mercy, or that this is our reality and we are awaiting the conditions that allow us to remove the mask of kindness and mercy. What is the cruelest war and what it is capable of transforming us into selfish and exploitative monsters
. The location and the cleanliness are close to restaurants and services. Internet suffers from interruption and very slow and is not recommended to use prepaid
The book is wonderful and its idea is great, but it is not accurate in all its information, without changing or biasing to the general idea of the book. But not all people will accept the book with open hearts.
Very beautiful and very interesting, and I preferred, to some extent, the last one. But my personal opinion is that if in fact it remains a mistake.
A novel that makes you fear its end due to the severity of its fascination with its events and personalities, you feel that you lost a dear friend when you finished it; just as it forces you to devour its pages one by one to learn about the upcoming events;
A very beautiful book
I liked the book and I think we underestimate the book its right if we compare it to other books .. The mind of Ghada Al-Samman is frightening and suspicious in a mysterious way from my point of view .. which made me more determined to walk in the corridors of her mind despite a little bit of the first part ... You will not swim in a lake Satan .. you will swim in the lakes of your mind you .. dark lakes .. unknown lakes .. and in your swimming bag your fears and desires ... a book worth reading only for readers who are ready to break the box that their minds have always been trapped in since eternity ..
Losing a lot Elly Makrash Diwan da. Any words can not express the splendor of the sons
Fayek Level Hotel. Provides amazing services in everything. There was no card in the room that I put in to clean the room
Very good . Their service is excellent and the location is close to the campus. High value for room alone only
Nice and worth the experience. Frankly, the hotel deserves a better location than its current location. I just think that the air conditioner needs a little maintenance before entering the heat and humidity ,,
Beautiful sweet beauty
The first book I read fully after the Noble Qur’an is a realistic account of the Iraqi resistance toward the American occupation
I want to feel beautiful feelings, I want a need for the spirit of your soul to be read. I read Nour Abdel-Majid diligently so I am every novel that fascinates me about what was before it and I remain in front of me. When I saved her, she was disturbed by dreams, and she was saddened by it. I loved Jabr Away and respected it. I hated Nahed Away, and it made me difficult and cried, and I loved Mary so hard. And my writer, who plays p Z Uttar my heart and emotions ..dmte creative and radiant always though it was Aktar than ten stars I Adatha hard ..
A jewel ... linguistically rich ... interesting ... and a unique style of narration ... after I read it the first time I read it back to enjoy the eloquence of expression
The location is excellent, the room is spacious, the furniture is excellent, the bathroom is complete and all services are very close to the hotel and parking. everything. nothing
good. Cleanliness and location of the hotel. The number of elevators compared to the size of the hotel is few and this causes congestion and takes a long time
good. Bus service for the campus every quarter of an hour, for the hotel for free.
good. The reception staff treat them excellent and the price is very excellent.
I am talking about the Rakah branch from very adamaaaaaaaaaaaaan, it is delicious, clean, and its price is reasonable, but its only flaw is sometimes it puts a rocky employee, I mean, good.
Certainly, I am not strong enough for a young man. I just liked it. I liked it. A strong message from another person.
Comfortable, quiet and available services. I liked the calmness and cleanliness, its proximity to some restaurants, groceries, City Center Deira, the capacity of the rooms, there are four bathrooms, and a room for the maid. I liked the privacy, and it is suitable for conservative families. I did not ask to fill the fridge, and I used to go out in the morning and allow them to clean. Every time they put in the fridge drinks, chibi, and water, and I don’t know, and my children eat them, and I did not ask them to bring these things because the prices are very high. They said the price of chips, juice, and water, and I originally do not know that they are attending these supposed things. They ask the guest, do you want or not?
Zamzam and elite is the best frank. The staff are excellent treated, the location and restaurant are lonely. The room smells very bad, especially the first time you enter
A book that added to me a lot of information about the Islamic religion and the miracle of the Qur’an in addition to the difference in other religions and previous civilizations. Very interesting presentation and fun style. I liked it a lot and I advise everyone to read it.
Gibran, as always, addresses the soul. They say that stupidity is the cradle of eternity, and that eternity is a resting place ... It may be true for those who are born dead and live like cold dead bodies on the soil. If one does not conceive of gloom and despair leads to love and affliction puts him in the cradle of dreams, his life remains like a blank page in the book of entity
God will burn you, Youssef Ya Sebae .... Our Lord, have mercy on you, and forgive you for what you are
Wonderful. The room decor is beautiful and the bed is very comfortable.
Fun and enjoyable, like any story written by Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq.
Wonderful and pure sound ... suitable for the fans of the German national team
Exceptional. Tranquility and cleanliness The location is excellent and very close to Mall of the Emirates. Entrance to the hotel is not easy to get a taxi quickly. The pool was closed for maintenance without notice
The book is very useful, or discusses many needs in our reality, in the opinion of the quality of these books that should be applied in schools. I advise everyone to read the book.
Men in the sun .. It is the missing legitimate cry, it is the Palestinian voice that has long been lost in the tents of displacement ...
wonderful . Every alum. nothing
I am in screen .. of words and details ... an interesting novel .. an impact .. a storm .. a biting .. elegant .. fancy in its beginning .. realistic at the end of it ... the writer&#39;s words about. Love, men, women, writing, homeland, Arabism, music and marriage are like morphine. When pain is a beautiful drug ... In December, dreams come to an end
Really exceptional novel. At first glance, you think it is the story of Noah, then you discover that it is your story. You may be the hero too. The narrator brought too many contemporary problems in an easy and fun style. Horizon and Nawras The most beautiful duo I wished to be the third of them. I loved the symbols in the whole story, I loved the fact that he did not describe the characters, not even in a specific name, and he was satisfied with his insignificance, ruggedness, Abdel Mal, Arha and others. So be suitable for anytime, anywhere. The most important negative is its moral weakness, but it is worth reading:. Quotes:. If we board a ship, we should not expect to go anywhere other than what they mean ...
Read it away from the helis written in textbooks:. Very delicious
Gorgeous . Everything is excellent and most especially thanks to the receptionist / Susan. nothing
A more than wonderful book that sets rules for students of that sensitive period in the history of Islamic civilization and balances between the status of the Companions, advising their preferred companions to the Holy Prophet, p. Or you get infected ..
good. The service is fast, the reception is good deal. Bedding is expendable and the pillows are also uncomfortable and towels
A very beautiful book ... The style of Manfaluti is sophisticated and literally strong ... A book that tells sad stories .. Shred in writing and conveyed by the narrator, and convey the sad image in it with amazing accuracy
A wonderful and comprehensive book that presents the most important currents and groups that contributed to the formation of Islamic thought throughout the ages in an easy language and a brief picture, while not neglecting the political, social and legal aspects that accompanied the emergence of each group or current
Ahlam has a wonderful ability to tell the events of her heroes in a sad language and words that have magic, and to combine love, war, death and assassinations with literary quotes.
Very nice hotel. One of the best hotels that I lived in Dubai, knowing that it is not the first time that I live in the hotel, and the hotel will always be my destination in Dubai, especially the excellent reception staff, two events, headed by Professor Sharif Al-Masry. nothing
Very nice hotel and I advise you. . Wi-Fi ,,, and the price of meals
Inspiration, motivation, positive life, and optimistic vision
In this book, I found myself, and for the first time I write a lot of quotes and stand for the stories reflecting .. a book worth reading
Luxurious. Repeat, by all accounts, the reception is more than wonderful, especially Omar. nothing
My brother, Professor Ahmed, greet your pen, which was written and creative, and he said, I summarize, and talk and persuade .. One of the few times in my life that I am sure that every letter in a book has influenced a direct impact, so adrenaline came at the heart of my lapes and gave him the instant signal To believe in what is in my heart and persist in it, and that the path I walk on is paved for one goal: change .. follow
good. The interview is good, the room cleanliness is excellent and attention is paid by the cleaning worker. Special attention is paid to the comfort of the guests, and the attention of the receptionist. Special thanks to him for the attention.
The price is very favorable. The price is very excellent and adequate. The hotel restaurant is very excellent. Costa Coffee is available in the lobby hour. The crew is excellent .. I told them that I was two hours late to check out, at noon, at noon. The employee assured me of the matter and said salvation. But they knocked our backs and knocked us back.
An influential book .. On his pages, Ali Al-Dhafeeri spreads some of what stuck to his spirit from the earliest ages until the hour of nationalities and Arabism and all those storms from the eighties until the hour. Al-Dhafiri talks about himself in a biography in this book, but it contains the summary of the revolutions that erupted in the Arab world. A book I found very beautiful..Thank him
I do not forget what Renan said about Jamal Al-Din Al-Afghani that he reminds him of great atheists like Ibn Rushd just because they worked their minds in religious texts called them atheism and this book explains the importance of reason and thinking in our religion and that the failure of the mind to perform his job is the eye of atheism is not evidence of the importance The reason in the Sharia is that it is the duty of the mandate, and if he is absent, the assignment is lost
Exceptional. The reception is excellent by employee Christina and follow-up after receiving the apartment, almost all the attachments in the kitchen are present, I recommend the visit ..
Nobody writes the same .. no one starts like him .. and no one finishes it. Alone, the confines of the end .. He is the end of his own novels
The novel fascinated me from all aspects and the style of Abdul Hakim Qasim is more than wonderful and the story is excellent, but it was the sunrise edition that did not revolve my luck and its price as well. Of course, every week I buy books and novels for more than a pound, but I do not accept their provocation. Back to the seven days of man ... four and a half stars ... and the other half was lost because of the end you expected twenty pages before the end
. It is war, Father. Respect for the human spirit becomes a kind of hypocrisy. . A world war, a platoon of Nazis, ghosts walking at night, and my beloved being black. Maliha Halba This story is good information as well as an open end.
You can say about this book that it is a friend. Fun to the fullest, you won&#39;t be disturbed by the café music, which has always complained that it doesn&#39;t fit in, but people will bother you when they interrupt you.
good. Nice view, outdoor seating and swimming pools, good location. The floor of the room and the furniture. We asked for dinner with rice, chicken and grape edam, and the rice was bad and the rest of the food was acceptable.
I liked very much
A nice and beautiful book in which Ibn Hazm talks about love, and he excelled in his description and description of its meanings and symptoms. Each section in this book makes you feel that you are moving from one garden to another for the skill of his description .. I liked that Ibn Hazm concluded his book with the door of ugliness of disobedience and the virtue of being relaxed, in which he talked about the ugliness of fornication, The sweetness of love while abstaining from disobedience to God and the great reward from God Almighty.
Exceptional. Very frankly, frankly. nothing
Embody the true meaning of the revolution
Perfect service and beauty. The first thing that amazes you when you enter is the smiling faces of the Taj Hotel staff ... a wonderful atmosphere when checking in ... Chocolate is given to children, and with great generosity they gave my son a mixture of chocolate as a welcome, but they sent us the three of us .. even though breakfast It wasn&#39;t included in the show, but they did it on a shared basis. The room was located on the fifth floor, which had great views of the Presidents Building and Parliament Building. The rooms are beautiful, but a bit old, as the TVs are old and there are no LCD screens .. but they are nonetheless very nice ... The bathrooms are quite small. The best of all was the quietness of this hotel despite being in the city center near the India Gate .. The pool is great .. The coach there is very nice .. We had dinner in the Chinese restaurant and the service was fine .. They gave my son a free drink, Chocolate and a distinctive Chinese dish for free ... and the wine was very good .. Breakfast was wonderful with beautiful dishes from South India and a lot of juices, mixed drinks, and a choice of miles with a selection of beautiful bread .. In general we felt welcome at this hotel and the people in the hotel They make it better ...
Beautiful and modern hotel. The hotel is very beautiful and modern, located next to the shopping center and the price is great. nothing
Wonderful. To be honest, I booked this hotel two years ago and its problems are changing. In terms of cleanliness and arrangement .. The location is in Aziziyah by the side of the pick and in the side of the hotel there is a barber and a private hospital and a grocery store and the same item is located and a kilo of Raghadan restaurant for rice and food we find I mean the site is very beautiful and has parking and reception were understood because I booked Suite two days and two rooms a day and extended to me suite for the last day. What I liked is after him from the sanctuary, I mean, you are looking from the hotel for the campus. You meet the types of prices, and you do not have a problem, but after praying Tarawih and you are returning from the sanctuary to the hotel, there is a clear exploitation that means less than a riyal and a domain to connect to the riyal. This is the only disadvantage.
A very beautiful novel. The political side regarding his visit to Chicago is almost unearthed. Just a great novel, hard working
Thank you for a pleasant stay. Yes the breakfast is good and the bed is comfortable. Check-in
I see that all intelligence was in the way of telling the story and dividing it into characters that are not related to each other, other than the human dimensions. The element of suspense was present until the end of the novel, which loved me in it, but the content and the stages may be considered a philosophical view of love, and this is a sufficient topic that it enriches any fictional work with great work. Thank you Muhammad Sadiq
Recreation. Villa location and pool villa.
From . The place is great. The hotel has a unique clean load. nothing
Exceptional. . The lack of free Wi-Fi
very good. The location of the hotel. The room is very small
good. . Internet service for a financial fee, and this is a big negative for the reputation of this hotel. Less than a place for furnished apartments. The internet is free.
A strange set of contrasting feelings, feelings, and thoughts in the same person. How the public is affected by religious belief and its inclusion in politics to ensure control of the inattentive masses. But the falsity of all this religious constructive nonsense is eventually revealed, and it shows how short-sighted the leaders who flirt with peoples ’beliefs.
All I can say is that I will waive my right to read an interesting novel, discreet writing, a strong narrative plot, a prose style and a solid rhetoric in order to support every stone thrown into stagnant waters to rid us of the germs that have accumulated on them .. Each pen tries to reveal the reality of the oppressed and oppressed Arab woman. With him until the end .. A novel like this tries with the available capabilities for writing to deliver a message and a picture about Arab women in general and Saudi Arabia in particular, deprived of rights, subjugated freedom. Limited powers are prohibited from being a complete human being and the will deserves to be encouraged and stand beside her and support her in communicating the oppressed woman&#39;s voice. To ask where the woman is .. her location .. her role .. her influence .. her work .. her contributions .. her thought .. her platforms .. ??? Issues such as this should not pass and must be stopped at length and try to find a solution and a comprehensive view of it .. In addition to the religious police and what is known as the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which often includes repentant disobedience practicing the role of reform and they need people to fix their minds and souls .. This body is escaped. Iqal, which dominated the necks of people and practiced a religious dictatorship that was protected by a great beard, thought that after God the powers and powers controlled the movements and the dwellings of everyone who had their eyes on him .. And the woman has the lion&#39;s share of their domination even as the solution of her eyes is not safe from them .. you are forbidden from every movement and every book And every idea and every action and everything does not agree with rules They are they even eradicated the privacy and individuality of the human being as a human being and restricted freedoms and narrowed what God can afford ... Content such as this creates an atmosphere of encouragement for other pens able to ring the bell again in a way and put the most beautiful and deepest and most accurate we stand with him and support him and we wish him growth and development towards the best to deliver The message in a clearer, more acceptable and influential.
The story and the idea. Language and style. In all, the book represents an enjoyable journey of suspense, excitement and ideas ... I loved it
A wonderful stay, the Raffles Suites feature a wonderful view of the Kaaba .. The hotel is very clean and its professional staff work with guests. I recommend it to those who wish to rest and relax in Mecca. I have stayed at the hotel many times, and I like the consistency and continuity of service and the continuous high quality of staff and workers alike.
Quiet place, the warm welcome and the address of this place. Good reception, handling, quiet place, breakfast buffet. Fruits are few in proportion to the population and cause you a delay in prayer times, the high price compared to the features available in the room, the menu of eating in the rooms is not available most of it
And Tariq Habib asks him: What are your most closely related books to your true personality? Naguib says to him simply: Mirrors .. ... are mirrors reflecting the same Mahfouz and his opinions and beliefs, spreading it on the tongues, fate and actions of several personalities .. mixed reality with imagination .. and truth with illusion ... ..
The book is great and added a lot to me, and I have opened the door to great knowledge in this field
This book is terribly enjoyable to the point that when I read it to the middle of the college, one of the companions borrowed it from me each one in the role and the book took months. I did not even hold my hand so that I had to download an electronic copy so I read it again, I mean X. The book talks about the youth’s view of girls and all the words are real
Benefits are nice, but if you have children in the hall. The ground room overlooks the pool directly.
I miss you, uncle Jalal, by God
It is a tragedy, and not just a tragedy ... Blessed is the one who promoted his heart and saw his insight ... and may God have mercy on him from the blinds of insights and those with hearts
good. All the hotel staff are great except for the bad Asian receptionist. Organize the way you receive your first suspicion and doubt now
Nice . The hotel is very quiet and this is the most beautiful thing. The room was not facing the pool and did not look down on it
Abu Fahr Allama, the writer and investigator. The third book that I read to him after the letter and the book of Al-Mutanabbi, so you see it being creative in its words, organized and published.
Beautiful and very comfortable. Calm, non-disturbing and hygiene.
The location of the hotel is great. Beautiful and quiet free internet.
The first time I knew, I mean, what is the quadruple..and I remained with the most important quadrupeds very, very:
I do not read novels .... except that I stood on this narration to learn about an important historical era ... the period after the fall of Granada. The novel is written in high Arabic. The book in one sentence .. Creativity enveloped in pain
Comfortable and quiet hotel with quiet location and easy access to campus by bus. These buses are provided by the hotel to transport visitors to the campus around the clock. The hotel is flawed with the availability of services outside due to its location, but this gives it the calm that some visitors prefer.
Calm . Quiet and very isolated room, do not hear the inconvenience of cars on the street and the presence of a number of services near the site .. I go out in the morning and come back late at night, so there was no opportunity for trial and evaluation.
A very special and comfortable place. The reception is very special, the service is great, and the room services are special, especially the minibar, coffee maker, and tea items. nothing
very good. The quality of the furniture in the room is appropriate for the value I took tonight in SR. Adherence to the schedule. Bus trips to and from the campus. The lobby of the hotel lobby can be better than the current one. Payment by bank card was not working then it was fixed later.
What is in this book may be a start for those who do not know, and a door for those who feel and lock for those who want to be overlooked.
A wonderful book in every sense of the word .. tells a unique story. Sometimes you think it&#39;s a fantasy .. worth reading and I really enjoyed reading it ..
Exceptional. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Parking
A distinguished experience was a beautiful romantic experience because it was a celebration of my husband&#39;s birthday, a table was arranged specifically for us and also surprised us when we arrived with the beauty of the roses and candles that were arranged for us, the food was very good and the service was excellent, it was a very beautiful and distinct experience
Integrated hotel. The quadruple room is very spacious, near the campus, good reception, and varied breakfast. I wish it was an hour to leave the hotel at half past three
A beautiful and interesting book, the first book I read of Muhammad Fathi and I liked it, his style like Omar Taher, actually brought Zaytuna:
The hotel is beautiful and the most beautiful crew, especially Professor George. The hotel is very beautiful and the most beautiful crew, especially Professor George. Honestly, we would love to stay at the hotel again, and God will never fail. May God give him wellness. Everything is beautiful
Everything I loved and everything I lost was here one day. And now I reach absence, and everyone is gone
Very exciting .. Frankly, had it not been for the pressure of work and work, I would have saved it in a day .... But there is a question hovering inside this book. Are story events on the ground? Names suggest that the subject is yes. His madness and hallucinations in his book liked me ... but the truth is, I do not classify this book as a novel ... I think it is only an account of the diaries of a man in the apparatus only. Very interesting. I recommend reading it .. For those interested in Saudi novels and Saudi reality:
Wonderful but. Quiet location, cleanliness. I am chosen, the room will be overlooking the city, and when I came to the Egyptian brother, I said there is nothing, and when one came wrong with him and gave him a room, I did not look at the same as my story, he said, preach in it, and this has become before me, so I was ashamed and was silent because I had problems .. a delay in reading the bags to the room where I sat a quarter of an hour at The car waited for the poor worker, because there is only one worker who comes up and goes off the full bag, so sometimes separates the Internet, exaggerating the buffet value at lunch or dinner, where my wife and I just dined, and the amount came to the value. The value for the room is exaggerated, the delay in going out on the pretext that the Arab worker went to lunch
good. The price of the rooms is very favorable, the location of the hotel is close to services. Visitors do not enter
Great hotel. Everything in the hotel is excellent and frankly, and I repeat the visit, but it is very difficult.
Business traveler The location was excellent, and close to Sharaf DG station by foot. As for the rooms, they were quiet and comfortable, and the breakfast is good and varied. The only negative was the fact that the reception was not at the required level, when logged in they told me that the pool hours were at night and I was surprised that they closed at night.
I loved it. I liked it, the refinement of the pen, and I loved the journey that would free the spirit of this boy from illusions that weighed on his days and made him always waiting for the white rabbit who would lead him to the land of dreams .. Kuwait. Through his experience, he discovered a new dimension of what he considered a curse, which is his Filipino root .. This is what made him escape from the deadly Tarouf network. I enjoyed a lot in the last chapters of the novel when he decided to record his affiliation with Kuwaiti society by writing about him by writing about the restrictions he had created for himself himself, as is the case for all nations and societies that create chaotic self-chains and chains. ... And one of the reasons I admire the adult in the bamboo leg also is that the happy endings have always fascinated me:. The leg of the amazing bamboo. I recommend reading it.
good. Good and excellent handling from the crew and close to the airport for those who have a flight or continue. Nothing, praise be to God
The book is excellent, simple, and light, and it does not take you a long time to read it .. For me, the book is more like an excitement to see the biographies of the people who were touched upon in the book
On the margins of the novel. One of the most beautiful things I read and the most beautiful things I will read. Aisha personal takes everything in it to the darkness and light of the world. With all the tragedy, flight, joy and pure love it went through. The tragic rape incident was more beautiful than documented and presented by Muhammad al-Mansi Qandil. Western mainland in all secrets. Pete Wesh Al-Baraka in all its purity despite its impurity. A prophetic woman who saw the affair added many meanings to the novel. Mokhtar Hekaya added a lot and a lot to the novel, despite its small but central role. Howard the wonderful owner of secrets. A novel that marks a great era in important history. Easy and interesting presentation. It really takes you through history. Mohamed Al-Mansi is a creative lamp that can take you from east to west without ever getting distracted. His pen is very cool and deserves respect. It deserves to be cut out of your time to water the masterpieces. The novel is great. A page of suspense, non-boring events and featured shows. A page of depression, joy, history, catastrophes and secrets. A novel that will add to you more than you expect
Wonderful and clean. everything. The Internet is not free
He is the best . Everything was amazing and the service was the best. Our delay from an employee at the reception, even though I am forbidden, and there is no pressure considered as an individual mistake .. I wish there were employees who would take the car from the main gate to the parking spaces ..
The burger of grilled meat is dangerous and does not resist, but they have a problem. Notice that the restaurant is old and there is not much interest in decoration, lighting and sessions.
A very beautiful trip. The reception is excellent and the breakfast is excellent. nothing
This is a book against the narrow, exclusive, puritan and simplistic concept that reduces the full identity to a single affiliation advocated angrily. Against the widespread, very malicious and very dangerous way of thinking that diminishes identity because it puts men in a prejudiced, sectarian, fanatic, authoritarian, and sometimes suicidal position and turns them often into killers or supporters of murderers. Amin Maalouf calls instead to imagine our identity as being made up of multiple affiliations so once we see in ourselves and in our origins various, accurate, and contradictory intersections, contributions, hybrids and influences until we have a different relationship with others. Amin Maalouf believes that we often exaggerate the impact of religions on peoples, while neglecting the opposite of the influence of peoples on religions and criticizes the widespread opinion in the West, which easily sees in Islam the source of all the evils suffered by the societies that belong to it .. And believes that there is no point in asking what It says the truth of Islam, Christianity or Marxism if we seek answers and not merely to affirm negative or positive prejudices, then we should not be entrusted with the essence of belief but rather with the actions of those who have been relying on it throughout history. And he says elsewhere, the twentieth century taught us that there is no liberating doctrine in itself, all beliefs can be deflected, and all can be honed and all their hands are stained with the blood of communism, liberalism and nationalism and all of the major religions and even secularism no one monopolizes intolerance and vice versa no one monopolizes what is Humanitarian . Finally, the wish made by Amin Maalouf at the end of his book seems very far away, or almost impossible, at least for our time.
What is the purest messenger of Hamzatov and what filtered his heart ... Although I did not hear and see my vision of Dagestan, I read it, saw it, and loved it in the words of Rasul full of love for its land, its plain, its mountains, its soil, its rocks, its sky and everything in it ... Having visited many countries,. And I came home tired of the road,. Dagestan bowed over me: Do I live distant longing in you? . I went up to the mountain and from that height. Dagestan answered, and she sighed deeply :. You have visited many areas, but you are. You love all over the world .. Perhaps, I seldom swear love to you ,. There is no new love, and it is not new to swear. I love silently, because I fear. To recite the repeated word hundreds of times .. And if each of your sons begins to divide. Love you, shouting, as the caller,. You will tire your rocky peaks. To hear and answer echo in the far .. when you were drowned in tears and blood. Your children marched to death, with the least words. The dagger became a cruel song. She is the voice of swearing to love children .. Then after, when the battles subsided, Your children, Dagestani, are gone. They swore silent with love for you ,. With hammer strokes and a resonant machete .. You have taught me as everybody for centuries. To work and to live without noise, but with courage. She taught us that the word is more important than a horse. And that the mountain people do not saddle their horses without need. .. Nevertheless, I have returned to you from capitals. Far and strange, talkative and false ,. It&#39;s hard for me to keep silent, and I hear a voice. Your singing schedules and majestic mountains ... I have crossed the path of rugged thinking. I turn to insomnia concerns with tears:. I am tired of obsessions. Let me rest .. It is night in the yard. And it is too late to compete. To know more about the beautiful Dagestan. : //. /
.. .. ... ....:. With the ingredients taking place in her aid and you only want to sleep, Khaled Khalil will mind .... between the blink of an eye and her attention, God will change from state to state. Be patient and only your patience with God, be patient patience, confident in the relief, knowing the good destiny, demanding the reward, willing to think bad, be patient no matter what the speeches have inspired, and the paths are darkened in front of you, the victory is with patience, and the relief is with distress, and with hardness is easier. . So give up your time from loss, your age from wasting, your tongue from backbiting, your heart from anxiety, your ear from betrayal and your soul from mistrust. Ayed Abdullah Al-Qarni do not be sad. . People do not look back and do not turn back, because the wind is moving forward and water. It descends forward, and the caravan moves forward, so it does not violate the year of life. . Ayed Abdullah Al-Qarni do not be sad. . You are one day old, neither is yesterday the one who went for his good or bad, nor the day that did not come to me now. Ayed Abdullah Al-Qarni do not be sad. . Do not think that you could have stopped the wall from collapsing, holding the water to spill, preventing the wind from blowing, and keeping the glass to be broken, this is not true to my will and your will, and the fate will fall, the judiciary will be executed, and the letter will be dissolved. . Ayed Abdullah Al-Qarni do not be sad. . The mosque is the afterlife market, the book is a friend of a lifetime, Anis&#39;s work in the grave, and the good character of Taj. Honor, generosity the most beautiful dress.
Wonderful. The hotel is very good, but the delivery service to the campus does not match the prayers time.
A wonderful vacation in Danat Al Ain for families. I liked the pool was great. I didn&#39;t like the lack of water hoses in the bathroom
His language is charming and his meanings are deep ... I intentionally prolong the period of my reading to him, so I do not complete reading after the interruption from where I finished, but I turn pages to read some of what I previously read. I did not seek to complete it until I approached the end and I felt that a mystery would be revealed. I never expected that end. I pulled his will, I had a long pause with her. I recommend his eyes, ears, body and heart. Worm worm. Then he said after he finished writing the will. . It was good for you, O Archer, if you wrote your will, if it were not for it, then you would not have known which riches are your wealth, and you would have thought you have nothing. So the whole universe seeks you and lives between your sides
From what I read the coolest. The most beautiful thing in the novel is that it gives you the ability. To see the light inside each of us
Ok . Cleanliness / calm. Not to deliver to the campus directly
Wonderful stay and great hotel. Every hour, there is a free trip to the Holy Mosque of Mecca throughout the day. Positions in SR
A really great book. In the darkest conditions of my life, I met him. And it had a great effect on the air of hope. And fill my lungs with the aroma of life again. Thanks to Dr. Abdullah Al-Maghlouth. many thanks
This book, and the dream that put me in it, is priceless
Thank you from the depths for the spaciousness and hospitality. Room services reception services.
She is a human by far. This man was his encyclopedia, so he was presenting art without words, reaching out to the public and loving him so far.
Cleanliness and ethics of employees. Everything is beautiful in the hotel .... meters from the sanctuary, unlike what is written on the site
Happy Eid in Ramada. Near the site, the swimming pool treated the individuals.
Excellent . Quietness and cleanliness of the hotel The distance is average between the complexes, the Dubai Mall .Emirates MallThe Internet is expensive, so why. Give me every night a user, and may God reward him with good, but it is required for free
A wonderful, beautiful and enjoyable trip. It was an excellent trip and beyond expected, and the crew was more eager to handle, calm, rest and clean. Nothing noteworthy
I am sad that the body, as well as the soul, does not have wings flying in the sky, but that one has a permanent ambition that drives him to the perches and forward. Faust the man whose soul always aspires to the highest but cannot endure staying, he is imprisoned in his body and himself .. Faust the person who goes himself down to the world of the earth and desires but he cannot stand survival because his instinct refuses to degenerate .. And between these two oscillates the power of the soul and the strength of the soul and all of them They gravitate to him .. But Faust is the European man who wants to be a part of the upper world never descends, he wants to be an ideal honest family surrounding everything. And I think this is what Goethe criticizes, which causes him to fall down and accompany Satan himself, seducing women, killing and harming them. But with all his crimes, a person insinuates and breaks his fast .. In the night of the Aalborg and Revelation Night Burg, which is a party for the king of the jinn and attended by demons and imps. And in this chapter Goethe criticizes and analyzes in short terms various philosophies .. He says: Many dreams: The dreams that filled my imagination, have tyrannized to me this time, ie tyranny. And for my life, if all my delusion is now true, then today I am a mad fool. . A man of tangible facts. Being here is a source of my suffering and suffering. For the first time in my life, he showed me not sure of myself, and my faith is about to be shaken. . All of this is the first part of a novel that Goethe has embraced for years and has left us with a lot of smack yet. In the second part, Faustus returns, regrets, and repents to show Adam’s first human .. The translator’s language is good and clear, but he interfered to explain in the footnote the purpose of Goethe and what it means and this I think is confiscation of the reader and this is not his place, and if he wanted to mention that in his introduction or In an independent literary and critical work. And this is what I did not like and it was repeated a lot.
No comment can describe its magnificence .. It is difficult for life to simplify
good. Location. Not to bring requests to the room quickly
Forgive you, Lord. . Lack of attention to room service is very weak
good. Cleanliness, room space and quiet.
A fruitful and mellow work, whose roots extend and cushion in the mind .. It raised many questions and shocks inside me, and Zidane also carefully led me to that era with all its ups and downs, as I felt the prestige of the troubled Moses in every step he took in the novel .. This is called Successful philosophical work.
I read it when I really needed it. The most part I did not like. It is his talk about Alexander the Great
About the novel &quot;The Bamboo Stalk ... This novel is one of the most wonderful things I have ever read in the book ... The writer Saud took me on a journey through time and space to a new world. Issa or obsessive about his problem that has no solution .. Being that he does not belong to any country in them and his confusion between Kuwait and the Philippines that he is a Filipino cannot live on this principle, but this half is frequent with his Kuwaiti half .. As I was impressed greatly by his exhaustive research on God Almighty between Many religions .. That opportunity that did not come to many of us by virtue of birth in a particular religion .. which is a blessing Printed by God Almighty .. He unified him with nature and his overwhelming love for it made me as if I smelled the scents of nature and sat under the big mango tree in his grandfather&#39;s garden .. That man who was exhausted by war and framed part of his mind .. Also, the legend of the pineapple mentioned by the writer was As a new piece of information of its kind .. I loved Kuwait, despite its negative aspects, as I liked Egypt .. It removed dust from the human sense inside me towards all human beings; for each of them has an entity, feelings, belonging and circumstances that must be fully respected .. and not treating humans as machines that do not Reason or understanding ... the pleasure of reading in this novel is endless .. it is a masterpiece that every Arab takes pride in ... Best Regards
Exceptional. Luxurious wing and view. The dirt road before the hotel, construction work around the hotel
Speech is a lot of flaw in the right of this narration, so I will write Review of Summary. A tight construction for events and personalities. Easy language and seamless style is never boring. Constant suspense throughout the novel from the rise and fall of the regime and the conflicting characters. My first reading of Ashraf Al-Ashmawi and I did not regret this moment with this decision
Awesome. The location, price and dealings of reception staff, especially Mohamed Rashid. Nothing
This book may not be worthy of five stars, but there is a good effort from the writer in thinking that deserves appreciation
One of the best books written by Omar Taher means after dogs do not eat chocolate along. Omar Taher offers a lot of irony in many situations in Egypt, but in a way that is not vulgar and unpopular, as many people do not do. Of course, his language is easy to mix between colloquial and simple Arabic language without verbal complication and no words. Originally, he needs profound words in any satirical book. I liked very much the first article in the book that was named on behalf of the new Muslims. This was the best article I almost read in my life. It talks about the conditions of new Muslims in the world, and how they rejoice in Starbucks and KFC that is on campus, and so on. I liked a lot of articles like why I encourage Zamalek, I liked persistence in principle, and I liked the guardianship of Egyptian protections for her daughter&#39;s control of marital nest:. The book is, in general, very beautiful and entertaining. You can save on one rule
The least thing I would describe the novel as is a masterpiece in every word in a metaphor. This is another story that I read for Nour Abdel-Majid, despite the separation. I do not know how come this is ?? The novel has everything in it. It is a masterpiece. The style of the novel. I liked it very much, Medhat Abdul Rahman, with his intelligence, kindness, wisdom and way of looking at the problems, I liked his devotion to his wife and his tenderness, Ali Shahira, and how he stood by her in every need, I liked his generosity and loyalty to them and his affection for them, every thing in it I liked. Awowi Ali Raouf was upset because of what he had done. It was an example of a faithful, faithful, loyal and faithful man. She was more than famous because of her method of revenge against Raouf. The novel influenced me rigidly and made me do many things, the most important of which is what Baha said: There are things that are not forgotten .. There is no forgiveness or forgiveness. But we must continue our lives and try to build all that is destroyed and stand again and we look forward. Hard to tell a masterpiece .. Thanks to Nour Abdul Majeed for the second time:
Good stay. Breakfast is good .. room is very good and spacious .. the buffet is great. Food prices, especially at the pool, are very high and do not match the quality and quality of the food. There is no beaching to the point that no one is watching who is at sea .. You find rescue workers at the pool and you don&#39;t find anyone on the beach
..,. ,. .. .. My friend, who has a lot of confidence in her opinion, told me, this book is a real treasure and I would like it if everyone read it, and I did not expect the fact that the young author has a deep knowledge to write in such deep thought. The words of my friend encouraged me to read this book, and because I could not go to the library, I uploaded an electronic copy of the book and started reading the first chapter and formed a general idea about it, and because my specialization in Islamic studies found ease in understanding a lot of what he mentioned, the majority of his articles are religious intellectual dialogues, and I found them Most of them are in agreement with what we studied, but some phrases and points I wished if I reviewed them more, and some of them are general observations such as his inference that the Arabs honored women except after Islam and inferred with Khadija’s trade and the poetic status of Khansa and the power of opinion of Hind bint Ataba and it is known that these women were like that before Islam and increased Islam attributed them Status. .,. ,. ,. I found that this book is a scientific mental response based on Islamic visions of many questions of the mind in this era in an easy and easy way. Sultan Al-Musa in this book is flying us in his own journey of research and learning, starting from his first position with the first atheist he saw in his life to the conclusion of his book that summarizes There is a way for everyone who has a question inside, saying:. . ,. Trust, O man, that knowledge and work will never come to you on a plate of gold. ,. ,. This book is suitable for the secondary stage and above, this stage is the most frequently asked questions of young people, I liked the fact of his way of presenting the issue of women, and many others,. ,. ,. The book is easy, simple, the style is about two hundred pages, and as far as I know it is about fifty riyals. I expect that I will buy it soon, so I am not satisfied with the electronic version and I think it will benefit me as a reference later. ,. ,. Thank you Sultan Al-Mousa for your book
The writer dropped his theory in the psychology of the masses and established it by telling the French Revolution in terms of the collective awareness of its masses. It may be less enjoyable than the first book being, but it is undoubtedly no less useful.
Beautiful hotel. The reception was great and the hotel location is very beautiful with a view of the Sanctuary. The Suhoor was varied and good. Difficulty accessing the hotel due to business and transfers .. Lack of availability of car parking near the hotel and the high cost of available parking despite the riyal dimension for the day
Carefully selected satirical articles, some of them are really great, they managed to extract the laugh from me in my worst psychological conditions, and others did not like me. The book as a whole is great
The hotel has several bars that disturb guests. . There are many bars in the hotel
very good. The location of the hotel. Cleaners are not responding to hygiene so bad
good. Location, beach, Souk El Berry mall and high hygiene. The bed is somewhat not comfortable, the small size of the TV screen, the breakfast of the rooms is not up to the level required in terms of arrangement and presentation. The room service should be reviewed.
Rarely do I start reading a book and Masibush unless I dedicate it ... Adrenaline was one of them. The first book I read for Dr. Ahmed. I enjoyed his style that makes him swim in his interesting imagination .. Discusses faith in a different attractive way. Give a new concept of faith that I have not tasted before. Hadith Qudsi is the focus of the book .. It may pass on some like any hadith. It may be a reason for a person to enter the committee. Adrenaline is not just a hormone secreted by fear or anxiety. It is also secreted when jealous of your religion
Beautiful and classy. Nice room overlooking the pool, the sea, the golf course, a great location, the parking lots are large, excellent, comfortable and distinctive, and I will repeat the visit the most beautiful thing in the hotel, the balcony where it has a tractor to cover the sun to the right and left, even to cover you so that others will not see you so beautiful. Plenty of pilots passing over the hotel and this is normal in all Yas Island because it is near Abu Dhabi airport when cleaning rooms they use puff puff sprays or insect killers with a very bad smell that stays for a long time and they use it in corridors and rooms are not good for those who suffer from chest diseases and asthma
One of the most beautiful novels of Ihsan Abdel Quddus ever
One of the most beautiful things I read in prayer. God have mercy on Dr. Farid Al-Ansari and his spacious accommodation. Oh God, make the apple of my eyes in prayer
Excellent . The location is close to the campus and has a very good commercial complex. nothing
A very quiet comfortable hotel. A very comfortable hotel that provides you with everything you need. nothing
Best mobile ever from Samsung in terms of capabilities and quality
I moved between the flanks of the book ... From the ears to the words of God is greater .. You are open to prayer ... Beautiful when we feel those great meanings that the words of the ears carry .. Linked to those divine times of the five prayers ... The light of ablution that flows from its waters springs a life for souls ... Then we direct our hearts and eyes, and indeed every cell in us moves towards the great divine kiss .. It is his home and his glory be to Him .. Larger
Although there were reservations about the Sufis before me, Shams Tabrizi was not only impressed by his forty rules in divine love, but all his words were rules of love, an important narration
Simple but lovely hotel. Breakfast was very good. Bread, fruit, milk, corn flakes, salads, olives, pies .... The room was very clean and the host was very friendly and helpful, as were the rest of the hotel staff. The room included soap, shampoo, towels, shower caps, cotton buds and slippers. The only bad thing is that you should wear earplugs if you are affected by noise during sleep, as it is easy to hear sounds and the doors are heard from other rooms. Fortunately there was no noise due to the traffic in our room despite it being near the street.
Exceptional. The hotel is very cheap for all its services and quality. There is no
The headphone and a message to God Almighty and the rose. No rose flower may be harvested from the flower garden ..... so I break my habit on the review. Just enjoy the flowers of Ibrahim Aslan.
One of the books I most enjoyed reading .. The five stars are few
Praise to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. Yahya Hakki presented his vision of the worst of Egyptian popular society in the 1940s, using Ismail&#39;s character.
Happy residence. Excellent services. There are no served snack rooms after midnight. The breakfast buffet is modest
Journey to search for meaning .. Shehata meaning. Omar Hamzawy is bewildering life .. After science has combined art to become a mess of a clown .. He has rejected religion from a time .. He does not understand the complex science with his long equations, perhaps if he understood him, he was fed up with it and did not find in his profession a meaning of the meaning .. A struggle is absurd .. Saddam without a goal .. What if you won the case and took the property and then the state took it .. The important thing is that we win the case .. Do we not live our lives while we know that God will take it .. What next? . He gets sick .. The disease of losing meaning .. The meaning is begged between the arms of the singers .. In the faith of poetry and a mysterious light at dawn Is this ecstasy .. Certainly without question .. Is it not worth us to reject the world for its sake? Our hero goes crazy without meaning or trance, I think of you all day and then the passions mess around in my dream .. This means that I have not been cleared of my illness yet. If you really don&#39;t want me, why did you leave me?
A very useful book. Civilian with information for the first time get to know it. From the Berbers who live in the countries of Morocco. And the history of the Islamic conquest of the countries of Morocco. And how the state fell and only carried the name. And its people returned to the pre-Islamic customs. And how it regained its glory again with Abdullah bin Yassin. He who started the bond with the Senegal River and five who answered his call to pray. Then the country would expand. By Yusuf bin Tashfin, Emir of the Muslims and Nasir al-Din. For me, the first part of the book is a supplement to Azazel. Defining me in Arianism. Also complementary to the Granada Trilogy. I am introduced to the history of Andalusia and the age of sects. And how was the division. My misfortune about the book is the untidy narration and the unnecessary prolongation in the second part of it. Overall the book is wonderful
I wish it was in a paper, I can put it at the hands of the door in case I do not want to clean the place. Cleanliness of the place as if it is new and the location. All services are available under the supermarket. An hour is open. I took a large apartment and the only problem is that some rooms do not have a key for air conditioning and I did not know how to clear it or open it
Awesome. everything. everything
A deep, strong biography that shakes you inside and out
good. . Waiting for the car to bring it from the parking, for no longer than an hour
I have lived a Saudi and a Palestinian at the same time, a Saudi with a high sense of the land I lived in implanted, and a Palestinian with what a chisel implied in my roots towards me being a stranger with a cause
good. Quiet and clean .. some services are bad. Reception is far from rooms.
One of the most beautiful holidays. Privacy, God bless you. the price is too high
Knight docked with a screen. Free reception, hygiene and breakfast staff.
Business trip to the residence in Al-Raqqa. . Breakfast is not encouraging
I love these novels, which keep me tight for them until I finish them in a few hours, no matter how many pages there are, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s no wonder that I love Egyptian literature in general. :. Yesterday I saw a scene from the open door movie, especially the scene was a night reading of the message of Hussein, the message full of love, support and hope .. When I realized that this narration is the same as the movie, the decision came quickly and must be read .. The novel deals with the political events that took place in Egypt From the mid-forties to the tripartite aggression, as well as Laila&#39;s life and its progression from childhood to boyhood for maturity .. The novel is full of revolution, enthusiasm and questions that undoubtedly passed on to many girls: Why am I not? What is different between me and the young man? Why this inferior view? Through the events of the novel, the idea of origins, customs and traditions that cannot be departed is always repeated .. He shows us many examples, about salon marriage or the interest and what it entails for the girl, and about the traditional eastern man who sees his partner only as a dependent and submissive person and about the people who always defy their society with all His norms ... Leila understands the secret, reaches the door and opens it .. And as she finally arrives and understands herself .. It is a beautiful novel, and her thoughts are so, it is unfortunate that you never feel that she wrote in the sixties, the situation is not the same .. We are still living in confusion and being lost in Identification, and in submitting to ballet habits ... or rejection and freedom, we are Ola .. God helps overriding
The Philippines is a country stigmatized in our underdeveloped Arab world as just a place to supply cheap labor, especially maids. Knowing that it is a country that possesses civilization, history, resistance against the occupier, and elements of a decent state. The plot that Saud Al-Sanousi played against us all of us Arabs. If you replaced Kuwait with any other Arab country, the novel would not lose its credibility and our racism against each other as human beings. Al-Sanousi reminds me of the writings of Naguib Mahfouz, where the narratives are fluid and searching for the faith in what surrounds them. In you. I will definitely try reading it again
A very beautiful book, a really great treasure .. When I read the book, I was happy and sad at the same time .. I was very happy with what they did, and I was saddened more by what we put in .. In every science, they did a great deal .. Nearly everything we use now is from the invention of Muslims, or it completes it When they did .. the book is more like a magazine and it has many pictures and I do not like this type very much but I enjoyed it very much, I advise you .. quote :. Imagine a time and place in which people from different countries, cultures, religions and backgrounds work to discover new knowledge, understand more about the world and come up with new innovations that they trade with each other with the utmost openness and freedom. A world whose dominant language is science and which is a language used for the good of all. A world in which progress relies on the circulation of ideas and action in a framework of cooperation .. He once found such a time and place. This was too long ago, perhaps forgotten.
The best thing that has happened at the moment is the timing of reading the novel in Nessbali, the likeness of the situation that I live together myself, there is a difference in the age and circumstances of the protagonist between us, but it is not far from what is a sense of what I am. The description was a very decree I almost witnessed. I think that the moments of boredom that I felt in the text were due to translation, not the author. . Juan is a lot of details and artistic painting, and I love the details and my look is very good. As for the novel itself, the subject of the novel is very sweet and will happen very much, even if I felt some selfishness in the story somewhat, but he would soon return to your sympathy with the heroine, as if he plays the thin dividing line between selfishness and the search for self.
Excellent view. The hotel is characterized by: breakfast, speed of arrival at the hotel. Unfortunately, due to its expansion, the gates of the Temple Mount became more distant. The hotel photos did not happen, the health club is closed
Beyond description. This poet reached with the activation poem the maximum energies of its deposit. As if to say to you:. I do not lean on words and do not believe in the length of the poem. I will bombard a thousand fronts with four stubborn lines. I enjoy Ahmed Matar&#39;s hair and find unique intelligence in it:. A whole court, despite its shortness, its poems do not depart from the subject of the hour, then take with each hand a poem to teach you a new meaning for the hour, for the hands, for the matrix numbers, for the face of the wall, for the philosophy of time, colonialism, politics, and cheating boards ... Symbols and codes, and whenever I read it after that, I laughed at the poet’s cunning and saddened by the sadness in the words boiling over the fire of the protector and the calm tones .. The most beautiful poems:. the Council. The loser. Lesson. I noticed a strange resemblance between his style and the style of Tamim Al-Barghouti, it seems that the other is affected by the extent that it seems to me that the loser section in the court here is identical to the idea of the poem of the chessboard of Tamim, although I do not like that. The loser:. When the scorpion is attached to the scorpion. Only kill moments. How many wars they have. Then they got up, without a wound,. And the army of time is dead. I will not hope for the repetition of these poems. What is the most beautiful words when worded by a rebel genius
very good. Location cleanliness.
In fact, there is no stamp .. for every end has an extension that starts with everything ....
The amount of beauty that filled my soul, gratitude, love,. The universe that met in my life and inspired me. While you are at the side of this book, you realize how much your soul would have lost if you had not been able to meet it. And realize how hard you are and far from me. The books rarely cry me, or let’s say that two or three books did that yet. But I never cried with beauty and gratitude. I cry .. and I feel that something in my soul expands to accommodate everything as I increase a page. My family .. very much. I also don’t remember that I cried parting a book. Or I left my cells, and I carry it farewell. But I did with this captive, during his reading, and at the end, in which my soul was set off. I wished it was not over. But I am sure I will sip beauty again. Grateful for my destiny. And much changed,. As Shams said: Every true love or friendship is the story of an unexpected twist. And if we remain the same person before and after love, This means that our love was not enough .. And I, when I prepared his pages to meet again, ending what is in its flanks. I can almost assert that what was between us .. deeper than between a book and a reader. It was love ..
Wonderful and recommend it. everything. Only the pillow is uncomfortable and kinda expensive
I recommend dealing with it. The staff is once excellent and helpful. there is nothing
In this narration, the bad side of Egyptian society is inherent in its other half or a quarter, whatever:. The novel is profound and realistic, and the style is interesting with the sequence of events, but the emerging words are very good in a way that is not at all reassuring for the future of modern literature and the extent of its collapse and deterioration. I felt the writer’s surrender to this unfortunate reality without trying to change it. I see the novel from the same angle from which Hussein al-Zahar sees society and observing him from the window of his dark room in terrible silence and finite precision, then trying to change it in a mistake ... a little mistake, we fix with it the biggest mistakes ... and with this a person gradually loses himself with every small mistake to To become the biggest mistake society has ever known ... I hope we will correct the small mistakes before the big ones because the end does not justify the means:
Wonderful book, wonderful wonderful wonderful inspired me a lot in many topics ,,. I consider this book a treasure in my hands, really a very valuable treasure. I liked the book and loved it so much that I read it in one go and finished it in two hours. This book dealt with many issues I was despising in society and I hearted with his words. Its style is very cool, light, smooth and easy to speak. If I talked to tomorrow about the magnificence of this book, I will not give it its right. A book that I would advise everyone to do .. If I could give it a value of ten stars
Very beautiful, easy language, and very exciting events. I enjoyed reading it
Exceptional. . The absence of water in Al-Afranji, may God bless you
Beautiful and comfortable hotel. Everything is nice, the staff is excellent, thank the Egyptian young man for the good help. nothing
Exceptional. Everything is sweet. There is no cable nearby at the bed to charge the phones
That you, O Gibran, touch a spiritual side with your writings, you touch the fingers of the letters in my soul, which are sympathetic and supportive, in a spirit that is similar in grief to amuse the pain that made my soul drown in the mire of swamps .... These are excerpts from the book. I do not replace the sorrows of my heart with the joys of people, and I am not satisfied that the tears that turn from depression will turn from my sorrows and become laughter .. I hope that my life will remain a tear and a smile: a tear that cleanses my heart and understands the secrets of life and its mysteries and a smile that insults me from the people of my grandmother and is a symbol of glorification of the gods. A tear I share with the crusaders of the heart and a smile that is a joyful title for my existence .. I want to die an honor and not live boredom .. I want to be in the depths of myself a famine of love and beauty because I looked and saw those who were satisfied with the most difficult people and the closest of the article .. I listened and heard the sighs of the wishful wish The sweetest of the rings of the bladder and the triangle .. The evening comes, and the flower includes its leaves and sleeps And hugged him Hawkha when morning comes open her lips to kiss the sun Aguetbal, longing and flowers The life of intercourse, tear and a smile. The sea water evaporates and rises, then it meets and becomes a cloud and walks over the hills and valleys, even if it meets gentle breezes, weeping towards the fields, joining the streams, and returning to the sea to its habitat ... the life of clouds, separation, and a tear and smile. Such a soul is separated from the general spirit and walks in the world of matter and passes in a cloud over the mountains of sorrows and plains of joys, so it meets the breezes of death and returns to where it was: to the sea of love and beauty to God ....
The frankness of the hotel is modest, nice and close to everything, the Corniche markets. Cleanliness The place is brilliant, beautiful and tidy. Positions only
Exceptional. . Shower in the bathroom is not available
Pullman Zamzam Hotel is a great experience worth repeating. . Very close to the campus. The hotel is quiet and I did not feel inconvenient. The breakfast buffet is clean, varied and delicious.
There is nothing better than the price and value of this hotel. Very cool hotel great value for money. nothing
An amazing book. Whenever I read an analysis, I remembered a position of yours or your society&#39;s backwardness that surrounds us in terms of not knowing man in our societies, oppressed and repressed, and this is a preliminary study of his behavior and motivation, perhaps the separation of women is the most important chapter of the book. Important for all those interested in psychology and the subject of underdevelopment.
The story is very beautiful, its style is sophisticated, and interesting, the events are successive, the language is easy, ranging from classical to colloquial, for me I finished reading it in two days, you feel familiarity between you and its people, and between the places that witnessed its events, after each chapter I find a surprise waiting for me that keeps me going .. I was waiting for the end, and how would the novelist solve this problem, until the last pages ..... Waiting for the new
Excellent . The residence deserves a place suitable for families. The bed size is small for some things, especially for tall people
Exceptional. The location is next to the Noble Sanctuary, the rooms are of excellent capacity, the furniture is unique, the bathrooms are well-appointed, and the reception staff are distinguished.
To believe in an idea, regardless of its health or error, and to work for it, this is life, let alone death and fear of death .. fear an insufficient life and not an unknown death .. do not fear livelihood, do not fear defeats, as many challenges indicate the right path. The story here I talked about the Bolshevik revolution about until the beginning of the mother’s world war was the active protector shield the mother the source of the tales at all times .. here the actual embodiment of faith is mentioned sincerity love working hard sacrifices for an idea for the sake of right .. even though I reserve the principles of the Bolsheviks in what Religion and God belong, but there is no doubt that they have accomplished and demonstrated that life is a revolution that must be lived and that it is Taking a risk on your own money with happiness in time .. At the time you must surrender and bowing to death, but not before that, strive for your idea until the last breath ... ........... You do not deserve to live if you have a piece of bread nor She owns a loaf of bread completely ............ How much this sentence threw me to think of everything going on now in the dirty world and perhaps Syria was the first arrow that hit my mind at that time ... I believe that time will repeat itself the same situations and the same violations And dreams also differ according to the calendar and the appearance of the actors, but the essence is one issue, one in all times.
Osama formed a model for many of the youth of our nation who is pregnant in his idea of a correct understanding of all the ideas about him of love, female, jihad and homeland, but what distinguishes Osama is honesty in all his thoughts, so he reached at the end to the righteousness that formed him from the bad fate in terms of principles and Salvation .. Hossam formed his farewell to the articulation of the model that I adore in expressing love, and the more complete form of love and concealment of the faults of passers-by and overwhelming lust .. between Osama and Hossam found pleasure in this novel and in its smoothness.
Few words paintings have strong meaning from an artist who has a case .. But unfortunately, the issue is now dead .. because of its children and their struggles and because of the Arabs being put down ... and new generations have no sense of the issue ..
A very happy stay and thanks from the heart to Mr. Abdel Fattah. It was a pleasant and wonderful stay, and I don’t forget Mr. Abdel Fattah, the reception was wonderful. nothing
I think stars are underrated. The novel is a feeling that has gathered in a novel, I am not able to describe my feeling now when I concluded it. Palestine .. the camps, the massacres, the occupation. A wonderful description of every feeling of joy, sadness, hope for frustration, refraction and death. Creamy meal hard from every need. And she is talking about Naji Al Ali&#39;s drawings. My cell is my duty, I see them, and I understand them. Memory does not kill. Painfully unbearable pain, perhaps. But as we endure it, it turns from swirls that pull us to the bottom of the sinking to a sea in which we swim. Cut distances. We judge him and dictate our will to him. . I missed you because you are with us ... and absent, and because the pain of absence seemed like a delicate thread braided with another thread ... of pride, perhaps ... It is your gratitude. Lives come together or repel each other for reasons that none of us know. Crying inside her, even if he is bound by silence, it can rise to fill pedestrians in the street. You advise and tighten
In the name of God, forgiving and forgiving. This beautiful book, in which the doctor talks about a trip to the desert in North Africa, specifically the Ghadames Oasis in Algeria, in which he talks about his observations there for the way of life and the situation of the population in the present and the Badia, he spoke about its tribes of Berbers, Amazighs, Tuareg and Targ, he talked about its history in a brief way and about its culture and social customs In joys, sorrows, calamities and wars, he also spoke about the impact of these races on the arrival of Muslim Arabs in language, religion and customs .. I liked the book for its presentation and narration method, the book is not considered a specialized book as it is the closest thing it can be to the personal notes of the writer. In North Africa, I recommend reading it. I will not read it again, but I consider myself going back to it in the future for some of the things he mentioned.
From these poor houses came out armies that ditched Kesri and Caesar ... This is the soil that germinated the best soldiers of the earth and better than the foundations of the nations ... I am adjusted and believed, and grew, O Omar ... I believe and I believe in you. Your Islam was an honor, a victory for you, and your succession in conquest, ... God bless you, son of the speech, O God, grant us the best of you ... I am tired after you so much, Commander of the Faithful ..
Wonderful. The location of the hotel is excellent and the staff are very friendly.
good. Hotel lobby and reception. Some services are mentioned in the bookings and have no mention on the ground
Much holds of our reality
I am tempted by unprecedented and strange ideas. This is what I found in this novel. Where did the author get this idea? Despite some boring details, I enjoyed reading it. Now I consider the smell to be another language without words and grammar. I would recommend reading this novel
Life goes on with what it contains .. everyone is walking .. nothing remains the same, all things for annihilation become. ... get up, it&#39;s your turn to make life
I apologize for the brothers who have notes. Frankly, I see that the restaurant is very great and eat them very delicious from my point of view is better than Shizan who is in Jeddah by far the prices are the same as Shizan and can be less and I hope with all my heart that he maintains his level and will be the best undisputed
good. Proximity to the mosque is about a minute&#39;s walk. Cleanliness is for four stars and with crowds, the cleaning is very good .. Small breakfast buffet in Ramadan. Slow reception staff.
Beautiful and clean hotel. The room is beautiful and clean, the furniture is beautiful and classy. Breakfast is very simple, please diversify and add several other meals, and always eat the same. Very, very tight.
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa..and more wonderful I was ready to be younger and grow up ... because I fail to succeed, because my brother did shine ... One of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life .. His love is strong
What do we know about Palestine as Muslims? I don&#39;t think we really know much. This is what you will discover when you read the book .. The book is characterized by smooth style, interesting pictures ... Oh God, be our Palestinian brothers.
A wonderful. .. Just
Initial review. The creator, Dr. Hussein El-Sayed, was able to compete strongly with the godfather in the durability and quality of the plot of terror. Smooth, wonderful language, well-informed, and abundant information, which means a lot that compels me to run the internet next to the novel to search and learn from the wonderful magical information. The best character ever is Dr. Mohamed Shaheen, a personality that is a very ingenious and delicious mixture and grains between Dr. Rifaat Ismail Mao behind nature, and between the arrogant and well-informed doctor of Safari novels, Dr. Arthur Shelby. And frankly, a great mix. The most wonderful thing is that the character appeared in the following novel, the black sheikh with maturity and the most beautiful details. Thank you very much for this delicious horror meal. And for the rest, God willing
Exceptional. Everything is beautiful. Dinner and lunch are beautiful and well worth the breakfast, but not good
good. Close proximity to markets and the main street. Narrow the toilet, God bless you, the lukewarm reception of the guest, the lack of a suitcase holder at the moment of arrival, the lack of parking spaces, especially at night
Lucky boy
. The most wonderful hotel apartment in the whole kingdom in terms of dealing, cleanliness, high response speed, etc., until the Raffles Makkah Palace compares to the Great Mosque of Mecca. It is appropriate for the level of services that characterize the place.
If you open the novel, you start reading the first pages in it. For a moment, you think that it is an ordinary novel that will tell a little about the suffering of a young man and the Egyptian revolution, and how this young man was affected by it .... But wait .. go deeper into the novel a little bit, then you will see that it is one of the books that may change your outlook for a lot and a lot of things .. you find in the novel that hidden terror .. things that you might really think could happen from what might make you panic and this is one of the writer&#39;s genius points .. the novel was divided between the ruled and the ruler and then both ... she gave us all the details about Khaled greeting the smallest details without the slightest Boredom ... a great writing style that makes you feel the same person and what you mean Behold, as if you were in your mind ... Then we started talking about the ruler, that wonderful character in my estimation, for the first time I do not favor good for evil, but I remain throughout the novel motivated to end it without any hatred for any of the characters ... Salah Al-Najmi is a solemn figure despite everything the writer created In its creation from the ground up. A strong personality eager to learn is pathetic and dazzled together. It captures you with all its events ... The scene of the battle in the novel is a majestic scene and the author described it with precision and magnificence as if you are above the fullest behind the goodness of the state you see the battle ... I thought that the writer would take the revolution like any of the writers who must To pass on the revolution the honorable passage in their books as a kind of rooshness, but I mistook again the revolution is the focus of the novel .. Egypt and Egyptians are the most important things in the novel .. where I mentioned the most important characteristics and the most hateful pests. I spoke and described completely how the Egyptians are exploited from all sides and followed by an end that may be the solution to what we are in .... Finally .. It is really exhausting novels .. But you find pleasure in all your trouble .. Enjoy the pain as delighted by Salah Al-Najmi. So fear their anger and do not ignite a fire that only their Creator extinguishes ... so that they may be victorious with them, they are the best of the earth’s soldiers ...
it was interesting . Everything is good. Only you need to book a family and it is not available
Love is nothing but a state of loss of self-confidence in which sublimation is portrayed to us, and it is only a compensation for that deficiency. With this theory, the book made me come up with new perceptions about the situations that leave the soul, which I cannot explain, and after that I was able to overcome them and gain more control over such feelings. The book needs in-depth reading from my point of view, frequent pauses, connectivity, and internal discourse critical of the writer&#39;s opinion and the feelings of the soul. I have to admit to myself that the book took me out of an internal psychological conflict after an emotional trauma and made me aware of the steadfastness which is the truth that I believe in reading therapy
beautiful and calm . Breakfast, good reception and cleanliness of the place. Unavailability of shaded parking and high prices
God bless you . Thanks to the receptionist, we had booked at the other site of the hotel, but we registered to stay at the new hotel site, I wish only the price is low because it is very high for the service provided. The price is high, and there is no boiling water. We hope that you want to rent from you again, taking into account your customers and those who always come to rent from you and do not equate with the new guest.
good. The decors are different and distinctive. Breakfast is very good. Service staff are helpful. Slow entry procedures, lack of suitable parking, lack of a pool in the club, the view is not directly on the sea
Comfortable hotel. The bed is comfortable. Slippers for the room
The novel as a whole is beautiful, its language is easy and smooth. It compels you to sympathize with its events ... It tells of a story of revolt of dignity that ultimately bears one person. It talks about intolerance about duality and reverence for the leader. It talks about love and wandering. In my view, the novel, with its current events, could have expanded and drowned in pleasure. But she downloaded the helpful manual. Good and light and recommend it
Shegaf touched my heart, especially since its events are realistic ... only what made me late in starting to read it was my aversion to its name. How in my heart .. or the heart of the heroine is a Hebrew female. I tried to find this meaning in the novel and did not find it. Rima .. A Muslim in her heart is a Muslim woman. Nada .. Sara .. Next .. Sonia .. Hebrew women in their hearts, Muslim women ... Otherwise, they will not end up with them except Islam. As for Ahmed .. he is a young, resisting Muslim .. he is a hero not only for the novel .. but also in life ... a hero of the shadow heroes we do not know
The hotel is quite nice. I liked the privacy and there is a person called Mahfouz who helped me a lot in my travel between Mecca and Medina and he was the most openly cooperative one at the hotel. The bathroom cleanliness is very foldable
A translated novel by an Iranian philosophical writer that raises deep concepts, and existential questions on the tongue of its heroes .... very fascinating, confusing, you do not feel the existence of pitfalls for the translator, I translated it carefully, a different novel is not like regular novels, only I did not like its end so it deserves the four stars
A suitable place for families and children. Car parking Beautiful swimming pools Skating rink Ice cream Café Shopkin Robbins
The book is beautiful and discusses Islam in a somewhat philosophical way. I liked the first and last chapters, the book because it is full of examples, comparisons, and connectivity ..
A novel that makes you reconsider about everything around you that re-think what is your goal in life, would you be from the ship&#39;s passengers and not drown in the flood? The writer&#39;s style could have been more than necessary but sometimes the truth needs clarity. I liked the names of the people in the story, especially because I am one of the people who forget the names, but the names of this novel were clear and strongly touched reality. Do you think when will my ship be returned?
She gave me shelter on every line, in which I saw our companions, taking the two men, the prisoners injustice, and they killed treachery and died in the hope of change, and there is no need to change or not change.
Ok . Room overlooked. Pigeons are barbecued
Excellent. Close to the service areas. There are hourly groceries, laundry, pharmacy and many shops, quiet and no hassle. No toiletries such as towels and robes, the suction fan in the hall annoying
Real pain is .. You are in the lines .. I did not hold myself in front of him ... How was the writer able to draft it? And bear it who lived it ... ?? I hope with my heart that the events are not realistic ..
Great cheap hotel. Close to the kingdom, excellent location, reasonable price, comfortable and excellent room, easy parking, nice staff. nothing
good. The design is good and the services are excellent. . The bedroom windows are small and numerous and do not give high daylight. . There is no floor bed for prayer rooms; the prayer mat on ceramic is budging and the worshiper may fall down. . The lounge sofa adjacent to the circular kitchen marble hurts the head from the back.
My visit to the restaurant on the day / hour and evening text after evening prayer, Tahlia branch, Riyadh We asked for spiced grape leaves, french fries, kibbeh, finky mix, which means mixed pies, Ali Nazik, chicken kebab, meat patties, spinach, chicken wings. Delicious dishes, especially the dish on Nazik and the kibbeh. Not so sweet, the kebabs are delicious, the prices are reasonable, and all the dishes that I mentioned are in real riyals. The service is not OK.
Unparalleled fun. Dazzle in the service provided. I liked everything
I booked it because the property owner is from my family. The presence of a mosque near the hotel. Bed linen, mosquitoes, bedbugs around the suite and the suite
The hotel is exceptional and super cool. The hotel is very excellent, the staff is very, very good, and the services very comfortable.
The novel is largely linguistically abundant, up to the point of exaggeration sometimes .. A great novel that is not devoid of symbolism as well, especially in the last scene of it for Easa Al-Dabbagh sitting in the dark under the statue of Saad Zaghloul, which suggests his adherence to the parties of the past manifested in the delegation of the delegation to which he previously belonged ... the main character arises from it many questions about the ability of a person to coexist against his will in a world that he does not belong to and feels that he is exiled inside him ... Jesus is concerned with his political and existential ideas, and he is rejected from the reality that he rejected embodied in Riri and her daughter .. but at the same time, The novel ends with its hero attempting to catch life Hand and find a role in which his followers through a young man who came Ajalsh then went ... wonderful short novel.
No problem. All staff, without exception, are keen on the comfort of the inmate and the gate workers receive us if we come from the market and take the purposes from us and deliver them to the room. The speed of the entry procedures entered us at noon. A chapel in the hotel&#39;s breakfast buffet was delicious, varied and clean, and it was not crowded. Lobby sessions are comfortable. There is a large supermarket in the tower and a group of local clothing stores and restaurants. Goodness. There is no elevator. The campus takes you directly. You must replace elevators, or go downstairs with escalators that reach the campus.
The first thing that this novel teaches you is the love of the earth, the land that embraces and compels, which feeds and harbors, even when you become helpless, powerless and lifeless. Nostalgia comes to you, just as I have ... So you say: O my Western .... Feel home pulling from under your feet. Likewise, she wonders how you should. How are your feet. Wit. At. Your dreams and wishes .. You feel everything I feel for me, but your pain is more severe .. Why? You are a stranger in your homeland, because the one who decided on you to leave and pull the land beneath you is not a stranger, not a stranger at all. The novel teaches you something else ... that the rescue will not come to you even after a hundred years ... do not wait and rise to your salvation alone. Then there are books that you must discover are treasure, even after a while.
I learned a lot from you, and I wish I taught you how to not leave me.
It is the story of a man of patience
An enjoyable book to the fullest ... after I finished choosing my books. I sat in the library and took Salma to browse through it until my friend ended. It attracted me so I brought him back and I got out and I am still thinking about this book that I left. I returned to my city and did not forget what I read from it, after a year I went to the capital and acquired it. I did not read it, but its tastes are beautiful, interesting, interesting, I loved it very much. I do not remember that I turned one page bored, but all my senses were motivated to know what was written on the next page
Location and comfort. Good smells and everything.
The book is very sweet
I found a cloud flying in the sky of a sky ... and a sailor found me drowning in the depths of a seas .. and in the sky of the sky .. and the depths of the seas ... My journey was with God, glory to God ... the words of spirituality and lightness surprised me. Frankly a piece of gold.
Fun. . Clean room level
Enjoyable stay. Reception, services and calm, especially receptionist Ahmed. There is no
There is more than a wonderful book, there is Dostonevsky, Aziz Yansen, Muhammad Maghout and many others, a huge amount of the book and their books may spend a very long time until you get to know them as well as read what they wrote and Bilal Fadl knows us quickly in this book .. Unfortunately I finished this book on the same day that I was arrested in the State Security, so I did not have time to write everything I wanted about it, and to quote some of what Bilal Fadl quoted from these writers and wrote them, I think the best thing in the book is his talk about Aziz Yansen and his writings, and the house that he built for orphaned children of unknown proportions .. I may have an opportunity soon and write quotes from my favorite book.
I finished reading the novel ... remarkable in terms of artistic aspects ... I really escaped with storytelling, sincere style, and the wonderful emotional flow that characterizes the story, either distinction ... is a bit similar | with Sarah&#39;s story of the decade at least the first part of it, or the easy version is the end of it .. The idea of the novel is a little naive ... And lastly: If only the novel had anything but gifting, I would have enough.
Excellent . Everything. nothing
good. . Breakfast hall. Small and crowded and breakfast is ok. Quickly. Late does not find. Shi
I read the whole series and most of it is on the lab. This series is in a love story that does not end in hard. All that remains is harassment, and I do not want anything in the world. I open a story from the series and live with it. I go out to their big little world and all of them. I live the adventure moment by moment and fear for a woman and The amygdala, who lives along with kidnapping, and laughing, atef, the inventor of the first invention of children, and the big ones. What remains is she picking out the smartness? Can he come out of Egypt from her ordeal? And I, by his nomination, will be the president. By God, instead of the political impairments that exist now, Mancer Zangar is the faithful friend. This was the first thing that I raised in my life from what I had years and still lived with me with what she said years ago:
Exceptional. Reception. nothing there
good. Close to the Prophet&#39;s Mosque and clean. Quite expensive
Excellent hotel. Spacious parking, quietness and comfort in hotel facilities. Breakfast is a very disappointing fact, the poor quality of dishes provided in terms of cooking, not to mention old fruits and vegetables.
To read my comment, follow the link below. : //. . / / ...
When you read a book and take you from your world, it has created its writer ... This is what this novel did to me
Excellent. Calm, comfort and cleanliness.
The calm. Tranquility, comfort, safety, smile, breakfast, room service, multi-storey parking, underneath the hotel. There is no luggage holder and the inmate must rely on carrying the bags himself
Exceptional. Beach, afforestation and gardens is the only hotel in Sharqia that has a private beach. Also, having a female club with a pool and a jacuzzi, but I did not use it because my time was Eid and Jahma, I thought I would try it. God willing, I will have a second visit to him .. They refused to give us coupons that we can use to use with them on the pretext that we booked through bookings MB on their way.
The greatest novel I&#39;ve read
This novel touched a great sorrow and I hide it among the folds of myself. I liked this story because of the realism of its subject. It was blown away in its pages. I hate this character, I loved Noha and immortal, and sympathized with Ezzat. She deserves five stars with merit. One of the best things I&#39;ve read about Nour Abdel Majid.
A book that I acquired, not to search for something new, it is just a compilation of the dreams that are scattered everywhere and I knew that .. But it is a nice opportunity to recover something from the past, that novice reader that I was, and that novice lover waiting for something greater than love and greater In fact, it is beautiful after we change and change everything around us, to regain what has gone through with a smile, and to offer this bouquet of romance, a salute to all the past.
Unconcern . Good hotel. Wi-Fi
Exceptional. The price is cheap for the size of the apartment.
May God be pleased with the friend .. An incomplete star for the sake of the method, not for the sake of the topic .. The book has many comparisons between Omar and Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with them, which is a comparison that preserves their right, but I wish that there was no comparison, even if Akkad replaced it with his wonderful and intelligent analyzes The friend’s personality is more intense because I see that this part of the geniuses is less in presentation and style than the geniuses that I have read before .. I loved the last parts of the book in which he talked about the structures of Abu Bakr Aisha and the mother of the believers and the names of God, may God be pleased with them ... And his good-hearted companions.
Late reservation. I liked the business center. I did not like the reception and the delay in booking and the bathrooms with the need to change
Two N Suites. I would like to thank Brother Mustafa for his generous chest, good reception, beautiful morals and the rest of the crew for their kindness and cooperation and my destination will be to them during my travel to Riyadh. I think there is a bad experience in 2N hotel suites
A sweet novel, but a little slow, although I hear that the author is all interesting and very fast. strange thing
Excellent place. The crew in Shushan cleanliness calm comfort. Distance from the center of Abu Dhabi
Restaurant and the best frankness, I like decor and food, its smell connects you with Hanouf
Wonderful book. I originally conceived it just based on the success of the series. But, on the contrary, the book served the series. Wonderful dr. Badria Humans. And I wait for the end of Hind and the break with which I started today. Thank you, Badriya Al-Bishr, for this kind effort. Contrary to what some people photographed me and comments. I am religious, praise be to God. But I read all open perceptions of communities and religions. Good bless you
A genius novel is indeed one of the most wonderful novels that I have read so far .. Strangely, this ability to weave a world full of blind people is of no importance to names where man and all the good and evil his humanity carries. When the animal side of our nature becomes more evident .. When a person starts with small concessions, life loses all its meaning in the end. The idea of losing your dignity is your self-esteem in the midst of this struggle of meanness and meanness for survival .. What is all this amazement? Look around you and look carefully .. Not to do that we also in one way or another to survive. What ? Can not you see ? . I do not think that we are blind, but I think that we are blind, blind and see blind human beings who can see, but they do not see ..
When I was going from Jeddah to my village in Al-Baha. I found this book in my car, but it was issued by Sheikh Ayed. His way of narrating and the tone of his voice made me feel calm and joyful. I remember that the tape lasted an hour ,,, involuntarily, due to the large number of rulings, and the tape was repeated over and over until I reached my village. As soon as I returned to Jeddah and if I were in the Obeikan library, I wanted a copy of his book, but unfortunately I did not find it. I searched more than one library in Jeddah. I did not find it. So I uploaded an e-book and read it back. Actually for me is better than a book don&#39;t be sad
Gorgeous . Everything in which all employees are service and security forgot purchases and items they have returned after four days and all are present and preserved. nothing
good. Its price is reasonable compared to its location, cleanliness and availability of services.
Between the beauty of the meaning, the refinement of the word, and the depth of feeling, I lived in Rehab Bint Al Shati for a few days
Live with the Wise
Good experience and hope to see improvement next time. The location is excellent, the chalets in general are excellent in shape from the outside and need some improvement and attention from the inside to provide towels and change of bed sheets daily. The air conditioning is excellent. The private pool needs more attention. The public pool is excellent and the beach is large and clean. Failure to provide towels and napkins for two days, despite repeated contact until the hotel manager enters. The reception unfortunately needs some follow-up with thanks to Omar, the lack of restaurant and breakfast service, such as other chalets and hotels.
Wonderful. . Food is very bad
good. . There is a distance from the sanctuary of Mecca about a meter away
Reasons for the coldness of the nation that was reached after the first six meetings, which were divided by the planetary religious, political and moral, and mentioned under it eighty-six reasons .... In my opinion, they are six main reasons at the end :. Faulty belief. .... Moving away from the main sources and citing them according to our efforts to emulate the doctrines or people emanating. .... division and neglect of the wisdom of the group and Friday and the dissolution of the religious bond. The absence of justice. .... The hidden polytheism and what makes the pharaoh in the end. .... superficial understanding of religion. .......... It is not really strange that the germ of the disease is absolute ignorance because Mankesh our Lord did not download it the first word .. the first treatment because he knows about the disease that is wary of it
Excellent. Excellent The only drawback at the moment is the fact that there are road repairs around the hotel that make it more difficult to reach.
This novel made me read all of Ahmed Murad&#39;s novels
Nice . everything.
The discourse in philosophical history is wonderful. On the other hand, the storytelling was modest.
good. Location and decoration. The cabbage is dirty
In order to socialize my son
You only know a little. Al-Wardi talks about subconscious or the unconscious mind with beautiful words. There is little research in this matter, and therefore he tries to highlight in a scientific way the importance of belief and belief alongside the grandfather. As he said: Most of the inventions, such as telephones and x-rays were taboo and impossible in the past. The children of this generation despise the self and the soul, and they see it as contradicting the belief in the unseen .. I was very surprised when I learned that many call the Rosary that he is secular and secular, as far as I know: he separates religion and the world. This is the opposite of what he does in my opinion. Belief in the unseen and the soul does not indicate that there is no logic behind it and should be sought and knowledge of it, just as belief in death is a right does not mean that there are many causes that lead to it and its study is desirable .. After reading the book, I would like to read more about magic and superpowers. Which I have never thought of .. What is wrong with the book is its very long introduction, which you did not like me personally. Chapters 4 and 5 are my favorites .. Finally, I look at the book as asking questions and not giving answers. Because the answers are his personal opinions and analyzes, and they are full of contradictions that he personally admits ... Life is full of problems that one can hardly get rid of one of them alone so that he suffers from confronting the other
The road to impossible cities separated me from the roads
Ahmed Matar is one of the reasons I love poetry, if not the main reason. I started reading his poems when I was years old and I still memorize them. Reading the complete works was a mixture of enjoying his poetry and restoring memories .. In short, Ahmed Matar Genius
Excellent. Nice. There is no
The first book I bought for Muhammad Afifi ... It was from the bed of Dar Akhbar today in the book fair in the year AD of the years ... almost, oh so need ... because I was purchasing with him a part of Harry Potter .... From that day I discovered a giant of irony giants did not He gets his right in any way, and I added to him until I fed..Arto did not assert it until I added thirst ...
Suitable for families. Cleanliness is excellent and ample room spaces, and the breakfast is varied and delicious. The lighting is light in the rooms and hallways, and there are no curtains in the kitchen
Exceptional. I would like to thank all the hotel workers for the high level of service that did not happen and I have met like it in the past during my experience of five-star hotels.
Great hotel. Everything is perfect for newlyweds. Exposed shower bath
Ordinary or self-track as I like to call it. The author, Dr. Mostafa Seif presented. His hero Aamir, who represents every human being in us, and who did not get Imran himself except in the midst of the greater wandering. We are all Aamir who used to beat the liver of the earth to ask for gold, but he was searching for his absent heart in its hollow. He was hitting the earth without mercy, crucifying himself as we were together. Gold is in the heart of fallow, and by it he finds light in himself, even after a while .. The writer moved in flexibility and smoothness to the fluctuations of the different soul by its delinquency by obedience to it and presented in strength to that genie that we fear collectively and is facing ourselves presented this through easy and sound language and the idea of the novel is very strong and passion is overwhelming and the narration Distinctive and filled with genius phrases and phrases close to oneself and informed What is in it is that it will touch a part of every human soul and present images of those distant depths, and the end is distinguished by being appropriate and attractive, as each soul ends with an end that fits with what it is filled with .. It will remain the truest author of what the author wrote, but Dr. Mustafa&#39;s writings are characterized by a strong sense and symbolism characterized by two things . First, it respects the reader&#39;s mindset and makes him think a lot. Symbolism is a color of writing that requires the realization of the mind. Second, it makes him leave his imagination unleashed, envisioned, and thinks in his own way. Ten people find each of them imagining his own connotations and his own point of view. .. And the author possesses that character that makes you realize his writings from all the colors of writing, and the ordinary will not be his creativity. The best is that it is only a beginning ... Personally, I learned from it that the end is not achieved until when we have made the last of our love as happiness or the last of what we have From the purity of Ali or another of our greed and greed as a whole who seeks money a And what we have to seek to know God as the end of Amer. And every soul has great luck with what you have been filled with, so beware yourselves .. The novel is beautiful and good luck, Doctor
In this book, Shereen proceeds to recite her autobiography but in a light, beautiful and interesting way, as if she reads a story, and she did not limit the topic to herself but rather spoke about Iran from a legal and social angle, she listed the most important changes that Iranian society experienced from the era of the Shah until the era Shiite rule, and how the life of the Iranian individual changed and how the Iranian people struggled to change for the better .. It was an interesting reading, even if I had some drawbacks .. I recommend it
Very good hotel. . Breakfast is not varied every day, the same breakfast with two or more dishes
A wonderful book and an amazing end I did not expect that the character was also coveted in the legacy Hahaha
good. crew. Positions
As usual every period, I went to the Jarir Bookstore to see the new books and acquire some of them, in renewal of thought, reason and soul as well. I immediately refrained from many books and refrained from acquiring many of them for several reasons that were established after many visits to these commercial libraries: What is permanently observed in it is the abundance of nausea and absurdity in the Arab cultural product, from publications and books. It is, in addition to its small and weak percentage compared to European and American countries, this little is dominated by collection, tradition, copying and banality .. The price of prices is not tolerated by the largest percentage of shoppers and even class members. Medium compared to an average sized book is not worth all that high amount. The Internet has enriched many books such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, books of information and the like, there is no need to purchase these books and spend huge amounts of money on it, and there is something that sings them in electronic ways easier .. Having a long row of books awaiting reading in my library and my home, there is no need to multiply from other books, But just a simple update and additions here and there ... I finished a medium-length tour of the library with four books. I was surprised at the accountant that they were all novels unintentionally, although I do not care much about them, but I balance them with many other cultural and intellectual books .. I returned home I went to the ground and put the narrators around The Four and a computer open to technical subjects, I imagined that the owners of these accounts and those technical subjects were sitting around me in a unique episode, as if most of them were dead cultural preparation session. Yahya Hakki and I were with his novel Qandil Umm Hashem ... With us Taha Hussein and his novel Al-Ayyam .. There is a neighborhood between the living and it is Amin Maalouf and his African novels Lyon. Then the late Naguib Mahfouz and some of his chatter over the Nile .. And to Qusay&#39;s corner there has been since Anis Mansour and his days came in the Akkad Salon, but I did not join him in that unique session. And me with him a bitter pause later. In a heterogeneous manner, Bill Gates and a lengthy technical material were with us, a study from me for one of the endless Microsoft technical certificates .. I was confused about where to start and what I commend and who I will triple to him but the opinion settled from the subconscious of the wonderful late Yahya Hakki and his unique Qandil or Hashem In which he made his reputation as a work of the most important works of the short or slightly long story in the twentieth century .. We are here talking about a story written since the forties of the last century and you have always heard about it and read a lot of praise and praise in the books and cultural and literary circulation circulated, and perhaps the most important of those singled out in criticism in That time with a wonderful article is Al Adi By the martyr Syed Qutb, may God have mercy on him, then added to his valuable book: Books and Characters. Until the beginning of this article, it will captivate you and inform you that a flood of praise will spell out this story and this fictional creativity. When Sayyid Qutb opens this article to:. Oh Yahya Hakki ... where are you, man ... I wish I had the executioner&#39;s whip, lazy creator. . Syed continues to list my talents and creativity and compare them to Timur and others .. When he mentions that my right is less productive compared to others, but it is distinguished by type, quality, and talent in this little .. As for Timur, for example, he writes, writes and writes, and he must come across a good thing in this much that he writes. I also remember what the late scholar Mahmoud Shaker Abu Fahr wrote in his valuable book, False and Asmar about that humble man who visited him one day for the first time in his house with a writer and then contacted him later asking him for permission to be his friend and to visit him continuously that was the humble man Adeeb Yahya My right, since they have become close friends since then, and some sources attribute the professorship to Shaker and the apprentice to my right to death, may God have mercy on her in the last decade of the twentieth century .. So all these introductions that I have read, heard and seen about Yahya Hakki and Qandil or Hashem made something inside of me Great about this writer and his production so maybe p Some think that I have made the issue of ruling on it, and it is an easy issue, and it has a look and a blurring upon it. However, really despite all that, I was missing a lot, many, and not the inspector like the informant and anyone who tasted the custom. Every wonderful description about Qandil or Hashem and the smoothness and aesthetics of the language and style of Yahya Hakki Al-Qasasi does not all enrich that description from the moments of his reading and taste. For the first time, I read a story on many of my reading of this literary genre with this wonderful language, the smoothness of words and the splendor of the method that penetrates into the souls of the soul and does its act, for when you read to revive my right and specifically Qandil or Hashem, it is as if you drink water, or sip honey with its ingenuity in language love and draw pictures with ease and elegance Verbal grace .. Qandeel Umm Hashem’s story revolves around that young Ismail, whose rate does not qualify him for admission to local Egyptian colleges, and his father decides to send him abroad in Britain in order to complete his studies and return to a doctor that the family is proud of despite the hardships of distance, separation and financial pressure on the family because of this only With distress .. that villager turns to another man in Britain who bites, befriends, breaks, and also succeeds in his studies and returns to an ophthalmologist, but he is a doctor who revolts against customs, traditions, sophistication, and amulets, defying and praising against the current trend to dare and carry his stick and smash a lamp Hashim, that lamp suspended over the shrine of the lady takes the poor from Its oil to treat their patients with all their diseases and offer gifts and gifts to him .. The result was that the simple people of the neighborhood revolted against him and beat him until he nearly died to be rescued by his former colleague, the guard of the mausoleum and his shepherd .. The young doctor then decides to treat his fiancée, the ruminants in her eyes with his modern form, in which he has recovered dozens in a Britain. But her condition gets worse day by day until she almost lost sight .. In the end the young man reaches the stage of reconciliation between his youth and his traditions and returns to visit the shrine .. The shrine of the lady is not dispensed with his modern treatment .. This is the story in short, which will not make you need to read it of course, but The last sentence, perhaps, summarizing the whole idea of the story, which is dealing with crises of interaction between East and West. Between the backward East that has just looked for the glamor of Western civilization. Between the sight of the West and the insight of the East. Between the mind of the first world, and the spirit of the third world. Between decades and centuries of eastern backwardness and delay, and recent years of superiority and terrible Western scientific progress .. This was the preoccupation of intellectuals and writers of preoccupation in the half of the twentieth century with the era of colonialism and the end of its end, so people were three types :. A class that satisfied the West with its advantages and disadvantages and decided to merge with it and completely strip it of its identity .. It classified completely closed to itself and closed the windows with many arguments until those withered and died .. And an intermediate class between this and that closed the doors as it all opened the windows and received the new with its advantages and disadvantages ... Perhaps this is the last class It is what Yahya Hakki, may God have mercy on him, tried to display and address through the story of this rebellious and confused young man between his traditions and his society who was looking at him with contempt and disgust and then reconciled and appreciated after that after he realized that there is no mind for the West without a soul for the East .. Is this conflict over? I do not think so, and still we are witnessing many civilized traumas who first went to the homes of the West, its universities and institutes to send his speeches from there despising its societies, universities, students, and curricula ... not reconcilable neither with himself nor with his family repeating the same mistakes and negatives. May not benefit his community, even in the end, what he learned and studied. He benefited himself .. quotes. Yahya Hakki formulates and casts all of this with unparalleled linguistic creativity and intellectual creativity. Look at him describing Ismail&#39;s arrival in the steamship to Alexandria after he finished his studies: Why did the ships deliberately make this reluctance to reach, and what was the fastest in separation? Anyone who takes refuge in the arboretum remains a captive of his life. He describes him as Britain and described his girlfriend Mary: The acquaintance has a collision between the two characters, which comes out victorious or loser, the acquaintance has a meeting, and the friendliness is up to the future. He who seeks the morals of angels is overcome by the morals of beasts. These eastern emotions are vicious and hated because they are impractical and unproductive, and if they are stripped of benefit, there remains nothing but their weakness and humiliation. Rather, these emotions have strength in secrecy, not in disclosure. The human soul does not find its strength and then its happiness unless it separates from the masses and confronts them. As for integration, it is weak and resentful. Here, it describes the poor people, and perhaps it describes all the Arab peoples: What is the benefit of jihad in a country like Egypt and with a people like the Egyptians, who have lived in humiliation for centuries, so taste and taste it? This is an old people and returned to their childhood, if someone found it to lead to jumping into manhood again in one step, the road is familiar and glory is old and memories remain. The lover does not measure or compare, and if the comparison is entered from the door and the love passes through the window, here he describes how Ismail reached the stage of conciliation and reconciliation with himself and his community: Where are you, O Light that I have been absent forever? Welcome to you, the blurring of my heart and eyes was gone. I now understood what was hidden from me .. There is no knowledge without faith. He stuck to his knowledge of his spirit and foundation, and left exaggeration in machines and means. He relied on God, then on his knowledge and hands, so God blessed his knowledge and hands. There is not everything in you and me ... there is beauty, secrets, fun and splendor. Al-Saeed is one of her feelings. Then you have to. Between the migration season and the jellyfish. Perhaps Yahya Hakki, son of that lane, did not intend to return to bless those shrines and their oils, but he wanted to convey the idea of reconciling the science with faith, the science of the West with the faith of the East, and he ended it with a happy, bright ending .. Here comes to our minds the story of the migration season to the north by Tayeb Saleh. It deals with the same idea and revolves its contexts on the same topic and the same way with that of the young man leaving the Sudanese village submerged to Britain to study literature to return after the same period of years in Qandil or Hashem and events continue .. but the end of the season
Who am I to comment on the fairies of Barghouti Hussein?
in the name of ALLAH, the most mercifull. The book discusses in several chapters the important tools for reading any book and how one of us can come out with the most benefit from the book. For example, he talks about the types of reading and how to make a good judgment about the book before going into it. On the importance of reading to this nation and why we read at all? And much more. It somewhat ends with my work in the last chapter in history science.
The novel is really beautiful. But it has to be a second part
A wonderful novel with its interesting and tedious narration, and distinguished it in terms of idea and content. Snake and what you realize what snake. Facts I would not have noticed without reading this much fun little book
Beautiful biography. I liked it too. And I hated America more. I liked his willpower

Wonderful. The great cooperation from the reception staff, especially the receptionist, Mr. Ayman. Building operations next to the hotel
I love the thought of this man, may God have mercy on him, wonderful in the market of arguments and evidence, and very interesting and logical
One of the few books that really touched me personally is a high-profile novel
Beautiful family resort. We liked the calmness of the resort and its family faces. I was only with my children, and I did not feel fear, and it contains various games and the level of people in it is sophisticated, even foreigners were mindful that in the pool are children and their going to the seashore to swim and we found our vacation.

Imagine the not-too-distant future of Egypt, where the middle class had completely disappeared. It was replaced by slums among the remains of ancient cities. And away from them are the colonies, where the rich people deceive. The novel reflects reality, but with a lot of extremism and imagination
Spirit. That thing that we did not know what it is, how to prove its existence? It has effects that are known by it, and it remains from the command of my Lord and you only know a little. When I was interested in reading the book, I had several questions, and after I finished it I had come up with more questions.
Very sweet . Thanks a lot. nothing
The second visit to me and the last, God willing. . The same bad technique of delaying procrastination in case the room was not agreed upon had happened to me previously
A light and entertaining book. I enjoyed the hour I read in it, of course, who attracted me to him, why do I discuss more about it? I always talk about it with the generations who are older than me, so I try to prove them that there is no girl with her passing the passport, and this is a share, and if the girl is not required to enter the college, you will start making her a groom and disgrace her And not let her live her life. The important thing is a nice book, and its stories have many similarities to the stories that I remembered in the Hind Sabri series. First review colloquially, but I will not lose sincere :. It is true: colloquial was appropriate, or in the dialogue of the book, if it was the language of Faseeh, you would lose the sense of humor in it: The mod has changed recently.
Hi, the novel made me nullify eating from restaurants unless I work before me. And pity me beggars Choi. Although our hero distinguishes who is actually homeless and who is accused of homelessness
It is a group of stories that I cannot classify as horror stories, but they are miraculous stories of humanistic stereotypical thinking .. They break the routine barrier of the human mind .. Breaking the mathematical principle =
Love is two laughing for the same things, grieving at the same moment, burning and extinguishing together with one sulfur promise, without coordination or agreement.
The place is fine. . Draining shower water
it&#39;s OK . Quiet and clean. I booked a large double bed, and I was surprised that it was not available at that time. They gave me two separate beds, and this was not an agreement between us in the reservation.
The writer was so creative that she ran my mind ... her words flawed my mind, and whenever I remembered her, I couldn&#39;t help but smile ... she learned a lot Maha
A book of his suspense I read in a few hours and I could not stop but at the end of it I strongly recommend reading it
Do you realize, Madonna, before I met you, I was that boy who could not speak to anyone for his shame, and I was burying myself among the pages of books because they were the only ones to understand me. But when I met your picture, I realized that I had been waiting for it for years, and when we met and spoke with you, I gave up my shyness and set out my tongue and spoke, perhaps for the first time, including what is in my heart and unless I had previously told a person before .. You realize, Madonna, I have endured everything from you. On the fact that you do not promise me with love, only friendship only on your terms. But I accepted that because I love you .. Realize you, Madunati, that you took my hand and ascended me to heaven and made me the happiest person in the universe, but destiny differs from our hands and our eyes being tangled, but each of us is on a different path .. It existed before .. But after separating us, that spirit no longer existed inside me and I returned again only to a body that does not care about anything and does not care about anyone and does not care about anything and is afraid of establishing new relationships .. How much I wish you, Madunati, will not happen to us but that is destiny. . A moment may fill a full life
Wonderful ... No matter how many days separate, any lovers are needed in the end, they will be for each other
A story that left me in a state of conflicting feelings. A moment, I finished her last page, I breathed a sigh of relief, and I said finally it was finished. I could not bear more than that ... ever. The novel contains only pain, suffering, injustice, cruelty, and much sorrow and gloom. And what scared me most about it is that it is very realistic to a terrible degree. All the events experienced by the heroes of this novel are only examples and examples of what actually happened in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, it is still happening until now .. There is Mary, Laila and Aziz, and also Rashid somewhere there in the country of Afghans. I am sure that their shadows and voices will chase me for a long time before I forget them. What I liked most about it is Khaled Hosseini&#39;s way of narration and writing, mentioning the details and describing feelings. Unfortunately the translation was not good. Many sentences were missing scattered. And many parts have also been translated literally .. but as a whole, one of the best things that happened between my hands and read it
Excellent worth buying and received in perfect condition, new
Excellent hotel for business trips, it is very quiet and clean as it is close to the airport and this is a good feature in a very busy city like Mumbai
I finished the prayer chemistry series,. Dr. Ahmed Khairy Al-Omari. Untold series. The author started it by saying that whoever bought this book to search for a recipe for reverence, if the recipe was present, would save his money for something else. And the author believed what he wrote. From magnification to peace from prayer, this book will change our usual hereditary conception of true prayer. Perhaps my quotes are few and that is because the writer&#39;s thoughts are interconnected, and if I quote, the concept will be incomplete. /,. All I wish before Ramadan is to read this series with your minds and hearts. Books not exceeding one page and small in size, for only SR. I am not promoting the book but it is really worth reading. We need such books and their method of teaching us
And in the shadows of the Qur’an, I learned that there is no place in this existence for blind chance or for occasional gesture: for everything we have created in so far ... and created everything in appreciation of it .. and every matter of wisdom. But the deep wisdom of the unseen may not be revealed to the short humanistic view. . Love those who emigrated to them and do not find anything in their chests what they gave. The history of all mankind was not known as a collective accident, as was the incident in which Ansar welcomed migrants. With this kind love. With this generous effort. With this satisfied participation, and with this race to harbor and the potential burden. Even to tell that no immigrant landed in Dar Ansari except by lot. Because the number of those wishing to house crowds is greater than the number of immigrants. Life in the shadows of the Qur’an is a blessing that only the one who knows it knows, a blessing that raises, blesses and praises life It is not belief in wish, but what is revered in the heart and its sincerity is action. . The meaning of Islam: surrender and obedience to God’s law, and the meaning of not surrendering to this law, and the adoption of other law in any part of life, is a refusal to recognize the divinity and authority of God, whether this rejection by the tongue or indeed without saying. Do not be afraid that you are the highest. You are right and wrong with them. You have the creed and they have the craft. You have faith in what you are, and have the reward for the match and the spoils of life. You are connected to the superpower and they are serving a mortal creature, no matter how mighty tyrant .. And so we in this life are moving. We are driven by longings and phones, aspirations and greed, and pain and hopes ... and that they are only the very apparent reasons that are implied, and the curtain that the eyes see for the hand that is not seen and not perceived by sight. The hands of the dominant mastermind, Aziz Al-Kahar. . For the sake of the king and the ruler, tyrants do not shy away from committing the most brutal crimes and infamous them with barbarism and keep them away from all the meanings of humanity and from creation, honor and conscience. . The greatest value in God’s balance is the value of belief, and the most popular commodity in God’s market is the commodity of faith
Comfort . The location of the hotel in front of the Kingdom Tower on King Fahd Road. Wi-Fi is very fast. The hotel staff quickly handled parking spaces under the hotel for guests. Frankly, there is nothing that I did not like
This was the second novel he read to Nur Abdul Majeed. In principle, the story is wonderful ... not new, but also not imitated or fabricated. But what distinguished it was the way the writer described the Egyptian classes and made them immensely distant from each other, and this is true, as everyone mixes with what others. Let&#39;s find that the simple girl loves the beaches. I will not dwell on this story, which emerged from nowhere to occupy the middle of the novel. Suffice it to say that it is completely unrealistic. Then it moved from the tragedy of saft al-Laban with all its people, streets and homes, to its roofs and sands. It has taken from those paradoxes, different lives, and the injustice applied to us only and not as a wick that ignited the spark of the revolution. The author also managed to describe how all the people of the nation coalesced against corruption and injustice. She made it very clear who was against this revolution and also what might these people do in order to get what they want. The semen is very hard, especially the residents of Saft al-Laban. The writer embodied a painful reality that we all live in today. In order to make a living, you have to do the impossible. She was given the novel is good but lacking rhetorical expressions
Bilal Fadel does not stop surprising me ...
A very wonderful book, and I summarize my comment, quoting from the author, that this book elevates your faith from the birth faith to the faith of certainty.
The book is a solution. I am one of the people that fell in love with the soldier&#39;s style of terror. But I couldn’t know that he has a great talent for comedy. One of the first gifts and I am already laughing. The story of your loved one really makes me laugh. This was the sweetest one of them in Nessbali. And the rest was satisfactory
I enjoyed his language very very much. Me update. And a greater review, God willing
Nice and comfortable stay. Everything is beautiful in the hotel and I liked it a lot and we have an overwhelming occasion and we worked it in the hall except for them and they made it for us as an excellent hall and the arrangement and coordination are very excellent.
Finish it now. Angry at my stupidity, this has become his habit ... He steals my heart beats, my facial expressions steals my mind ... He always ends it without giving me any answer ... Leaving the matter to my mind to put an end to his satisfaction..It seems that he knows that my mind always puts the ugliest ends ... Well it seems that this increases his satisfaction
good. The location is excellent, close to the mall and games city. Breakfast is good. Clean room is good. The receptionist treats room temperature not working
good. The staff is excellent and fast in providing service and place arrangements. Entering and leaving the hotel due to the presence of business beside and the large number of large cars, dust and adjacent construction work. The inability to go to the Dubai Mall on foot due to business and closures, and that was not mentioned to me when booking, knowing that I was very interested in this point and it was unfortunately counterproductive.
An interesting book explaining the many events and motives behind it, it answered many questions about the revolutions
Terrible after I read this novel, I was surprised to find ISIS in Syria
Residence at. Comfortable, practical, great location, good services. The swimming pool is cold. Transportation to the mall is low. The restaurants in the hotel are very expensive. TV control is very complicated
good. . Reception is very poor. Reservation was not found through Bunkink until after more than an hour, knowing that the email confirmation of the reservation was provided. Reception staff are weak.
very good. The hotel is very beautiful and has no dispute. The furniture is old, and I’m a guest with them, everything I got to know about Dubai, and for those who work for me, any price reduction, knowing that I have lived in the hotel more than once
Luck agreed and shook hands with me with his hand that carries this novel in his hands. Really I shook hands with luck. The most wonderful Arab novel I read until now. I have not regret, nor for a moment, that I have read it, or that its lines attracted me to its fragrance, the aroma of olives, and the smell of ancestors in ancient Granada. Really, the writer created.
It is somewhat sweet to eat
I did not expect a literary end to the novel, and its conclusion did not surprise me without closing .. The novel portrays the fate of events in Egypt. And it is the dark fate that Egypt followed in the novel and also runs outside it .. The characters of the novel were each symbolizing an entity, institution or stream. But it was devoid of anyone representing political Islam. Ezzeddine Shoukry directed his criticism of all players in the arena in the sins of his heroes .. The novel is literally enjoyable, disturbing as a possibility that can happen on the ground.
I love travel literature very much
good . Excellent location, quiet and comfortable place, flexible check-in and check-out. Wi-Fi outages constantly, reception staff need to increase communication skills with guests, weak TV channels, there is a hookah cafe, but it is intended for families, knowing that I, as a guest, have the right to benefit from all services
Excellent . Hygiene and comfort. Internet is not free, it is only free in public places and is very slow
Wonderful, I hope you win the poker prize
Not described in quantities
Exceptional. Breakfast is very great, wide selection and excellent popular food. Great views of the Kaaba. There are no instructions to reach the sanctuary.
Flight is:. The location of the housing design is innovative and gentle. The washing machine was down
I read this book in the morning and finished it on the same day in the evening, and if that indicates something, it indicates the writer&#39;s ability to attract you, and a testimony of the extent to which this narrative can stretch its reader and make him live with the hero in all the events that he went through ... the beauty of this The novel does not only lie in the sequence of its events, and the smoothness of its language ... Rather, it lies in making you review yourself ... in those situations where you were racist in one way or another without awareness and awareness ... and other situations that you passed through in your childhood when you saw the same features Asiatic, she speaks the Kuwaiti dialect fluently and surprised, and here she asks, perhaps this person paid attention to the features of surprise. Maybe he made a scar inside, maybe he hurt him? We have forgotten some religious aspects in our daily life related to the lack of distinction between people, and equality to remind us of this narration and make us bemoan over a previous civilization that was a pinnacle of morals, and at the same time made us strive to be better ... I did not regret reading this narration.
good. The pool was very cool. The rooms are relatively small and the brush colors are quite disappointing
The novel is fascinating in its language. But the colloquial dialect in it may have degraded her language. I am a fan of the romantic novel. However, the novel caused me a kind of sadness and frustration. Jumana&#39;s weakness in front of her boyfriend provoked me. But love has authority, and that is why I understand Jumana&#39;s weakness
I was happy to choose the Four Season, and I will repeat the reservation later. God willing. Location, luxury, quick service. The high price of the restaurant
Exceptional. Excellent and located in Baniyas Square. The internet is very weak
The struggle between good and bad. But did the good really triumph? Did they not kill Berta because they repented and the good won in them, or did they not kill her because they could not spend the gold? Next time, dear evil, use the money directly
I read it twice and I will read it third, fourth and fifth
good. Plenty of parking free internet near the supermarket Distance from new commercial centers such as Dubai Mall and Emirates Mall
Vocabulary of Al-Otoum, its language and style The most beautiful part is the messages ... an incomplete star because the end is normal and expected .. I was the best in a surprising end .. Also, some internal dialogue between the characters was traditional. But it remains to oppress his silence
Above description is excellent. Honestly excellent. nothing
The language of the book is beautiful, interesting to read ..
The book is very sweet, I don’t like the short stories sincere because I don’t live and live in it and merge in it, but I felt in the book that every story merges easily with it and lives the narration style is sweet all the time. I feel that the hero speaks to me and tells me, except that the sweet link between all the stories is all It has the same spirit and they must remain in the same book. You will not feel that there is a need for a possible increase in God. If it fails, we will not feel it. Almost all the stories are strong, and each one has an influential role, although the connection between them is strong. The most important story related to the metro has transported me to a world that already exists, but we do not see it. Life is the role every day. The metro is the people that we meet with their details. The reading does not feel very pure. This is the first book to provide a very professional book. Greetings to Tasnim on this wonderful book
Excellent. . Annoyingly narrow parking for large cars
My first experience with Kundera, and certainly not the last, will be with him for other long sessions. His style of the novel is very unique, the way the narration and its overlapping is terrible. He says the novel in one of the passages by Kundera himself: It means that the novel must be unquote. Meaning that they are all integrated. And another point about the difference between the road and the road. On the road, the road itself does not matter, but it is important to get from point A to point B. Or the path is its importance as a path, and the path itself is to be an end. The sense is not just access. This thing summarizes his style with this novel. It does not matter where it begins, how it ends and what will happen. By reading it you will know that every page and perhaps every sentence of its own has value. And this is his view of the art of the novel, it is not like a movie waiting for what will happen, but rather you must feel that for every moment and every page there is something itself and a goal. ... I will definitely have other sessions with Kundera when I devote myself a little
As usual, Al-Rafii is a difficult language for the rest of the books, but it is wonderful, and some of you feel drunk in the world of imagination and the description that takes you to it ... What I liked most was the text of Sheikh Ahmed and the two youngsters, and in his last text he turned from describing love and splendor to description. His pain and made him a door of hell on the ground because of the severity of the torture in him ...
Peace, war: Years of conflict. We did not complain about the dispute. We did not know the taste of the loss. Or losing food ... security was not disturbed by fear. He does not walk back to the front ... everything was like clockwork ... regularly. Here is an enemy army ready to storm ... Here is an army of a regime ready to take revenge ... From here we hear bullets being fired ... From here we hear the launching of words ... And on the tune we were every year. We are not being born on the soul of a martyr. We sleep .. and without waiting. She married a thunderbolt. Earthquake Harmony. So we enlightened us in the darkness, washed us with soot, and took cover in the bathroom. After we were witnesses, they became ours. The subject of the accusation .. Tomorrow, the enemy army will throw us to the ground. In order to slaughter the army of order. Come again, war, let us live in peace
I loved this novel very much, and I enjoyed it a lot as I gradually moved between its seasons from Claudio&#39;s childhood to his maturity, and I liked more that it was that simple, like depicting a routine, almost life-free routine. Among the lines I felt a lot that I had traveled to Spain, where Claudio lived, he started with the city he used to live in, the neighborhood, the street, the house, his room and the fig tree. I lived with him and with interest in the details of his life and stages and attracted me to that more, being a painter and a lover of reading, and contented himself with his small surroundings. I used to see myself a lot in these matters.
Here, I was struck by a poet cry that had brought pain alive, so I cried with it and breathed pain and revolution over the spiritual, psychological and physical imprisonment I tasted .. Fatima, with my own eyes, was not rebellious against religion but rebellious against the male slapping hand that sanctifies the man and makes the woman a slave. If there is a deficiency in us, then what is perfect for you, and perfection was for God alone? The woman’s knowledge and work is not a denial or a shame, even if our arrogant orientation insists on making it so .. I am fascinated by the prose poem and more fascinated by her love for her ... Buthina’s talk about poetry and writing in general is a sweet torment like a beautiful spinning with his thicket .... an easy loose language that is prose A caravan that cares about holding it, so what you keep escaping from your fingers is a challenge and a bravery. I did not give the fifth star because I wished that Fatima had defeated Falcon with her headscarf and commitment at the end of the novel.
Wow, if I hadn&#39;t felt bored in some places, he&#39;d have the ability to get you back to read until you finish it
A wonderful book with historical information shocking the continent. Dr. Yusef Zidan tries to prove the complementarity of the divine religions and explains the reasons for the theological difference between the three religions and between the parties of one religion. Demonstrates the relationship of religious influence and religious beliefs to history, customs and traditions. At the end of the book, it explains the relationship between religion and politics, and between them and violence. A very useful book and I need the second reading
very good. I liked the cleanliness of the room, quietness and location. Disabling my check-in at reception means that you come from a long distance and want to rest and break down at the reception
I lived with the story with a sincere feeling and was affected by every stage it went through, whether with love or with jealousy and suspicion that almost killed him with a wonderful novel by all standards.

Those who raise up about Islamic education have overlooked the most important aspect of it .... The tragedy of Muslims lies in the fact that they neglected the science of faith and its path, which is the innate introduction to the Book of God. Faith is not inherited. And the discerning of the educators sends those who pledge them on that journey, looking and thinking and thinking, so if they believed their belief was based on the principles and experiences established in their conscience, and increased the grace of reason in appreciation and use .. This first book in the series of the three origins of the writer God, the Messenger and Islam, I chose it also To be the first reading material on my own trip. To reassure my heart . , Along with many reading, audio and visual materials .. This book helped me in drawing the milestones of my journey and setting its initial cognitive framework, contenting myself with some of what I singled out in detail and detailing it in some of the chapters, and looking for what is more beautiful in its narration from other chapters. Also, my reading of parts of the book helped me more than once to determine what would require me more research and study in my own leg .. The book is a compilation and compilation of what was written by the previous ones, the writer collects his parts and comments on them in a sequence that began with. Determining the path of the mind to know the divine self. Then he presented a set of major cosmic phenomena that indicate God. Then the significance of these phenomena indicates the names and attributes of God and the linking of what the mind has attained with what we have reported with the transfer .. Then comparing the Islamic belief with other beliefs of religions and the attitudes of philosophers .. The book was as if it were a summary of the research of its owner in this aspect and extracts of what he reached in his research journey is .. I think A good and happy start for another trip, starting from here. To reassure my heart . ... God is the helper:
Excellent hotel. Close to the Haram, they offered to leave late until 5 pm. The absence of guidance boards to reach it. The cost of parking the car is very high, per night
I liked the hotel very much and its price is great. I liked the price of the hotel for the service.
Comfortable hotel. everything. There is no
Excellent. everything. There is no place for families at breakfast, but you can have breakfast in the room
The book is very beautiful, Salman Al Awdah&#39;s style is calm, pleasant and stimulating. He tried to go back and navigate us within ourselves through the content of the book, talked about the ego and its desires, weaknesses and strengths, and talked about love, work, imagination, addiction, shame and fear..etc. I felt that Al-Awdah wrote this book for a beautiful goal as the beauty of himself, which is to make happy lives as possible for everyone who reads it, with his insistence hidden between the lines of this desire. :
Ajman. Sauna, Jacuzzi and Steam Bath. Beach lock at night and restaurant lock
Numerous needs can be said from this book from the beginning of the title and the story that he saw, then two simple comparisons in style, but deep in the meaning and examples that are distinguished by Dr. Khaled Abushadi.
Delicious sea food. We visited the restaurant for lunch. The food was excellent. The session was simple and comfortable. I will definitely visit the restaurant again, God willing.
I am sitting too long to know how to write a comet, and I know how to make blackness and realism that I entered from the hour I started with many details and I am convinced that they will return to the forest and the emperor will succeed and slavery will return to his home, although every step was to change the features of all the characters and keep them miles away from Their first soul, and they also know that dreams and love are never enough to resist blackness, injustice, death and killing. Almost literally from a literary point, Muhammad Al-Mansi Qandeel is one of the greatest writers who can write historical events in a literary form that is enjoyable, powerful and influential, passing through all that I have made for him, except for I have loved
Really cool, she tells the history of nearly seventy years that China has lived through the lives of three women. I don&#39;t know what to say. I got to know more about communism and the cultural revolution .. I recommend reading it ... and with intensity
This book is one of the first books that I have read, a very beautiful book, and the style of the writer is wonderful and classy, the introduction to the book is the closest to my heart the book talks about personalities that deserve to be men about the Messenger prophet Muhammad peace be upon him.
Love has five fingers ... Five strings in my hand ... It is your first birth, dear ... You fill me with astonishment whenever you read a text to me or remember how to delay the joys of meeting. Whenever I remember how surprised you fill my heart, the joy I used to delay to meet your fingers. Congratulations, my little girl, my friend, my wife ..
good . On reception staff, the bed is comfortable. Wi-Fi is weak
Hide the bitch and strips all men ..
One of the most wonderful things I have read ... I have a wonderful ability for the author to tell the events in an interesting and distinctive way and also a wonderful ability to describe the characters, which makes you live the events and perceive it as if you are living it yourself
Time for white horses. One of the most beautiful books that I have read and read in my life. Loving novels whose successive events are in it for the grandfather, family, family, children and grandchildren, what do you think about her people and her characters remaining on Palestine about the usurped country and on the resistance. You don&#39;t have to start with their description of the horses that are the most beautiful and the finest animal from my point of view, how do they do this? How do they dress like their daughter? How do they get married? How do they keep them? I want pigeon, reddish, red, or UA, or I felt like I was wearing a petal for a horse. The last painful part at the end of the painful and painful narration in it is that until now the situation is sad. The village that I felt was born, watered, and dying with each person, my house is their home, and in the midst of them it burns in my painful end, as much as the pain that they will give to its people. It&#39;s life. Can you give me an end without an end? The end is the beginning? The beginning is the beginning? A wonderful
good. People smile when entering and exiting the hotel gate. Pigeons do not conform to Islamic customs
Great resort, with average food, I just returned from my five-day stay at Grand Rotana Sharm El Sheikh. The resort is nice, quiet, peaceful and warm; excellent for families and couples. With a giant pool, a heated children&#39;s pool, a nice waterslide and an outdoor jacuzzi pool with sea views. My luxurious sea view room was very impressive, and the housekeepers and reception staff in particular were very pleasant. My only major problem was with the quality of food and service in the main restaurant Ramses. The food never reflects the quality of this hotel. It was below average, without luxury decks and with very poor service. My package included bed and breakfast, and I&#39;m mainly talking about breakfast here. Anyway, I tried the food in this restaurant at dinner, and it was very bad. In any case, the Italian food in Mezzaluna was good. My other minor problem was the TV channels. Although they have an acceptable range of channels, I tried to add two MBC MBC Action which are essential in the Middle East, but I could not. They told me that the channel list is fixed and cannot be changed. Another minor problem, the shuttle bus that visits Naama Bay three times a day for free, which was a wonderful thing times is not flexible. Morning, four o&#39;clock in the evening and then in the evening there should be at least a bus at six, seven or eight in the evening for Naama Bay, in my opinion in general, the resort is a great destination for those seeking relaxation. You should try it sometime.
This novel constituted a qualitative shift in my thinking and to the extent of its beauty and grandeur, I made her fight against a great deal of misery and sadness ... A great Dostoyevsky knows that he communicates what he wants to the heart of his reader, not, but rather he wreaks his words on his chest until he reaches his heart.
Bifurcated beginning to the beginning of the beginning, as the writer called it, joins with a genius plot that forms the top of the pyramid. I lived as if it was a movie and all that was on my mind now when I buy the second part to complete the novel&#39;s events, because it is amazing
A special enjoyable stay for families .... A spacious place.
A wonderful, impressive novel that takes the soul .... with its many, intertwined details and events, but it is at the height of suspense
Imagination has no limits, so I go with imagination to what you have no boundaries
good. Services. Daily cleaning. Swimming pool. Jim Coyce. Situations. A side of a grocery store opens an hour. The internet is fast and fast. Extra bed price b per day. Hygiene does not feel it
You were the most beautiful in my trip. Everything is great and the response from the hotel crew is special .. Honestly, I found in the hotel unless I found it in the five stars .. And I thank the wonderful professor Hatem for the wonderful treatment he is all the staff ...
Literature, painful, realistic, magh ... teaches you how to laugh to pain and pain to laugh
good. Its price is very reasonable ... there is no supermarket or grocery store close to it.
It deserves universality ... It takes you to the world that people always mention but you did not see ... With this narration you see it ...
Hard novel, heartache
Exceptional. Location, location, service and cleanliness. The lobby is small
The most beautiful stay. All services are excellent, I wish more development for the hotel. There is no
The stay is enjoyable, the front desk service is excellent, fast and good reception, they have an interest in the guest very well, and the general view of the rooms is enjoyable on one side, the restaurant service is excellent, the food is excellent, the cleanliness of the rooms is excellent, and the smell is beautiful. I thank the first-aid man in the hotel. You have excellent room service in delivering requests to the room.
Happy vacation in Dubai. Excellent in general and excellent service. The rooms at Al Wasl do not have any welcome from fruits and some drinks, and there is no daily newspaper to send to the rooms in the morning, and I called no one.
The book is more artwork than literary, where the writer managed to narrate the accidents of driving and taxi in a manner that reflects the reality of life in his environment and his society, which is the reality of other societies
He is a Nizar, he brought together the Damascene jasmine, the woman and the homeland ... I do not know which of them loves my heart, his spinning hair or the political .. With a little scrutiny, you find that he treated the woman as if it was a homeland, and the nation was treated like a woman .. And that was always the poet of political and sometimes forbidden spinning .. By the way, one of my three friends is one-sided
A novel that attracted me and concluded it in the hours of Bazakh and I read it, although its events are quiet, but it attracts you very much, but it is a sad novel in general. You discover discovering the characters in a beautiful way. But, on certain points, I used to sense the writer about it, but without explanation, as the first novel by Bravo. The speech is smooth and not vocal, that is, the word is out
There are many visions and many writings, confirming that Islam recommends good deeds to women and depicts them metaphorically with fluffy flasks calling for attachment to them, so it places them under the guardianship of the man, making him a degree over the woman, but he is higher than it is because he is the one whom God has preferred and he who inherits weakness or Everyone, who is complete with reason, religion and religion, and his highest position is not only religious, but also his religious woman in the hereafter, and he also has other women: Hur eye is like the pearls of the hidden, did not touch them before man and no jean, whenever he assumed their virginity Aden virgins, and there is no consolation here for the women There is no room, therefore, for their succession on earth from God. It is unreasonable for God to represent a woman on earth, regardless of her status ... her position, whatever it may be, should degrade the position of a man, at least to a degree, and by more than one degree at times, and by all degrees at times. Our saying of honoring Islam for women is the biggest lie that does not exist ... Islam, like other religions that despised women and considered them the bowl of men and their product for their children, no more
Chapter on the privacy of the word and analogy of Imad Abi Saleh. I&#39;ll write it someday
Proximity to the sanctuary. Close to the campus. Small size of rooms
Excellent. . The staff as a whole was excellent, but upon check-in there was an employee who needed visitor handling skills because his style was not good
This book is a belligerent enemy from the books that affected me a lot ,,, consisting of more than four hundred pages, ,,,,, British writer of nationality and Pakistani origin ,,, tells in this book his story when they arrested him in Guantanamo Bay ,,,, To help the Afghans during the war and collect donations for them to overcome the drought at this time ,,,, I touched in his words of honesty ,,, and I liked very his behavior with what he experienced severe events ,,,, and his self-control ,,, ,, Of the Muslims he is really proud of ,,,,, he has mastered about seven foreign languages ,,,,,, he has a lot of a lot of cultures and information ,,, and his story in short. Beg moved to Afghanistan with his family before returning to Pakistan in the year with the start of the American war on Afghanistan .. He was arrested in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, in the year before his transfer to Guantanamo .. He was released with three British citizens, and all returned to the United Kingdom He wrote his story when he was in his thirties, but when I looked for him more, I learned that he is now close to forty-five years old and that he is still accused of terrorism for aiding the Syrians during their crisis ,,,,,, surprising them ,,, And surprising you, most flushing
It talks. That two lovers. In an old time. We were buried in one hole. Imagine the scene: Two skeletons. Lying side by side. As if dirt is a bed of grass. Worms that excrete cold meat. Butterflies carry kisses in their nectar. Were they killed? They committed suicide together. Or are they victims of cholera? Ignore the narrators. Through the ages. These transit details. To shine. In the story. Red Rose. Germinated. From the soil that embraced the lovers in a last hug. The roots of the bones of their fingers. Interlocking in death. As in life
Excellent. Everything, especially hygiene.
Oh God, wonderful. I would like to speak more
My knowledge of the artist, Nabil, started when we at the university, I think in his year / Nabil was in her first year in civil engineering ... I know about him that he is a first-class artist and artist .... analyst .... light shadow ... hinted .... Ibn Nokta ... He is ready to do a real-time analysis of any personality or any situation in a record time .... It has beautiful qualities that cannot be described in words and text like this country .... Nabil has the capabilities that with his words and description he can raise you above or It degrades you under his meticulous, intelligent description .. his personality bears the qualities that are above that nothing can be produced like the book of the Pyramids of Friday and it is not at the highest level of quality and workmanship .. I have a defect defects in the most accurate sense which is that I I don’t like poetry and I don’t imagine that I hold a poetry book and read it voraciously and enjoy it while I read it like this ... Rather I read sections of it to my wife ... I mean as if I enjoy something and want to share with the people I love .. I tried reading some pages randomly ... I mean open The book that comes up in the hands of I read it ... This was with the aim that I find a loophole or need for its blood. It was dismissed in the book .... But I failed .... I failed to find one line with an unpalatable taste ... The whole book is not excellent ... No This is more than wonderful, and most important of all, it is for all age groups, but the important thing is that he is an Egyptian or a lover of Egypt and the atmosphere of Egypt .. The only negative side of my face, my humble opinion, is in the form of a question. Is the brother And non-Egyptians, can they understand our colloquial language? .... If the answer is in the negative, unfortunately, my analysis remains true and hard, so they will not enjoy the book as I enjoyed it, and therefore they should learn our accent, or that my brother Nabil takes this into consideration in the upcoming works, God willing ..... Nabil .... Good luck .... may God grant you success and honor you on all social, practical, personal, and family levels, and ... your big brother / Abdel-Gawad Mandy or as you wish Abgawad
Four dialogues for which Plato Socrates specializes, the dialogues in their entirety are wonderful, evoke the mind and urge him to think, research and ask, all dialogues begin with introductions on the tongue of Socrates and end with either negative results to criticize one of the misconceptions from Socrates ’point of view, especially Plato or positive to support an idea they believe in .. Why not I like in the introductions that the repeated delivery is very much in the responses of those who are interviewed by Socrates, which appears in the repetition of a group of vocalizations. Examples are yes, it is correct, I think you are right, Socrates, there is no disagreement, no doubt, certainty, no doubt about that, very true, yes this What I might imagine and other amusing signs The full introductions that Socrates proposes and in my imagination if there was some objection to these introductions with logical opinions as is the style of Socrates, the outcome of the dialogues could have been much richer, with the exception of some responses from Simias and Sebaceus in the Phaedo dialogue, so they had some objections that contributed to enriching those The interview a lot .. There are also introductions that the translator, clever Naguib Mahmoud recounted for each interview separately. I think that it is better to have subsequent comments for each conversation in order not to lose on the reader the pleasure of the dialogs themselves .. The Etofron interview most of its results are negative to criticize certain ideas about piety and I would have preferred to have The result of any Abate to define piety in the eyes of Socrates and Plato .. The defense dialogue is better to call it pleading and not the dialogue because Socrates dwells on it in defense of itself, and there was no dialogue except in the narrowest limits ... The dialogue of the Qataris I liked and disagreed with on one side only when I imagine the laws and blame him for He escaped the death sentence in a hypothetical dialogue in which the laws accused him of treason because he was satisfied with them and accepted them even if he was sentenced after that to flee from their rule, and the essence of my difference here is that he does not flee from them or from their rule, but if he had accepted fleeing then he escapes from the injustice of the applicable law And not from them, how many valid laws are fulfilled Dam from the misuse of its implementers, because the effect of Socrates escaping at the time did not involve him from betraying the laws in anything, and this is my opinion. The last dialogue, which is the discussion of Fidon, is the most beloved and most interesting one to myself. Plato in it, on the tongue of Socrates, excelled in proving the immortality of the soul. New, and thus, the one soul rotates over several bodies in many times, and the idea of learning and knowledge in its reality is nothing but a reminder of what the soul has acquired in its first world and in the lower world, it is a truly inspiring idea that made me wonder about what kind of spirit inhabited me who was in the past, and made me Also imagine that spirits It is only a very limited number that alternates and regenerates in the bodies in an endless cycle, and the dialogue also raised the idea of succession of opposites that Plato believed a lot. In the end the book is creamy and worth reading again
Once your voice came from afar. I was a strange tourist in a strange country. I tried to see you as I wanted you to be. The sky of Haifa was rainy .. and I was not there. I envied you
A small book in its size, but it was valued
One of the most beautiful historical novels that I have read in my life and I do not know how I have not read it for a long time, so Mnif writes in great detail and extravagance of beauty and has a very wonderful ability to control a very large number of characters .. The novel describes the situation of the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula before the discovery of oil to the stages of the start of exploration On oil and the mixing of the Bedouins with the Americans, and even working with them in the company that I think is Aramco .. I think that a wonderful work like salt cities should be studied in schools, not to prevent and transform into a scenario presented by a creative director, so the written material is easy to turn into a huge and large TV work Continues for a large number of episodes .. I have salty A single note that aroused my surprise during my reading is when the Bedouin thought that the sport carried out by the Americans is a prayer that was very surprising for humans to think on the face of the creature a prayer? Especially since the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, who are supposed to be Muslims, are aware of the noble hadiths or the sayings of the Companions. Has Islam not encouraged sport? In short: This is how history is told in a novel ..: //. . //
I finished reading Hadayek Al-Ahzan book, Iran and Wilayat al-Faqih by researcher Mustafa al-Labbad. An important and very useful book in terms of information, content and content. The book focuses specifically on the concept and origins of the wilayat al-faqih theory and its primary role in the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran at the hands of Khomeini ... a book that is neutral. It also provides a remarkable traceability to the evolution of the theory of wilayat al-faqih historically and politically. It is considered an introduction to understanding Iranian politics and the principle of wilayat al-faqih. Then it shows the meaning of the guardianship of the jurist and the role of Imam Khomeini in developing this theory and the arrival of the system of guardianship of the jurist to power and the exclusion of all parties and other political currents where the line of disagreement and the origin of governance according to the theory of guardianship of the jurist: God is the Messenger the Messenger text the Imam Public Prosecutor of the Jurist. And since the existence of the Ahl al-Bayt is no longer clear, and since the scholars are the heirs of the prophets, then the Shi’ite religious establishment is responsible for leading the Islamic nation represented by the wilayat al-faqih. And it sheds light on the transfer of power after Khomeini&#39;s death to Khamenei, then explains the role of former President Khatami in developing religious discourse, especially the enlightening philosophical side and its failure on the economic side. neutral. I recommend reading it
How strange is this selfish person, whose conscience is alive only after it is too late.
Simple reading in Why not read if you did not watch the movie .... The movie you should watch more than once because its events are very complicated and I have seen it until now within the limits of times and there are still things absent from me and I did not find an explanation for it Donnie Darko complex and uses a lot Of medicines and walking during his sleep a large and frightening rabbit comes to him named Frank and asks him to follow him and tell him that the world will end after a day and the reason for this is the plane engine that his mother and his sister in the future crashes through the black hole and arrives in the Donny room, which as we said saved him Frank from death by making him follow because of the fall of this engine from the future is another world that will continue for a day and a day He is lost and ends with him, the basic world that is stopping because the black hole will swallow it leads Frank who later knows that he is just a teenager wearing a costume that denies a rabbit in order to commit several things to make his mother and sister ride this plane, so the engine will fall into the black hole again and shut down forever of course This is part of the main story. Also, there is a love affair between Gretchen and Donnie and it encourages him to do this dangerous task in which he can lose his life in this very modest explanation. Just a small lines of the main axis of the movie that you must watch until you understand it.
Cute and smooth and sends important messages to all parties.
My first choice to stay in the news. The rooms are very spacious and the location of the hotel. The hotel style is old and breakfast is not renewed
Top hotel in magnificence, tranquility, quick service and excellent breakfast. I liked the speed in responding to cleaning the room and breakfast. It was delicious. There are people who speak the Arabic language. This is above the excellent. The hotel is very nice and he has to talk about it .. Increase TV channels for movies
This is actually classified under the Holy Books.
Excellent. The hotel in general is very beautiful. Interface problem with the speed of the laundry&#39;s response to taking clothes
Good. Location. The Internet with fees and weak after the furniture needs renewal
A hotel worth trying. Really great hotel, stars, reception staff, smiling, and services to the fullest extent, especially Omar or Ammar Arab nationality, the room service is great, the cleanliness is excellent, and the security is at a high level. Radisson Royal. The presence of a night club or restaurant that works daily at the hotel on the fourth floor and the entrance for visitors with the entrance of the residents and the same turnip serves everyone and every star hotel these advantages are the absence of a bidet in the rooms
May God grant you success. . Far and no breakfast
I loved the sincerity and smoothness of the language despite the pain and ugliness of the viewer .. The author transmitted her psychological fluctuations from the beginning of the revolution in an amazing way. And the viewer transmitted with realism mixed with great poetry.
This small-sized novel of passion, lavish beauty and full of delicate metaphors and poetic passages and deep short dialogues, the novel tells the story of the fisherman who became the great poet postman for Nobel Literature Pablo Neruda, the love of the postman and his life that changed completely after approaching the glow of poetry and adoration, The story of the fishermen’s village, which represents life in Chile, between Allende’s victory in the presidency and the left’s accession to power and the coup that the poet died days later.
I was very impressed with the non-classical structural style of Ahmad Murad, but his description of what goes on in his imagination when he used to be was very cliche ... his imaginary pictures I could not see or approach even ... I liked the phases of the story ... I liked the way Ahmed made me doubt everything .. An excellent novel. Were it not for the imaginary wandering, the five stars would have been deserved
Mustafa Mahmoud takes the reader&#39;s hands and makes him sail across lines. At first glance, it seems that they are not connected, and then you discover that all of them are combined. It is a mystery of death. An amazing book that combines philosophy with scientific theories. And a lot of spirituality unexpectedly.
Excellent . Its strategic location, its proximity to the Great Mosque of Mecca, and transportation to and from the Sanctuary. There is no
Best hotel. Very beautiful site and elegant deal.
Excellent. The location is very excellent, the staff is very good, courteous and the room is very quiet and comfortable. Little plumbing should be taken care of, ceiling paints and an increase in the number of tissue boxes in each room
The Book of the Prophet by Gibran Khalil Gibran Jamil raises you in understanding human values..love, work, education, giving, joy and sadness, good and bad..etc. Emotional book is very beautiful ..
I am greatly integrated in every part of the novel. The writer takes you to worlds of suspense, horror and imagination mixed with beautiful poetic language. The child’s families in the novel and the dolls and strings held by it made me feel that each of us was subjected to a conspiracy in his life in the school where creativity was destroyed Or in the street from which naughtyness learned us, we are all captured at a time of frustration and the production of old copies
When you read the point of view of the two parties ... the issue is totally different and opinions and rulings differ with him.
A brilliant genius
good. . The room was on the ground floor and was annoyed
Wonderful and distinctive The restaurant is wonderful from decor, cleanliness and arranging the sessions ,,, there is a games room for children with a TV ,,, many sessions with or without barriers ,,, eating varied and delicious and fresh ,,, I liked the sushi the rest of the food is delicious ,,, and the staff are very adorable and the services ,,,
Ideal for changing the routine style of most hotel decorations. The elegant design, colors and decor give rise to calm and romance, which is what you find in all corners of the site. Close to City Center and from all services. It may be because of the crowding though, it only takes less than a few minutes to check in and check out in general. A hotel will be one of my destinations for upcoming visits.
It is very nice to understand the stories of the Noble Qur’an and learn ... There are many stories that I did not know ... a book that greatly redeemed me and opened my eyes to things that were absent from my mind.
Exceptional. The location and the large area of the apartment and bathrooms, God bless you and the corridors Underground parking is difficult to enter and exit
One is confused about the classification of this novel. Her name may sound like a romantic novel. And with the beginning of the novel, we find events enveloped in mystery. And with penetration into the events of the novel more we find wonderful human glimpses. The novel that sparked my curiosity to read more works of this creative writer. A novel that explores the depths of the human psyche with its problems, ambitions, ambiguity and suffering. Your problems may lead you to despair, hopelessness, suicide. But only you can change the course of his life to where he wants, even if it seems difficult to change. Even if fate seems to manipulate you and lead your life completely towards a certain path. The problems, suffering and pain presented by the writer in the novel by its characters. Which they were able to overcome with will and determination. It makes you wonder: Can a person go through worse than this? How if we despair and turn away and melt our will? . Shots in it and various scenes made me cry. I cry because some of her messages shocked me in my heart. As if written specifically for me ... the style of the writer is beautiful and likenesses as well. The choice of names in the novel was successful because I hate long names and do not memorize them:. Because I love you ... Mark Layla told her about his isolation and suffering. Nikon told her repeatedly to Mark with her tongue, her heart, and her deed. Effie told her to Connor with her actions and future that she had put in his hands. Connor told her to Effie by standing by her side and not giving up. Five stars with appreciation
My usual hotel. I always like cleanliness and hospitality.
Very beautiful hotel. A very very beautiful hotel. Apartments are spacious and suitable for families. There is no
Beautiful and wonderful hotel. . The buffet was not up to expectations
very good. The breakfast breakfast forgot an item in the apartment and they informed me about it before I left. The washing machine does not work well. There is no bidet in the bedroom bathroom
Slavery will not cease to exist .. for every age of slavery and slaves. . Today there is no east .. Rather, it is a forest on its trees. A monkey wears the costume of the West without order, arrangement, understanding or awareness. . Where are you now, O wise. Here is your words applied in our time. The first reading of al-Hakim, but I think that this novel is definitely the best that has been written. I felt like reading a translated work in a special style. With great philosophical thought. A beautiful start to me with Tawfiq Al-Hakim
nice view . The most beautiful thing about the hotel is the view of the Burj Khalifa and the dancing fountain. The pool is very small and the breakfast is of average standard
very good. The location is great and close to the sanctuary.
The novel is very beautiful, very woven, and its end is completely unexpected ... the most beautiful thing I read to Ibrahim Issa, the truth is .... it was worthy of poker, and God
Alaa Al-Aswany in this book touched a lot of the human strings inside me .. He was able to alert me to many of the things that I had overlooked or known and I cannot express on the human level. Anecdotal sets are not without wonderful human touches and smoothly it delivers the idea to you and makes you live the context of the story .. Even writing it to Essam Abdel Ati&#39;s papers feels that you see Essam Abdel Ati a lot in every place you go to, but you can say if you stand a sincere position In front of yourself that you were or are still model Essam Abdel Ati in one way or another on one level or another .. It is the embodiment of an Egyptian young man who tasted the bitter with all the meaning of the word, whether it deals with those who are going theoretically according to the principles of their religion and the separation of their reality from the state of religiousness that he calls In addition to his harsh conditions and all the suffering he went through throughout his life. This is a collection of anecdotes that you should read ... may come close ... and know. The introduction to the book is very wonderful and very rich in its intellectual material .. I am talking about the new edition of this collection of stories, which contains the old and new introduction
Action . I thank Brother Abdul Majeed for working at the reception. The future employee who works at night
Sheikh Rifai Surur, may God have mercy on him, is a witness to most stages of the modern Islamic movement, starting from the days of Nasser to his death nearly a year ago, so it is clear to you the importance of this book, which is considered the most important of his books
Excellent . The cleanliness is excellent and the service is very nice. Nothing is just far from the Haram
The first book I read for Dr. Mustafa Mahmoud ... frankly, I stand stunned in front of his logical analyzes ... he answers every mind that has been deceived by his accomplishments and baptized ... and involved himself in matters that rise to the ceiling ... his awareness ... silence all voices except the voice of instinct ... That is aware of and believes in the existence of God .... Glory be to Him.
One of the most beautiful things I have read in my life. From Granada to Fez, then to Tombouctu, through Africa and the country of Zinj, then to Fez again, and from there to Cairo, then to Constantinople, then to Cairo again, and from there to Fez, then Rome, the Vatican, Florence, and Naples ... then return to Fez at the end. Round trip around the world. A journey in history ... from the fall of Granada to the conflict between the Mamluks and the Ottomans in Egypt. From the heyday of Rome to its downfall at the hands of heretical Lutherans. The journey of a human life he called his family Hassan bin Muhammad Al-Wazzan and he was called by the father of the Vatican John Lyon Medici. A person known in Africa as Rumi and known in Rome as an African. His life was not perfect, as in most books, through which pictures of Amin Maalouf know life as it really is, life in reality and on earth, as God created it and as it has estimated for us. A life in which happiness coincides with sadness and calamities comes after, followed by relief and flight from God’s destiny to God’s destiny. And we realize in the end that God is arresting us with the right, extending it to us. .. Hassan or Leon concluded his life book with a compass to his son, it is one of the most beautiful things that were said, and if the father had not given his son any other, he would have stopped him. Wherever you are, people will want to explore your skin and your prayers, so be careful not to tickle their instincts, my son, and beware that you will not yield to the crowd as a Muslim, Jew or Christian, they should satisfy you as you are or lose you. And when the minds of people waving to you, tell yourself the land of God, wide and spacious, which is his hand and heart. Never hesitate to move beyond all seas, beyond all frontiers, homelands and beliefs.
One of the best things I read to Ibrahim Nasrallah ..
Night and not the sweetest. It seems the design of this hotel is designed for business people, but I enjoyed recreation, the service is excellent and the hotel is quiet and romantic. nothing
Her earlier narration grew up and I forgot that I had a beauty of Maybhr .. As for her novel, these maps of labyrinth have far exceeded that, it is closer to a tragic epic, mixed with you of suspense.
A novel that does not die even if its owner is absent from life
Exceptional. Close to the important centers. Disturb the end of the night, the sound of songs loudly
Excellent . Chloe, the Wi-Fi is completely free, and the cleanliness is perfect. The only thing negative about the hotel is the smallness of the room and the smallness of the bathroom only
Very good hotel and staff. Location, service, value, cleanliness, staff. Internet connection disconnected
Wow wow wow The last page is the summary of all the narration. Wow. A very beautiful story. Diligently. I loved it too. I loved it too. Its events are very difficult after some. I got a page behind some of what I don’t think I’ve extracted a page. I admit I was lost in the first place. But everything was clear. The novel is very, very terrible. Worthy of the stars. . Thanks to all the characters of the novel, the most important of them is Habiba and Hussam. Thanks to the author. You are really my two cells. I live with them as one of them. Imagine the shape of this factor
Rest and stay safe. The reception is great, the response is fast, the restaurant is five star.
Excellent. Calm and comfortable in the room. The absence of a bidet in the toilets,
Exceptional. The staff I met is very respectful and elegant.
The end of Moribeh. . Open: /
good. Location, hygiene, parking, convenience, handling. Internet paid
Thank God it was an excellent trip and the hotel in general is excellent. Very close to the sanctuary, the rooms are spacious. There is no laundry and ironing in the hotel, the system is self-catering, or you go to the shops outside .... lifts are slow
A beautiful feeling. Go back to the world of Harry Potter. I was very excited to read it. At first, I felt a spirit of Rolling in the novel, but then I was disappointed and entered a fantasy world other than the world of Harry Potter. For example, events are very fast, not used to. But the most important thing is excuse me in the expression that you have come with seventy ideas and a destination that has nothing to do with Rolling&#39;s world at all and mixing it in the mixer, so I became a mixture that came out of these ninety pages. It would have been better if you were not to put yourself in this predicament
Northeast. Express service, personal freedom for guests to eat quality. Double the normal taxi movement around the hotel, the high cost of the hotel taxi
Like Paul Sussman, get me back in every novel he has .. I live the life he created .. I love history and relics more than I love them.
Excellent . Its proximity to the campus and breakfast is great. The hotel is excellent and adequate
A unique booklet ... Ruling on top of spiritual horoscopes ... Of course, I will come back later to read an explanation of it, a sound, sane explanation of the Sufi shrines ... scared me that I found in the introduction to one of the explanations the explanation of the hadith if it was permissible to read something in the prayer other than the Qur’an The gift. Of course, this did not prevent me from reading the ruling in which there is no right ... Thank God for the grace of reason first and foremost.
good. I liked the hotel. No
Very good for families. Great reception for staff. nothing
Wonderful. The location was great, great view, but the price is expensive. The bathroom is beside the bed
Excellent . The proximity of the hotel to the house of God, forbidden cleanliness, comfort and calm Nothing, everyone is perfect
Excellent . . Expensive food and drinks, no bag carrier
The services must be complete because next time I will not reside with you. Calm and comfortable. I could not follow the football and was brought in with a very bad receiver. The TV is very old. The pool is very small and not so deep.
I would love to go back to him, but I hope he gets better. The place and the calm. Breakfast was not as good as before
Thank you to the employee for his good handling ... The location is excellent and quiet .. the size of the villa .. and comfort. Most services are not available like restaurants .. all under construction ..
As I read it, I felt that I was a part of it. I live in Granada with Hassan, Saad, Mariama and Salima. I walk on the banks of the Chanel river, I smell the smell of jasmine and the Damascene rose that was planted in its gardens. I walk in the dialogues and take a look at the cisterns. I move from Granada to Valencia to Cordoba. I have never read about Andalusia, but it caught my eye on the ancient history that we built on its land, the bitter reality our Arab ancestors lived in Andalusia, and the horrific ways the Spaniards took to drive the Arabs out of them and erase their identity ...
Stay and rest. Staff services were upscale.
We ask God to grant them success. We wish them the best of luck.
Comforts . Good treatment, staff, cleanliness and location. There is no
The idea of the book is wonderful .. The most amazing is the innocence and spontaneity of children&#39;s words in all the poems .. It makes you smile throughout the reading period and you enjoy and are surprised by some of the writings and sad about others ... I dream of something great for. P in paper s .. dream of a world of p. And three suns ... I wrote a thin film ... and no one was ill. How much? The world of my dreams p. We sit under the sun. With the gathering of vacationers, I looked in the blue and blue sky. A little B, B, after that. Chairs were stacked on the tables. it is okay. The white, white, was the strongest. Rainbow. I flew. Over the rainbow. It was warm. It has many colors. We skated. Towards the bottom completely. To the water. Then. I was not wet ... we flew over the rainbow. Here we go to mine. We stayed for a few years
good. Location. The rooms are small / the kitchen is a passage of cooking, and all the hotel rooms are connected. Mr. Haider, the receptionist, helped me a lot by handing me the shelf early, but unfortunately, it did not improve to receive me. May God reward him.
Exceptional. The hotel staff, without exception, is extremely helpful and understands all matters and requirements.
Political philosophy is a book in the depth of philosophy, history and civilization that dives between the solid dualism between the foundations of monotheism and polytheism and the loose dualism, even if it did not give it its full right, because it is a theoretical deconstructive book between faith and disbelief. It is a small book. The contemporary reader and Muslim generally feel the importance of the theoretical dismantling effort presented by Al-Masiri in the first part of partial and comprehensive secularism in particular. And pushes the Islamic to search and learn about the branch of ontology or existentialism because it is a philosophy that expresses a loophole in the entire Western civilization. And for anyone who wants to read the book, I advise him to read the first part of the comprehensive and partial secularism and John McCurry&#39;s Existentialism Book. Before reading it to be able to obtain the basic message presented by the author. God knows
The most wonderful book that teaches you how to deal with people, so shadow of the noble prophetic biography. Dr. Muhammad Al-Areefi&#39;s style is so interesting and interesting in this book that it attracts you to the point that you cannot leave it until you complete it.
very good. Excellent location and dealings by staff, good reception and clean room. Breakfast is very bad
I really heard very much and really, Anis Mansour gives up laughing from your heart
Worth the experience. The location is excellent, comfortable, the wing system is great, and the staff are excellent. The furniture needs to be changed, especially the carpet, the absence of cooking utensils and household utensils. The lighting is true, it is romantic and quiet, but sometimes we need stronger lighting.
Nice hotel but beginners staff need training. The hotel is beautiful, luxurious and close to the sanctuary. Entry procedures are delayed a lot more than an hour and the room was changed after staying in it and the room service is bad and they do not come despite contacting them more than once
In more than one place I have seen, he explains the Arab reality more precisely than the Arab himself can do .. that makes you face facts that you deny about yourself and the nature of your home .. really wonderful. But will it be the same Japanese view of the Arabs after the Arab Spring revolutions?
When I read Marquis&#39; novel, I hope it never ends..I love his style of narration, description, and simple narration. As for me to read him short stories, this is the real pleasure. I was amazed by every story .. I did not disappoint .. I knew that his short stories are totally different from any stories I have previously read to any writer. All stories are great, but I liked it the most, and I think I will not read like them. Blood on the ice ... its shock shocked me and I did not feel it when I read absolutely suddenly it ended and left the shock and then read it immediately after its completion in order to understand the events again .. I may have missed reading or understanding ... It ended again with the same shock. Telephone .. Distinctive and nerve-wracking and fun artwork. I think if it became a movie or a play it would have been an overwhelming success. Maria .. The idea alone is holding ... The idea of buying a grave .. It takes you to another world that makes you contemplate and think about this miserable, calm and peaceful soul at the same time. I highly recommend reading the collection to know another marquise
Evaluation . The level of cleanliness was very high in addition to the level of food and service, as well as the quality of the beds and the air-conditioning of the rooms is excellent .. Receiving the room was not done on time upon arrival and housing was in a small room I and the family are not a suite or on request at all and the delay was for two hours, which caused disturbing mood and uncomfortable when Arrival if I had some works in the afternoon, as well as a wedding in the evening.
It seems to me from reading the other comments that I am. I did not notice the dimensions of the plot. As others understood it, it seems to me that some did not pick up the primary goal that Mitchell tried to reach .... I will try to clarify this point and what I understand from the book, then I will talk about my impression of the book .. I will start with what I understood; the book basically talks about The philosophy of colonial rule, neither the history of colonial events nor its final outcome, and for this reason the author spoke in the introduction about the philosophies of Jacques Derrida and Michel Vaucault in. This philosophy is based on two principles: the first is a high degree of representation, that is, the use of signs on meanings that are not physically present, for example, the organization of the new European-style neighborhoods in Cairo and Rabat was a symbol of the existence of a precise system, different and separate from the buildings and streets It is the article of the organization itself, and the old neighborhoods have been preserved to symbolize the lack of order, in contrast with the new neighborhoods .. The second basis: It is the principle of permanent control, that everyone be under observation, without the observation authority being observed or visible. What I see and understand is that these two principles are part of modern systems of government in general, so the introduction of new army systems and forced recruitment The one who started with Muhammad Ali was not a conspiracy but a transfer of the prevailing systems in Europe, as well as education systems and the architecture of cities and villages, and the brutality with which this matter was made was part of this, perhaps forced labor during the era of Muhammad Ali and Ibrahim his son Ziada and Diligence from them .. This is not a justification for these methods in any way, but an attempt to understand the reason behind it, and Muhammad Ali and the workers of Tawfik and the British attempt to transform Egypt to serve its economy were motivated by this approach, so their solution was to transfer the European systems of government with its philosophy .. Follow this of course Attempts to change culture, religion, language, and literature, bad faith cannot be excluded from it, and those who rise up to address this These are attempts, including Mustafa Kamel, who attacked Qasim Amin in the matter of women&#39;s emancipation, despite his conviction of some of the principles of this system, as it appeared in his talk about methods of education .. Attempting to implement this philosophy of government in our country led to the emergence of this collision, so the writer applied the theories of Derrida To clarify the weakness of this philosophy .. This is what I understood from the writer&#39;s intent, and the damage that occurred to Egypt was not only due to the application of this system, except for the impact of the same on Western countries. The system of oppression that we suffer now is partly the result of this philosophy, but the main reason is the fact that the military and the rest of the state in general agree on corruption and injustice, as if it is a religion that has ... As for my impression of the book, it is difficult to define it. The book raised more questions in my mind than answers, and it is a commendable point in it, especially since these questions converged with other questions that I was thinking about the nature of these regulations. Two shortcomings I took on this edition and the book: Despite the quality of the translation to some extent, I found some spelling errors and punctuation, especially in the recent chapters .. Some parts of the book could have been presented in an easier language.
Exceptional. Nice view of the sea and elegant treatment from the existing staff. I would recommend this hotel .. God bless you.
Romantic type of special kind of love. The book, in its simplicity and lack of events, is one of the most beautiful needs of its village. Maybe because I am twice as old as old men:. But seriously, what you can read is beautiful
good. The hotel is very good .... its only problem is there are no groceries or restaurants nearby
Despite the many criticisms and attacks on the narrator, I decided to read it ... I did not regret how many of the readers felt ... and I did not complain about any of the details as some complained. The novel is realistic in every sense that carries the meaning of .. discusses issues of great importance .. by discussing between people, how do they start and how they ended..with the end is not expected..and if I felt that it is the natural end .. I do not have happy ends in life often. All the characters were carefully crafted carefully, carefully and accurately .... although you may be mistaken in their names in the first ... .. the reason can be this narrative style that transports you from one important task to another ... you are interested in the other in less than seconds and you forget your eagerness to know about an event In the first ... the way to present events is new, but enjoyable ... by living in a world and then moving you to another smoothly and then to another and so on. Photography is more than amazing. The novel has no orientation of any kind that imposes it on the reader, but the novel is only a neutral reflection of reality, personalities and real situations.
Wonderful novel. She endures an extraordinary amount of emotion, moves smoothly and connects her brilliantly. I liked all the protagonists for their weakness, strength, flaws and advantages. Even the people I met on the coffee liked me..They are the magic mix for the Egyptian people. The hero&#39;s confidence in his love for Sarah, his homeland and his owner is his strength. His recognition of his weakness and feelings of humanity and his zeal for those who lost him from his hands. The hero’s attempt to prove to his country that he loves him despite the wound and despite the cruelty, we are all this man, my friend. Linking the tragedy of the Arab world to the tragedy of Egypt with the tragedy of all heroes is a genius idea seriously. My greetings
Comfort and beauty. Everything is beautiful in the hotel. nothing
Excellent. Reception. Cleanliness
Believe who said ... To understand the Qur’an, you should read the Prophet’s biography. It is the biography of the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, which is the greatest biography that human history has known in its feet, present, and future..How not and his biography is documented in the book of God Almighty, it is preserved in the Holy Quran .... This illiterate prophet Muhammad Ibn Abdullah, peace and blessings of God be upon him, was truly a human being.
Excellent. . When requesting room cleanliness, it was not done in a manner suitable for the star hotels
Excellent hotel and staff I had a great time while staying at this hotel. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. I would like to stay here again. The hotel was very clean and the breakfast was excellent. Thank you again for the great experience.
very good. The location of the hotel is excellent and the room cleanliness. Front desk staff slowed when receiving rooms, parking is insufficient
It is unfortunate that the enemies of Islam know its ability and the Muslims do not know it. They knew from the beginning of the call that Islam is an invasive religion of its nature that is rejected only by those with souls, it is a religion consistent with the pure common sense that broke the right and did not contaminate the disease of arrogance .. it is a religion that addresses the human mind and appreciates and respects it. And he seeks the supremacy of the human spirit, which always seeks to find something metaphysical related to it in order to fill the void within it, as he does not distance himself from the fools of Jews and Christians who own nothing of their religion except to convince his adherents that they only have to believe in crucifixion and salvation, otherwise there is no there Something about peace, s Blood for man is a complete system of religion and world, and it always pushes man to ask and research not only to believe in what is said without realizing his mind .. Hence, conspiracies have been woven for him from the first moment in which he commanded his prophet to crack what he commanded and warn his close clan, since the war was fierce ever since. Now and for more than a year, we have witnessed that the war is not over since the invasion of Badr, and through the wars of apostasy, and what the old and modern Crusades are about us far away ... but from what the foreheads claim is that the war began to take another more serious curve, rather than if we were in the past fighting people who did not belong to me Our religion, and not to our race, are today fighting those who are sons Our skin speaks in our tongues and they condemn our religion, but they are a dagger in the back of Islam. There is no doubt that those who sold themselves to the Crusader and Judaic ambitions brought about I do not say in Islam, but in the Muslims of defeats what the enemies of Islam failed to do for centuries, so we had to face these and our war with them before our battle began With others, the class must first be cleansed before the battle begins ... and the question that is always repeated remains for this hatred of another ???. The answer is no, as these people realize that it is a battle, and the end result is that only one must win. When do we realize that ?????
The most beautiful words
good. The rooms are tidy, the sofa is comfortable for children and the standard of hygiene is high. Room space is very narrow and parking for a car in the cellar is narrow and not suitable for large family cars and external parking is not shaded and the reservation location gave me the hotel the option of accommodation for adults and children but unfortunately the room only suits two children with adults and that is the smallest room size
The hotel is contracted out. Organized, rested, and calm .. nothing.
The first time I read a supplication, and at first, I was not encouraged to read because of boredom and disgust at times from romantic novels that transform love into desire and the woman into a body .. In the beginning I found the novel normal and I thought that it might take days to read .. After several pages it turned into my addiction, so I ended it A few hours and for the first time .. I did not feel that the woman was only a body and love did not turn into desires only and a very interesting prayer style. You cannot expect events to live with heroes in every word and sympathize with everyone. Doaa also maintained the teachings of her religion and this was a wonderful thing we rarely find and proved that in Islam there are creators without regret and the offensive and insulting and insignificant writings without lusts ... The bumpers. For the first time, I love a novel to this degree for me that deserves ten stars .. And I hope that the era of creative people such as supplication and its likes will be close and we will finish the era of beautiful phrases without meaning
Awesome, worth the highest ratings. Easy to find near the station. You can walk away after the post office and behind the giant Subway Sandwich Restaurant. The place is clean and there is a process of renewal in full swing. The hotel was hi and the staff was friendly and the room is modern and very clean. Free Wi-Fi throughout Ask the reception desk for a password. Clean and modern breakfast room with an excellent selection of foods. Our room was a little ahead of us which caused a little noise due to traffic but it is negligible compared to other places we have stayed and we will definitely keep this hotel in mind when we return again to Dusseldorf.
After reading a novel, I knew how to master the writing of the novel by mixing the literary and political styles together at the hands of the English writer George Orwell .. a novel that diverges in the depth of advanced societies, rooted in it and in its dictatorial system with an exciting constitutional constitutional template, was able to predict the future future of peoples, the matter What distinguished her among the world’s political novels .. And if Orwell’s writing was not an interesting fun, I would not have fled to his other narrative, which is rich in definition, Animal Farm, because I am not one of those who really love political topics. It is a masterpiece in its own right that does not look like Other .. Animal Farm. In the content:. Those who read Orwell&#39;s biography and his clear political positions understand exactly as he submits himself that this novel has its satirical purpose, mocking communism and the Stalinist regime that ruined the concept of socialism, in Orwell&#39;s opinion. Orwell, who fought Stalin in the atmosphere of World War II, came to describe this situation with a story, let me say, everyone can read and fully absorb it .. A farm that varies in its animals from pigs, dogs, horses, ducks, chickens, etc...the owner of the human is Jones She succeeds in draining it away from the farm, to take control of her own leadership. Between the pig Snowball and the other Napoleon, there are disagreements over the leadership of the farm and its affairs, so the turning point in the story takes place, where Napoleon can defeat Snowball in a violent fight when he feels the latter is victorious over him. This battle was the beginning of Napoleon&#39;s presidency of the farm, which Orwell symbolized Stalin as many critics analyzed .. The farm affairs develop, seven commandments are laid down as laws for them, some battles occur with other farms, all of this until we reach the paper end only, where it explains In short, the revolutionary who once revolted in the name of justice turned into a monster that does not differ from the human race by anything, as there is no difference between what is seen between a pig and a human being ... the end of what we are still under its weight ... It is true that it is by its events and personalities, where the explanation goes on, symbolizes what was before During and after the Stalinist era, as Orwell raged, it was only suitable for any society to be described as a human being. A distinct from Hiwanath ... only feet-two method:. When you read this novel, you come back like a child who loves token stories. Symbolism is a key element of this novel, which, if it lacks some narrative elements, is but it revolves around a certain historical era that was intelligently shaped by Orwell, on a farm of animals. It goes beyond being a short story, with its mark and sarcasm, to a hybrid world, in which the donkey obeys and does not speak to any defeated person, the loyal horse who works hard without knowing what is happening, the protected dog that represents the police of power, and the pig itself i.e. the power made by the people She pounced on him in the name of freedom ... a favorite.
Ahmed from Kuwait. Reception staff, hotel location, room cleanliness and sea views. The coffee shop and restaurant are on the last floor
The rule of law or the power of the sword ... is the law, O Sultan
I love the details that Essam Youssef talks to ... In the novel, I felt that an old person in the interior is what he wrote and in a quarter of a gram, I felt that an authentic tax is what he wrote..a honorable character, his family, his times, and his kinship written in handwriting, but the character of Walid His family and friends feel up to her from a reading book by Rabaa Elementary .. When we see Essam Hayrouh&#39;s uncle, where is the next novel?
There is nothing wrong . Excellent cleanliness and air conditioning. God willing, the appliances are excellent. The parking lots are very narrow and very few for the number of hotel guests.
Myself become like a heck: a genius person
The experiment must be repeated. Wonderful place and good hospitality, the multiplicity of activities, events and restaurants. In the evening the entrance to the hotel is not suitable for families
Very good and suitable. . The hotel is still using the old system to maintain the value of insurance for the room or ID card and this procedure is not applicable in many other hotels
Brown stories. A super cool book. Sincerely, I enjoy reading it very much. A mixture of sincere feelings and feelings. Sadness, joy, love and rebellion .. I hope this is the first part. And wait for more. Brown stories. For my creative girlfriend. Sarah Darwish. :
My stay was generally happy. The room is spacious compared to other hotels, the room decorations are beautiful, the bathroom is good, and the guest service is excellent and upscale. There is almost everything beside the hotel although it is a bit random shops. There is a new annoying phone located in the middle of each floor and next to the rooms and its sound is very loud ... wake me up from sleep more than once .... I would never recommend this hotel to anyone who may sleep in the afternoon or noon times because of this annoying phone. There is a pub for drinking alcohol next to Reception and elevators The elevator took a drunken man with me and one of the hotel employees was forced to go up with us in order to protect me from what I would have been exposed to with this drunken man. Sometimes the smell of alcohol is evident in the reception area. The guests inside their rooms are surprisingly the siphon inside the bathrooms and an excuse for the expression of a backward siphon ... and not me Very Shattaf
Great experience with this book and an invitation to think
good. The hotel is beautiful and has an Arabic feel in the hotel decorations, and I liked the dealings of the hotel manager and his sophisticated dealings, Brother Muhammad. I also thank all the employees and hotel workers for their fine dealings, and this is what I liked a lot in the hotel ... I did not like the hotel&#39;s morning buffet, as its level was very low compared to the hotel. I wish to diversify the meals provided in the buffet. I also did not like the pool as it is very narrow
The book is written by a Shiite scholar, in which he talks about the deviation that occurred in the Shiite approach. The author cited many references of the Shiites to explain the locations of the deviation for this reason. To the right. The author: Corruption of a person comes in two ways: sex and money, both of which are available to the masters. Farooj and Adbar through pleasure and others. And money through the five and what is thrown in the thresholds and scenes, who among them stands up to these temptations, especially if we know that most of them took this path except for the satisfaction of his desires in sex and money ??
Amenridis
Exceptional. It does not need some development. Eating quality
An anecdotal collection worth reading and worth converting into a series. As usual, Amr El Gendy fascinated us with psychology
Exceptional. Very great experience, everything is beautiful.
Beautiful, it ended in record time, like all of Noor&#39;s novels. But this time, as far as I am concerned, the novel ended with the death of dreams. Or do you think that what is meant is that dreams sometimes die but can be replaced by another method? Even if this was intended, then everything I read after her death did not concern me at all, and I did not mean to reduce the effort of the author at all, so there must have been an end to the novel, and I have succeeded completely in writing this end, which some may see a happy ending. Yes, it is a happy ending to Jabr and Mary, after all their suffering. Until I wrote that suddenly appeared on the scene, I took a share of that happiness, even if it was not complete. As for Yassin, the rich handsome doctor who loved sincerely and sincerely, he made me cry with his message of dreams that I read in public in appreciation of her or in appreciation of what was between them. Sorry, I did not dream of dreams, I pity her a lot until the moment of her death when I told Gabr that it was from her scent .. She did not tell him my daughter or daughter or even Yassin&#39;s daughter. Just an orphaned girl who smells who I love. Algebra is one of the characters that we only see between the two sides of a book, so where is the man who marries someone whom she does not love, who bears her wailing and depression and raises her daughter who is from another man. Where is the man who loves in this way? . Also, we will not see it in our real world. We will not see this woman who would like her daughter to be called her husband&#39;s sweetheart. And smile. I was born from a mother and father that you did not see. Mama and Papa spoke to two other people who were not her real parents. So is there more cruelty than that?
good. I liked the site, as well as good handling. The price is high for the services
A very good book considers that the historical events of the Torah are real, but the land of the Torah is different .. The writer provides evidence of the names of many villages mentioned in the Torah but it is not present in Palestine but rather west of the Arabian Peninsula in the region extending from the south of Taif to the Yemeni borders .. The book It has not been widely published, but it is worth reading. All you need is to read the book on the computer with the operation of Google Earth and direct it to the region, and you will be really surprised.
I studied pharaonic history, and read a lot about it, but I never enjoyed it as I enjoyed the narration of the Tayyibis, the novel has important political projections, and its language is beyond description.
Very nice book. I enjoyed it very much
A distinguished book ... Regardless of the confusion that results from the severe intellectual engagement against what is presented by Louis Awad throughout the book, the distinguished book topic makes you condone this problem
Very beautiful, as I got used to Abahem Nasrallah. In this version, rape of the country is embodied in the form of rape
I liked his sincerity, frankness, his criticism, his love for some of his professors in Al-Azhar, the accuracy of his description of his feelings, and the persistent difficulties and his determination to reach what he aspires to
Experience and adventure are the way to expel delusions, no future without a past, no life without death, sometimes I appreciate ignorance of what is and the facts and I see it as the greatest blessing in life, let down bitter, loneliness is fatal, and affiliation is the truth that we seek and is with us. I don’t know, I like Jose so much, how? He seemed to me transparent and pure like a lost child, and he is. Merla .. I touched a part of my heart, represented me as if I were in another life .. and the rest of the characters were not important to me ... Mendoza, yes, that man who needed love more than anything else .. the idea of belonging and the idea of God .. What does God want from me? And why did I create this character and these circumstances in this land? . The journey of searching for belonging, we all need such a journey in our lives ... I hope to arrive safely to my country that God has chosen for me ..
Painful is this diary as it was written in it not new .. But the language in which it was written gave him a new dimension .. I depicted the pain for you, so what came back between you and him with a veil became their pain and hope. The story mainly revolves around the writer .. Alawite supported the revolution and her family abandoned it and their enemies were traitorous .. And .. they asked her blood and on the other side who sees it as a traitor to the revolution, it occurred between the intersection of fire. However, this story was not only what the pages of the book contained .. Rather, the books were full of testimonies and stories depicting the suffering of the Syrians in the first four months of the revolution ... The most painful to me were stories about children I understand that adults suffer, and that year of life .. There is suffering Everywhere and time ... and if they vary in intensity .. but .. the young
A book that affected me so much .. I cannot really describe my feelings at this moment ... Once I finish it, most of what I can say is that the wheel of time is rotating and the state of Palestine is now due to two reasons linking the coolness of the Palestinians and the Arab leanness ...
Nice and fun book. I do not advise anyone who is afraid of the jinn to read it. I benefited from you with information about this strange world
I got the relaxation and entertainment I needed. Service and cleanliness of the place.
The writing style is a little strange, but the book is great, since it talks about what I did not find elsewhere, I liked the book and was amazed at the method:
Exceptional. The location is convenient and close to transportation, there are restaurants, pharmacy and supermarket under the hotel and the staff is helpful.
Distinguished hotel with great views of the Dubai Mall fountain and Burj Khalifa lake. The breakfast is delicious and varied and the bed is very comfortable.
On hunger in its broadest sense, about yearning and hunger for knowledge, trekking and memories, in short the book is a biography with a different vision
Exceptional. Everything is quiet, cleanliness. Nothing except the site, which does not own a private car
Creativity is deviating from the ordinary, the usual and the traditional, and this novel is creativity in the full sense, it deviated from the prevailing and proposed unless other accounts dared to raise it and exposed what was hidden in the folds of Kuwaiti society regarding this issue, the issue of searching for identity, an issue governed by customs And traditions, features of faces, fear of scandal, as opposed to giving up morals and humanity. Bamboo gave a rich and very beautiful novel, whether on the level of the story or style of writing. Great job, crushes the prize
The book consists of thoughts and short stories full of black comedy, a different and beautiful book.
A long time ago, I did not read novels ... and I longed for a novel that delighted me with the splendor of its style, the charm of its speech, the excitement of its events, its ambiguity, and your expectations that you will not find anything with it and waiting for things that will not come and watch you until the end. I was longing for a novel that would not leave me until I finished it nor do I think it would leave me after it was finished. That was Kigar, starting from the mysterious name that is revealed with events and envelopes, which may imply impotence and depression, but carry with him the hope that emanates from the sun, which comes with its flaming rays illuminating the events ... and the extended hand looking for what? On deliverance ... or hope ... or happiness ... or belonging. All this comes accompanied by talking about the lost Siwa of Paradise, I talked more about it in the longing for this captivating oasis in which you feel the purity and innocence of life, I longed to visit it and listen to more stories of its good people about its history, its elegance and its charm
I see that one of the most important reasons that prepared the writer to respond to his atheist friend was his knowledge and study of heavenly and non-heavenly religions as well as his passing of similar experience, which helped him understand what is going on with his friend’s personality as well as his knowledge of philosophy and his wonderful scientific culture, which allowed him to respond to his atheist friend. God have mercy on Dr. Mostafa Mahmoud
She is Mrs. Agatha, who has brilliant police ideas and tight plot. Her novel is great and boredom will not touch its reader throughout the reading period
Change my view of many things of life
Virtue .. Paul and Virgini ... Bernardine de Saint-Pierre ... France ... translation: Mustafa Lotfy Al-Manfalouti ... When you read for Manfalouti .. you are reading an authentic Arabic novel .. You forget with Manfalouti’s translation that the author of the novel is French .. An interesting novel that added translation and Arabization of Al-Manfalouti to the novel beauty and sweetness ... Romeo and Juliet .. Qais and Laila .. separated by life and joined together by death .. It is a message of preacher in the folds of a novel .. I left it only with the last letter in it .. It is the poem written by the Manfalouti summarizes the novel .. Love in its highest meanings .. and happiness in the simplicity of living .. And the virtue of loving the poor and helping the aggrieved, chastity and honor ... Virtue ... his sentiment sheet ... as an evaluation of this book .... And long as you keep the Merciful ..
Exceptional. Beautiful, tidy, comfortable and great price.
A novel that shed the spotlight on many phenomena, and of course it looked because I love Ibrahim Essa and a reading that I liked.
I recommend it. Excellent and comfortable. They didn&#39;t wash spoons or knives, only the dishes they cleaned
An exciting novel, as usual, Ala Al-Aswany .. I did not miss a moment while I was reading it. It is not a pure historical novel ... even though this was my belief when I heard about the historical period about which you are talking. Honestly ... I do not think it takes him five years, according to what is written behind .. Although the people you are talking about are theoretically impossible to answer any documented information they were living with what and not the details of their lives with the magnificence that Dr. / Alaa wrote. The narrative plot was weaker than the previous two novels, the architecture of Jacobian and Chicago ... I had imagined that all people would relate to more than that on the last novel, as he did with an unparalleled genius in Chicago. I could have said that the dose of sex was in excess of the need ... but no ... sincere ... for me this is a normal thing ... without hypocrisy and frankly sex and especially stayed in Egypt is actually events and represents a part and a terrible factor in The lives of the Egyptians. However, he stated in the novel that he provided the dose of enjoying the novel and its events and let the one read it, and he is amused especially that many of it are related to the cam of Qafsheya and a special story when I come to Aisha&#39;s biography ... However, Alaa Al-Aswany thought he was intentional and basically he was speaking On him again, we will also speak on it, as well as a line .. This was generally more polite and less shocking than the previous two novels ... especially, and we know that this period was a period in which this talk will happen .. this is not a period far away from us in Time, which gives it a separation from us in a way ... as if we are watching the things that happen, not part of the written reality. The genius of the novel in two needs:. The first thing is to choose the main topic and heroes. This novel talks about the invisible people ... as one of us when he was watching the images of Faruq and not the era in general, he focused on the image of the Aswan man and not the Nubian who stands to serve the people de ... we are all attributed and commented on the distinction of Faruq. .. The beauty of the princesses ... the confusion ... the personalities and relationships ... the sessions ... the decoration even and the inanimate objects were more important to us than we do not see them as countries ... even though the countries of our ancestors and our relatives ... the countries of the true Egyptians .. Countries of most of the Egyptian people ... countries of scavengers and delivery workers who are sitting on the coffees day and night and those who are confident in the lines of living and the good children who are in the college I did not marginalize the owners and put them on, it is not like that ....... The people who do not appear under the sun ... The people who live in the faces of the walls ... The people who feel them are not in society ... The Murlock who spoke to Wales in a wonderful machine Time. These people are the mainstay of any society ... The people who do not struggle to fear and know them will find another world ... All are vital, honesty, worries and feelings .. A real world where real people live, not fake with little money, parties, shows, and Arab and Brides have a game and a little zombie, they move and act like a place ... the world that Metsi knew of his interference and was amazed by it and decided that she sacrifices everything needed so that it remains one of him despite the external form that asphalt. He concluded, but the novel and a very hard copy of the image that was righteous ... which I think you did not focus on in the first place when I came to buy the novel .. Or it can be felt that it is a picture of a closed or not this way .... countries of the protagonists .. countries that strike each day In the end, if you mistake it or not, it is wrong, for justice, and I hope that they will not be like the mind of the people ... The countries that exist are not living. Those living are not living ... insects who respond from all of Egypt to suck their blood, and when they die, they are in a million others. ... the people who didn’t hope ... The six envisioned countries are Abdoun, Hassanein, Karara, Bahr, Abdel Aziz, Mahmoud, Samahi and others ... who we did not like We see them other than when Dr. Alaa and Rana people are really in this novel. The second point: This is a strange perspective about the novel, and I will read it to me. Man is by nature a primitive being ... instinctively ... originally like any animal ... Originally instincts are the primary motive in animals ... and this is not an insult ... this is a fact ... instincts are a grain of hormones that are excreted in us, as they do not excrete at any An animal ... lust, fear, hunger, and thirst ... It is true that the difference is that I have a mind of mind: whoever restrains the animal being led and our case is intended instincts and costly and free because this is the length of history in a cultural and moral class that is ours We will avoid this with our instincts, because we do not discuss animals ... a class that remains to be formed with our experiences ... with the collective mentality of human beings over time ... from religions and literature and He sees it ... it is the class that we work with people ... I can&#39;t tell a mask that in fact it is not a mask ... this is supposed to be left with us being a human being and a human being ... it is the layer that we say we are supposed to do what we do and what we do in situations .. is what determines our behavior based on our social position, etc. But no matter how thick the layer is, this is the atmosphere for each one of us ... except that our subconscious mind is not a penny, it is the origin in us, it is a grain of chemicals, our life, we will not be able to get rid of it, no matter how much we try, and no matter how sophisticated ... ... whether with all rudeness, like what they are doing. They used to work with Mahmoud and Fawzi in the novel, and like what I did not work, he did not work with the girls who slept with them ... whether by finding justifications like what he worked with. Tipping back. Whether in circumstances that pass by our superiority ... like what was full and Abdoun hours they spent with the Koo and Mister Wright in every call, although this was not what anyone imagined. I was asked by real feelings of contradicting custom, which people settled on, like the opinions of the Egyptians, and the love of Metsi for the whole .... and this was what I was talking about, that the sex in the novel was employed from this perspective ... I know you are just any good community .. You will find the richest and most aristocratic classes by interfering and interacting with the lowest class in society with the image of your age what you imagined .. and what more picture will shock you other than sex, Alaa can explain it in the story .... instincts are a main engine in people&#39;s behavior ... interactions and results The one who appears on her with the strangest aspiration of the results of changing the course of any nation .. Think of burning my dear to himself and not what, except for Hitler, remains Hitler .. Q I was talking about Er. In the end ... the Automobile Club is not better than the Yaqoubian Building and not Chicago ... My relationship with it is not so much because it happened in a relatively long period ... The political projection if it means means to the one with a tiger there is not clear to me ... People are not drawn like I did not get used to Alaa Al-Aswany ... but in general I enjoyed her very much. And oh right ... the first thing in the first place is that the characters of the novel are out of it ... and Karl Benz&#39;s time is not surprising. I can say that Karl Benz’s time appears to be an important part of the novel, which is that the six are always a key driver in any event .. either by her will or whether by attracting the man to her, she has the same idea of instincts as Brdo, and that this changes the course of any need ... but if it really meant it ... the novel remains a major aspect of its focus on one subject ... the point where writings are written and a complete literary aspect is adopted on it and a flaw originally comes as a sub-topic in a novel. The first part is for science fiction. I forgot to talk about it originally from the many pieces of what is strange and separate from the novel .. I do not know he was trying out a new need or what
Certainly charming if you want a very special holiday, book here quickly before you retire from the hard-working Christa in order to get the rest you really deserve. It will warmly welcome you, give you complete personal care, fulfill all your requests and provide you with any information you want about this extraordinary island. Accomodation in the magnificent, distinctive caves is first class: comfortable beds, well-equipped kitchen and shower room. Everything has great touches, and the cleanliness is a skilled maid who comes every day to change the covers and clean carefully. The best time is when sitting on the balcony amid beautifully cared for flowers, looking at the amazing volcanic landmark and watching the cliffs change to pink as the sun sets. In fact it is so special that you may leave the beach early to return to the charm of your balcony. There are hundreds of steps down stairs and then going up again, and breakfast is not served with such a good kitchen, who would need it? There is no swimming pool with the Aegean Sea that surrounds you, who needs it too. If any of these matters cause you, you will not be able to enjoy the magic of Ares Caves. But you will be the loser. Additional tip: You will be encouraged to take a trip to the local volcano. The boat trip around the volcanic landmark is wonderful, but the volcano itself is a disappointment. You have to take a steep path for half an hour in the heat, and then search for some brown stones. There is no swimming pool with steam bubbles, not even any trace of smoke. You have to wait for Iceland or New Zealand to arrive
Quiet location. Cleanliness and location. The time of the exit told us that there is no worker carrying bags from the room except after a few minutes because the time is the time to leave .. He was surprised by a hotel of this size unable to increase work during this hour since they already know that there is pressure which we had to carry our bags as women ourselves
Very comfortable and experience I wish to repeat. Almost everything..free childcare is really cool. The view of the Haram is very limited .. It must be mentioned when booking the cost of parking is very high, riyals / day, I hope to reduce it
good . . Turnip openness
I heard if I called alive, but there is no life for those who call ..
Comfort and beauty at the Hilton Walk. . Need alone, not long waiting for the pans
Beautiful views of the Nile We stayed here in our second week in June after we sailed the first week in the Nile, so we wanted a place not far from the resort so we do not have to wander away and this hotel was independent in itself so it was perfect because it contains three or four restaurants in the place To choose from among them, and the facilities are expected to be three-star. The hotel enjoys a great location directly overlooking the Nile, where many falconry trips sail from the other side, and we can also see hot air balloons springing on the horizon; these two scenes are beautiful scenery alike. We were lucky enough to be moved to rooms overlooking the Nile that were a bonus ... although I never imagined that the rooms overlooking the pool would be so beautiful. Everything in the hotel was clean and comfortable, but I am obliged to provide a negative comment about the staff of the guards in the main restaurant ... Many of them were rude and rude and did not serve you well unless I gave them a good tip on a daily basis, but in general it is a good hotel.
From books that leave your soul. I love CVs, because I live in them. I was ashamed of myself while I was in front of a book for a great woman like Mrs. Mary. She left her soul for knowledge .. until her husband supported her with all he could. For her sincerity, she gave us a living and uplifting model of a woman who fought under the control of men. Reading is more fruitful than just a review
Exceptional. . The hotel has no insulation
The real writer is the one who attracts you to the world of his letters from the first pages of his book until you reach the end that you did not want to reach her so quickly .. Mashary Al-Abeed .. Thank you for the story: Ghayeb. Because you absent me from the world around me ... righteous
Excellent. The reception crew is the highest in respect and humility.
Wonderful. . Brands
comfortable . Good handling of workers. The lack of the Arabic language in workers
Very cool and fun.
The city of Jammamilla is as life in the future. The bed was comfortable and breakfast was not free with the room. Somewhat expensive, coffee and hotel services are not available yet
good. To kindness. The place has buildings that are built during the day that can be annoying due to construction
A book is a collection of articles for Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq, the man who brings ideas from the airy Shamkh ... The thread linking all these very cute articles..is a critique of the qualities of most of us and the stranger that we see only in those around us ... The great one says ... whoever has a home from Azaz .... He also reminds me of the wisdom that says why do you not blame in people O wise man, he said I was busy with my faults about the faults of people ... The writer criticizes himself and those around him with utmost candor and circumstance .... You will not be able to curb a laugh that escapes you in some places of the book ... I laughed very much as I envisioned the dog of the writer&#39;s children ... The Siberian origin who cuts the newspapers to Fatafeat before he touched Land:. Neither his friend Hassan, who could not write his name without spelling errors هه هه لاحظ لاحظ لاحظ Notice that the name is a metaphor for the author about his friend&#39;s extreme ignorance, and the worst is that he wanted to participate in university elections as a representative of the cultural committee
He is the last dreamer in a world that preys on dreams. He did not change reality, but its effect will not be erased from souls. The world does not need advice, but to set an example. All fools do not stop talking. . We will not have what we live for .. if we have nothing to die for. . Guevara is dead men
A beautiful place with all the best greetings. My family and I spent days at the Sofitel, it was a wonderful and beautiful stay, the hotel staff are friendly, the pools are wonderful, the beach is more than wonderful, the sand is clean and soft, red and pink in color and the small colorful fish accompany you in swimming and diving. The services and facilities are great, the building is beautiful and ancient, the rooms are spacious, clean and have a beautiful view, the children&#39;s programs and the children&#39;s playground as well. The staff of the hotel is more than amazing .... What made my review deficient is the kitchen .... It would be nice if there was an Egyptian identity for the restaurant clearly defined, focusing on seafood and salads. An experience that I want to repeat soon, and if there was a big hot or warm pool I would have visited this place all year round. Sauna or hot jacuzzi is not enough, if you work on heating the water in the outdoor pools, the sun often does not go away and heating the water is neither difficult nor expensive. I advise everyone to visit Sofitel Taba and relax in it because it is a suitable place for adults and children alike. Greetings to all workers at the Sofitel Taba, in particular Ibrahim Effat. Dr. Ali Tawalbeh
Excellent, excellent, and a good transfer in the field of restaurants in Amman. Frankly, the pizza was very excellent, especially the flavor of natural wood and the presence of a specialized Italian chef. Frankly, the restaurant in general is excellent, but lacks diversity in pasta and the addition of other Italian food.
good. The location of the hotel is close to shopping and services. Lack of adequate parking for the hotel
A wonderful classic novel that tells the last days of Christ&#39;s life in a profound philosophical way in which the writer analyzes many social ideas, dialectical theses, and
Overall comfortable stay. Calm and services. The amount is exaggerated compared to the site
Suitable for families and conservative families. Insulators are weak and allow inconvenience from the outside, mentioning that there is a free juice drink that I did not get. Toiletries are incomplete
Sinan Anton rewrites the Iraqi pain in a different way, and covers many of the political opinions believed in the characters of this work, and guides the reader in a sophisticated manner towards the ugliness of the killing. Youssef. One of the few voices that I liked about the novel, despite the aesthetic of the narrative construction in this work, but I did not contact the people. I was satisfied with communicating with Youssef because he was rich with beautiful words ... a narration that tells of the murderous sectarianism that tore Iraq, the voice of Iraqi sorrow became clear in the works of Iraqi novelists They believed in difference and believed in intellectual controversy at some time. Death is present, killing has become a feature of difference, intellectual differences no longer exist in their gorgeous form, but rather killing and death in the human arena ... I content myself with this amount and leave the rest to the deficient reader who is able to understand the symbols that Sinan spread here and there, the hidden words and hidden messages that he sent to future generations ... =. Were some people very superficial, or only I who felt this way? I could not touch them, despite the size of their aches.
If we take into account that it is the beginnings of Ibrahim Issa’s novels and also the standard time in which he wrote the novel, which is a day, this story preceded the reality a lot, even if the end did not like me, as there are some unexplained events that I can almost say, I am illogical but it is a readable novel to understand Slightly
The hotel is comfortable and its price is ok. The room is equipped with items the guest needs. Unavailability of parking until the cars were withdrawn in front of the hotel without warning that the parking is subject to withdrawal, as there is no washing machine
The hotel is good, clean and the service is excellent. Breakfast is excellent and the bed is very good.
Comfortable hotel. Strategic location for families and easy to find place.
Good job Fast service, good reception, good cooperation with us, all plate accessories you have, special information and guidance for the campus available, and your good location is the reason for its convenience. We thank you and appreciate your cooperation to us, as long as Hassan Hassanein.
Sharzimah Al-Rawaa Hotel in terms of services, comfort and cleanliness, I advise you in which you spent a very enjoyable time. Cleanliness, good services, together with guests and Wi-Fi.
Wonderful. Excellent resort, location and services, overlooking the sea. Free internet access is not available and the resort does not deserve stars
good. Service, location, bed and lighting. Sometimes exaggerates the prices
I am now reminded of the words of Sheikh Shaarawi, may God have mercy on him:. The Sufi was the one who purified God, so God forgave him and he became a mystic; he remained dear and loved. Suhrawardi. The son of a rodent. Ibn Al-Arabi. Ezz bin Abdul Salam. In one version ... O lovers of beauty, communicate and communicate, and if the hypocrisy is rude, let honesty be valiant. It is true beauty ... Beauty fills the soul with divine love ... and gives the heart a bit of calm and tranquility ... No wonder about that, as this is the natural effect of God&#39;s love on any soul ..
A very wonderful and painful book at the same time, a lot of things in it touched me personally, most of the issues mentioned suffer from many women and are still ... pain a lot last chapter related to living models of women who suffer from conflict and difficult conditions for her heart to break and her back broken .. This is the first book I read to the Doctor despite my great admiration for her.
Exceptional. everything. Sometimes delayed cleaning
Excellent . I very much liked the sophistication and treatment of the reception staff all of them especially brother Nasser and his colleagues in the call center quickly in response to a bunch of speeches searching for the comfort of the guests wooing them, to achieve the right very wonderful very thank the administration for choosing such employees, in addition to the workers who are all wonderful, the furniture was very beautiful . The lack of a business center consisting of a free computer for guests to do some of their own work in addition to the morning breakfast the hotel level was not very tasty but it was not diversified in the required form it lacks some very simple things and my evaluation is from, the hotel parking was supposed to be an organization
The last part of the triple and the least glow
very comfortable.. . Everything is beautiful. There is no bidet in the bathroom
Very very fun. At first, I did not like it, but on average it was addictive. The puzzle of the blue jar made me laugh in the end. I am now at the home of Filomel. Me back after finishing. . Thanks be to God ..
Although I am addicted to the degree of mania; but it is very rare when I find a need that I can describe as a real literary creativity case in depicting human relations with all their contradictions, the dark political future, the consistency of events and the genius of the description in all of the above ... Glory to the exit door: a message Ali filled with unexpected joy .... Glory to the genius Ezzedine Shukri Fashir ...
A case of nostalgia, literally passed through portions of it, as the writer lived. Three stars of the narration and a star of the state of memories that the author reminded me of
A good place to stay. good place. nothing
A book very mocked laughing hysterically and I read it::. The combination of horror and comedy is impressive in stories and we can call it. Comedy Horror::. :
I fought alone, in the wind, dream of justice. O wretched prince,. I went alone in the wind dreaming of justice. O Prince of the Dreamers
Cute this writer, even in the term ache. His words are beautiful, but my scent on the paper version is full of drawings that do not rise to the level of Ghazi Al-Qossabi.
Despite so many pictures, there are martyrs they have never been photographed. Their only picture is taken after death. She wept because some of the pictures were not like them, because their faces were deformed by bullets and shrapnel, and by death. . What compels us to sing at the funerals of our martyrs is the one who killed them. The shell came directly to him, a tank shell and flew his face. No one knew him, then they knew him from his clothes, are the clothes clearer than the faces? . Full of pain and hope. Life and death. Full of Palestine and everything looks like Palestine. Ibrahim Nasrallah says God created the horse from the wind, the man from the dust, and the houses from the people of the time of white horses. But it is not only the homes that are created by humans. Stories like this are also created from humans and human remains. And all that has been passed by and passed by them are created from the dust that you clung to and finally hung under it. Created from their moments, joy, and motherhood all. And something from them, houses, horses, and everything. They breathe in them forever to breathe their heavy sorrows that do not die by their death and are born every time we read them within the words of a story created from them. Filled with Palestine and all that was filled with it and its people and all that was filled with it and filled with it from them. We had more hearts to accommodate all these exponents
One of the best hotels I have inhabited. I liked the hotel&#39;s decorations from the lobby to the room, something beautiful, similar to the Garden Hotel in China’s Aquanzo, from the fragrant smell of roses placed at the entrance to the hotel. In a hotel of this beauty after the Chinese hotel. There is nothing amazing
Very beautiful and wonderful content in his name, but I recommend reading it from a verified version:
From what I read the coolest. I benefit a lot. It is easy to find yourself in the four characters, but more importantly, you do not find yourself worse than them. I benefited a lot from the story. Overcome your fears
good. The hotel is economical and is located in the heart of the capital, Riyadh, and the staff is good. The general standard of the hotel corresponds to its pricing and is close to hospitals, where the loan from the visit was to review the hospital.
Of the novels that dazzle you, arouse your enthusiasm, and thinks that it is the best that you have read, but once you close it and with only one day passing by reading it you forget .. but few are the stories that make you stand in front of it amazed, stunned, make you think, change, change your perception of all things around you. You are raised to the top to see the foundations of the highest, purest and purest selves, to see the truth clearly and clearly. You see rampant mold in everything around you, shocked by the fact that the mold comes not only from those around you, but also from within you. Some of the novels are what you can express our feelings: joy, sadness, crying, fear, hope .. You feel it while reading it, so that you can touch it inside you, make yourself confused while you cry with heroes, laugh with them and grieve with them. But few are the stories that frighten you. It is not the horror you feel when reading novels by Stephen King or Adgar Alan Poe. Or what you feel while reading any novel that talks about ghosts and werewolves. Rather, it is your horror while reading a symbolic philosophical novel. The horror that causes you to fear the same fate is what befell the protagonists. After every page, you are afraid to lose your sight or drown in that milky river as the author described it. Sarmago terrified me. The length of my reading of the novel and my eyes are wide open, perhaps due to the ugliness of events, or perhaps it is an instinctive movement for fear of meeting the same fate. How did he manage this suffering and tragedy with this creativity? How to plot plot and events, make you see them in front of you, and live inside them. The novel demonstrated the human nature of man, making him lose only one of his senses, to reveal his instincts, animal nature, and selfishness. He is going wandering on his face, without organization, his first and last concern is to satisfy his instincts. And if he has some power, his second concern is power and control. Was it strange that this woman was the only one who did not lose sight? How can an epidemic approach an angel like her, an angel who feels his responsibility and duty is to help those others who cannot help themselves. You don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re being helped or helped, but rather it&#39;s the call of duty. It is the reason why her eyes remained healthy for him. Like a mother who holds the hand of her child to love without falling down, hold your hand to guide you, so that your eyes are no longer able to see. Like a mother who cleans her baby without disgusting or regretted, she cleanses you of all that is attached to you from the fossil dirt. Like a mother who roars when the danger approaches her children, she is killed if it is the only option to defend her group ... Like a mother who still feels the responsibility towards her children even after they grow up, she still feels her responsibility towards her group, her protection and feeding ... how a pandemic like this to approach From the mass of tenderness, courage and giving like her? His description of city life by the black gangster terrified me. Such an epidemic may reveal the dirty side of the human being, and it may turn a city upside down. He might return it to the first primitive ... His description of their condition without water and food made me wonder, How did the first humans live? It seems easy to get used to the difficulty of life when you find it as it is, but after you and your body get used to progress and technology, it is difficult for you to deal with nature alone. You cannot wait for rain, do not eat flowers and tree leaves, nor search for water wells and cavities. It becomes impossible for you to deal with nature face to face without stages separating you. Tired but after I finished reading it, I feel that I have become more visionary than before; perhaps it is the insight that Sarmago makes you realize and takes your hand to make you touch it inside you, or maybe it is only an appreciation of these eyes, after what you saw from the scourge of blindness. I don’t know exactly, but all I realize is that it changed something internal .. creativity is embodied in words. Done
The hotel is sweet and comfortable. There is nothing wrong. Knock the door of the room early in the morning. Please put a paper. Do not disturb
A book that made me confused about my confusion, does a person spend his life day after day, or stands up to build a decent life, either a decent life or death, writes the planets as if he lives between us and witnesses our condition, I wonder how he drew that picture in the last century, I see him what he would do if he was living now and witnessing All of this tyranny, and how do young people lose their vigor and determination day after day as they face this sweeping flow of thieves who are free in broad daylight? See what he would do. He sees us submissive, deprived of pride and dignity like this .. In my view, I see the first and most important reason for complacency and despotism is education, education in its three main aspects moral education, religious education and scientific education, the fall of education led to individuals accepting submission to other than God, contentment with humiliation for life, This is because they do not understand freedom and appreciate its value, so how do you ask a bird that has been trapped in the cage since its inception to fly and fly in the sky until it opens the door to the cage in front of it, that he does not know how to fly and does not realize his pleasure and the beauty of flying away from the cage and so man, he lost some basic values that raised him to submit And the millet He was satisfied with it until he became palatable .. As for the solutions that he presented, some agreed, and some did not. The most severe thing I agree with is the presence of an alternative solution, otherwise we fall into another tyranny in a new form and a different color, but in the end it is also darkness, but I disagree with him that the solution must be from time Soft and this is what differed in it. When he found the alternative solution, he must confront tyranny with full force, determination and decisiveness. The people of the oppressors must be cut off ... In general, a wonderful book that helps you reflect on the negligence in which we live as a nation, as groups and as individuals.
A beautiful spiritual book bearing one message. God is everything and above everything and greater than everything. No god but you . What is the most beautiful ritual in which the book was sealed and what its thinner ... my Lord, I do not complain, but I hope ... I hope your mercy that expanded everything to help me ... You who expanded your throne of the heavens and the earth ... O Lord, I swore you my weakness and your strength ... I swore to you with my helplessness and power ... except for you made me a way out of my oppression to my light ... and from my light to your light ... Glory be to you there is no god but you ... My God ... grant us your fear, put death in our eyes ... nothing deserves crying except for deprivation of you ... and I am truly sad except for grief on you ... You are the truth..you are what we see of beauty ... wherever an eye looks or listens to an ear Or shave the imagination .. There is no god but you Glory be to You ... If you were unjust ... May God rest his soul, may God rest his soul, Dr. Mustafa Mahmoud.
Exceptional. The hotel is neat and clean and all thanks and appreciation especially to the cleaners.
very good. the place. Swimming pool
good. . The lack of parking at the hotel all the time, which causes a big problem in searching for a position, especially next to the campus
Apartments have great views and excellent location in the Marina. I had a situation that confused me, I am the main City Premier fitter who is on Sheikh Zayed Road near the Dubai Mall. He booked exactly after a long story I went to this hotel and it has many advantages: It is located in the marina and very close to the mall. It has a very wonderful view and I recommend taking an apartment with two bedrooms because it has a fairy and beautiful view and the lounge area is very large, and the floor is parquet, according to my knowledge the apartment with a room One bedroom has a side view, not a look Dictating with the balcony of the same two-room apartment. Near the hotel to the GPR promenade by car, almost minutes. There is an outdoor swimming pool that I have not tried next to the hotel, just a minute&#39;s walk away, a supermarket, as well as a shawarma doner kebab restaurant. In these restaurants, a strong hookah smell is also close to the hotel and the mall has a small marina for boats. It can take you a cruise. The hotel is distinguished because it provides you with all needs and all electrical appliances are available. They saw with us in Albuquerade our brothers from Egypt .. the place is very far from the Dubai Mall and the streets are crowded and it takes time to arrive for that which is planned to go to the Dubai Mall is necessary to come out early or not live in the hotel let him go to the second branch that is on Sheikh Zayed Road but it is closer to other things so your choice of the site must Depending on your trip plans, the negative thing for me may be positive for you, the lobby is very small.
good. Technology in the use of lighting and demand not to disturb and high quality bed and television variety channels and bathroom design method is wonderful and very comfortable and the elevator system that does not climb only through the room key there are no intruders in the same role, and the most beautiful is the view from the room on the city and the Burj Khalifa more than wonderful. The bedspreads were not clean and the duvet was also very surprising, as it is completely opposite to the rest of the hotel services, and it may be the only negative thing
To resist means. Make sure the heart is healthy. And the testes. And the disease that is rooted in you. Hope disease
I loved the book very very much and felt a beautiful feeling as I read it, felt the words close to my heart and their impact on me. I paused a lot of his deep reflections in addition to his high-end language ... It is impossible to read this book without being literally, linguistically, religiously, and in general culturally beneficial. The first book I read for Sheikh Ali Al-Tantawi and it will not be the last, God willing ...
What caught my attention and my anger together is the ability of man to endure and the hobby of hope to open the gates of pain to its owner. The homeland in the novel is the engine of hope, the search for it, and its pursuit of the cause of the unhappiness of the protagonists.
Excellent. The location is beautiful and the hotel is quiet. Comfort. Service level is excellent. nothing
Fine hotel in the full sense of the word. Everything was perfect. nothing
The writer was exposed to the questions that were repeated in his mind, the difficulties he faced in the beginning of Islam and how he was able to overcome them and the situation of the Islamic community in America. The book needs to focus while reading .. My reading of the book changed my view of many things in the field of dealing with non-Muslims, despite my lack of agreement with the author on some matters. The book contains important information, especially for those dealing with non-Muslims or modern Islam
Alcohol is no longer really drunk with a wonderful, deep and light narration at the same time. The language is smooth, neither eloquent nor colloquial, the style is good. I did not feel any boredom. How sweet it is to pass more than sixty years and you are in your place, I liked the succession of generations, I have always lived with every character. Nour Al-Din Hussam Munira started a generation of all differences. Cain, dressed up Abel, most beautifully scared me so unfortunately I understood. I noticed that this era did not differ from the era of Abdel Nasser in the dictatorial aspect. I learned that a good plant when it grows does not produce anything other than good, even if it goes through difficult circumstances. I did not like the excessive personality of Basil and his relationships. The end is the good plant, dazzled
Overall an excellent hotel. Tranquility, cleanliness, parking, basement. My reservation was canceled by the reservation before I arrived, knowing that I arrived at exactly at noon and after arguing, my reservation was replaced by two separate rooms and my reservation was two rooms, a hall, and a kitchen, which caused me inconvenience Wi-Fi is not free
A wonderful book .. A simple explanation and explanation for those who call for separating religion from politics and making it secular by pure ignorance and repeating secularism and they do not understand anything
I cannot describe the greatness of this book,
One of the best novels that I read so hard is something very masterpiece, and the best thing about it is that it is really very realistic, as it is an epidemic of morals, as people considered it in the novel. They will commit suicide and panic, that God did not recognize us from him, and he will return to us what was lost from the tunnel. Indeed, hypocrisy has come out, is the cause of all the problems. These world leaders who lead the world to perdition, which they call politicians who appear other than what they know, and say what they do not announce the deceiving people who mislead people into the darkness of hypocrisy and the darkness of hypocrisy. Indeed, it is the hypocrisy of winning and the epidemic of morality
.. Oh, women’s soreness .. Oh and a thousand ah
This is the first time that I write a comment about one of the novels that I read despite the small number ... wonderful, it is Razavi Ashour ... despite the large number of characters in the novel, but you coexist with each person with the same amount of love and attachment starting from Abu Jaafar and Umm Jaafar And bliss to Salima, Hassan, Saad, and the appearance of the beautiful Mary in the midst of events and fall in love with his rose and Kawthar ... A generation delivers you to a generation and moves from a city to a city without feeling distracted or bored ... You live their love and joy and their concern is like you The protagonist of the long life, Granada is crying as Ali and Maryam cried.
good. The price is excellent. There are no positions
Very beautiful, create a Mahmoud Mahmoud Bakry, and an unexpected end
It is the narration as it should be. Talal Faisal presented it in a way that made the characters read with me what was written on their tongue and told me their experience with Naguib Surour. All their feelings came to me from the love of his wife, the hatred of his brother, and the respect of Dr. Jalal to him and his greatness, Najib. Sorour, who is the most wise of our time. Because my acquaintance with Nagib Sorour before the novel was not more than an illiterate poem, so the narration was an important reason, so my idea of his personality was completely changed. We answer Sorour. Once I finished it, I read an office that was necessary and Yassin’s play was wonderful, in addition to a narration without his queens and after information about the Khursa brigade and Abu Al-Ula Al-Maarri The novel was an introduction to the life of Naguib Surour. The views of Naguib Sorour impressed me on those who considered the great people of this era, from Salah Juheen, Naguib Mahfouz and Abdel Wahab, and even Umm Kulthum and Abdel Halim, and I was more impressed by the strength of the dialogue that took place between Naguib Surur and Naguib Mahfouz in the Abbasid Hospital and detailing his famous recording session of the illiterate poem. I consider pleasure story the best documentary novel of a biography that I read in my life. I do not see any candidate better than Talal Faisal to write a similar one on the story of my life if I reach this limit of importance someday.
A novel that inhabits every girl. I created Ahlam Mostaghanemi in this novel as usual
Exceptional. . The lack of parking parking i
I hadn&#39;t read to Emily previously and it happened by beautiful chance, regardless of Emily and I will not talk about it, as it spoiled genius. Turktera Tash was seeing life from a black and radiant detail window, and not everyone saw radiation. The novel is very strong and the papers are full of genius water, I am not very much dazzled, but I think I will not be very dazzled after reading this beautiful bad novel.
When we meditate, we will discover something beautiful and amazing ... not necessarily an invention ... perhaps even more beautiful than that. ... a smile that we did not notice ... or a heart that we had not felt before ...
The most beautiful hotels in Jeddah. The entry procedures are very fast as well as the exit. There is no
The only thing that prevented me from reading this book in one go .. It is between a while and the other. The sarcastic writing in his simple, naughty style ... What I liked most about this book .. was recognized by the new Muslims .. and like Egypt is almost like a ball .. And a way to get rid of the book .. And a paragraph describing the girl of his dreams .. The book in its entirety is very cool for anyone who loves tipping ... and loves to ridicule the situation of the country and people ..
Wonderful ... one of the greatest readings of my life
good. Comfortable and value for service, good and clean. The services provided do not rise to a four-star rating service. The cafeteria, restaurant, buffet, reception, room and bathroom services are all very normal classification. Less than three stars, please develop.
Its effect is Raaaaaaaaaae. Very interesting book. Especially the forgetting phone
You do not read the owner of the shadows here. You read for the agonized lover at one time and for the lover companion at another time .. Although the story was written at the beginning of his literary career, it was filled with deep philosophy, intellectual reflections, and careful analysis of many passing situations, but his literary style here was the weakest.
Enjoyable stay. Comforts.
An interesting and realistic novel, but it can be summarized in less than a page .. Why all these details that lead the reader to the desire to skip and overlook some lines
Nice experience. . The food was excellent for both lunch and breakfast. When I arrived I wanted to cancel the reservation for the third room and was not allowed to do so. The amount shown on the reservation site is not a lump sum without taxes and this is bad because the amount you paid is more.
The second book I read for Mustafa Mahmoud..and as usual, the book is wonderful and opens doors in the mind I thought of it closed or forbidden Jayes and the most beautiful distinctive need in the style of Mustafa Mahmoud in general the extreme simplicity in dealing with complicated topics such as de But in order to repeat and lengthen some points and get away from the topic sometimes, but the overall book is very useful and worth reading
Sultanate of Oman Haitham Al-Badi. everything. nothing
Much more beautiful than expected New Year&#39;s party .. The place looks beautiful and the party is very organized .. The place is large and has extensive gardens and a huge swimming pool .. All the staff were friendly and also responsible for the guest relations, which provided us with the data that needed to know and in fact the The previous comment is what made me remember her name. I think she is the same girl forbade .. My friends and I had good times there with good memories.
Imaginary . everything. The room is in the room
good. Transportation, area of the rooms, frequent fingers, parking and family comfort. Not having enough insulation between the rooms and the bathroom is not good enough
One of the most important reasons for enjoying travel. The place of residence is one of the most important reasons for enjoying travel. The place of residence. I stayed in the hotel for one night with a suite and two executive rooms. Six people. The hotel is new, clean, quiet and overlooks the Bosphorus.
I know love but. I chanted, I am waiting. My lips dried up. And my soul withered. And the body is Gaara. In my forests, a wound that does not heal. And in my desert there is no flame. When my poet. A desert is extinguished. And when my forests complete an explosion. I have prepared my heart for you. And from love a jacket. She pondered over. And I got hurt again. If your pulse fired bullets. And your songs howling. Your feelings are dead. And your wishes are prisoners. And if you are a relic. From ash and shrapnel. Wind blows it slowly and scatter it. You never know what love is. And I was in vain waiting for. . God&#39;s mercy on your heart, female. I do not apologize. I know love, but. I had no choice. The flood of sorrow was wasting my chest. And love was a fire ..... hid. It was sun. And he disappeared when the night folded during the day. A bird was singing over my cilia. When the hunter came, he flew. Oh if the rulers were not fired. In my skin dogs compete. Oh if they didn&#39;t fill my blood stream with oil. My breath is dust. Oh if they hadn&#39;t planted tears. Spies on my eyes. Oh if they didn&#39;t apply the blockade around me. I revealed my poems to my grandfather. Just as a cloud is dissolved in deserts. And sheathed magic in slaughter. And in the gap. And in the chest. And in all parts of the cold and free. And it lit the sailors. And for the stones. I hid a woman in my pocket. And Nizara was abolished. I know the love I am. But my love. He died hanging from an arterial cord. The dungeon of my heart. Do not think that he died a suicide .. Do not think that Dalia dried up. It did not bear fruit. Do not think it is love like a mess. If he had an effort to walk to Sara. Do not think and forgive him and me. I play tears. And I am bloodied. I live in remembrance. I have no time in my secret. To sing for drunks. Please excuse me. If I switched off my melodies. And I dropped the curtain. .... I do not have a false heart
Nice experience and I will be back again. The breakfast is delicious and the place is great and beautiful. Parking
When the professor talks, everyone should be silent, and silence is forbidden in the beauty of beauty ... What is this magnificence in photography .. I did not find the most wonderful of him in describing the human soul&#39;s theses .. One of the most beautiful stories that I read ...
I recommend the hotel and I will repeat the experience later, God willing. Everything and thanks are due to Brother Yusuf, whom I have not had the chance to meet despite his efforts with us. The absence of paintings on Dubai roads indicating the Festival City area
I recommend it to families. Surprised at some of the comments, I lived in the hotel and found it very wonderful. Fast login and faster exit, the presence of wonderful balconies and views, and in the eighth floor there is a section for children, a nursery, games and special programs for them and the presence of a swimming pool for adults and children. Excellent hygiene despite the fact that the furniture is an old model and needs renewal. The size of the rooms and I do not recommend listening to some exaggerated negative opinions. I also wish the hotel management to reconsider the pricing.
Exceptional. Great and cheap hotel suitable for families There are no wines or discos in the hotel more than ten times I live in my favorite hotel. nothing
The focus of the book or the issue that the writer wants to prove in his book is that the world and the hereafter are one way and that religion is the primary ruler and that proverbs are of an hour&#39;s quality for your heart and an hour for your Lord and no religion in politics and religion for God and the nation for all are empty proverbs that do not aim For nothing other than emptying religion from its real content ... The writer managed to communicate his idea strongly and what I liked most about the book is its ease, clarity and ability to derive what is inside the crusts. Meaning confirms the greatness of this religion and how it is the immortal miracle of God .... This book is my beginning T with Mtabat Professor Muhammad Qutb and the praise of God a good start
I like it. The hotel is great place, service, cleanliness and even cafes. Small swimming pool
A book that is very rich in knowledge, answered some of my questions, and emphasized many of my expectations .. It also opened a door for me to think about some things from different aspects .. He added me a lot in many areas, as it was not limited to religious proofs, but many of the sciences overlapped in All parts of the book .. A distinguished book, stemming from the mind of its encyclopedia, definitely worth reading.
There is a lot of common sense in the depositor, and the last thing written by Dr. Ghazi Al-Qossabi, may God have mercy on him, was to describe the patient’s condition with Alzheimer&#39;s, his sadness and physical poison in conveying the news of his death to his wife at the end of the book
very good. . The hotel is very far from the beach and the picture in the internet is close to the beach. This is a false picture.
The best hotels in Dubai. Fine service, great hygiene, full kitchen, spacious rooms, elegant location. nothing
: //. The truth of the novel de conquered me:. The facts of Katiyeier showed very little what they knew before. I expressed the revolution by what you get. I expressed the suffering of people and what could be reached if the situation is preferred as it is. In spite of their suffering, there is a good thing in them. No hard novel above description. She shocked me, cried, excited me, blindfolded me, and moved every need
Exceptional. The hotel is very excellent and its value is the hotel as well. The hotel staff is very helpful and very close to the entertainment and shopping places and I highly recommend it for families. there is nothing
good. . They asked us to pay the full amount via the card at the time of attendance and at checkout they asked us to pay the card again and then we refused to pay because the amount was withdrawn and the receptionist insisted on the payment and then the reception manager came and he was understood that the amount withdrew and does not need to pay again.
I finished it for a while. One day I remember it the most that compliments me because it contains a strange black quantity. A beautiful novel
A very beautiful novel that deserves good reputation and fame and, of course, the Poker Prize ... very enjoyable in a smooth manner ... It draws you from the beginning. The translation makes you think of it as a Filipino novel translated into Arabic, surprising that the writer is Kuwaiti, not realizing the truth except in the last lines of the novel in a very short translation made it a narration closer Reality from fiction, and there are actually many similar stories, so if Jesus and Josephine were a novel that we read, then we can be sure that the reality includes many of them who are similar to them with different details .. The tyranny of customs and traditions was not made by us but we became not enjoying our lives for fear of our social status which was often not to A we are the reason we obtained it but inherited it, it plagiarized a lot of pleasure and joy from us, on the apparent that it differs a lot from inside us, we are dispersed .. so when we sanctify habits that God did not descend from Sultan .. they do not differ a lot from us they had great aspirations such as Josephine that was She aspires to finish her studies and get a good job, many of them are chaste women whose difficult circumstances limited them to work in homes and did not want vice, such as Josephine when she said my master left my country to escape such things, and she also asked him to confirm after the marriage was this only we become a couple? She was not sure yet that Rashid had rightly become her husband. They are humans just like us. According to the reference, except that we enter religion and bring it into our affairs as we wish, and in this we do harm to ourselves first and foremost. As for religion, it is preserved by God and sanctification .. As is always the case, not everything that a person develops understands, and the reality is not like imagination, I never wish an adult death, There is no return of Jesus to the Philippines and his surrender, even though he has the right to enjoy living in Kuwait, as it is better materially than the Philippines, like any Kuwaiti, but this thing won the novel a lot of realism ... Saud Al Sanousi ..
Great hotel. Quiet and very clean hotel and the degree of honesty is very high, the safety was excellent, the level of service is distinct and professional and the most important thing is the hotel is close to everything, I was enjoying going down the hotel wonderfully and my daughters were enjoying the place .. none.
War is peace ... freedom is slavery ... ignorance is power, these are the principles of the party and the phrase that serves the strongest ideology in all totalitarian regimes ... a beautiful novel written by Arthur Rick and when it was said that for all time it was not wrong, so by measuring all events you find that you You see it in your life in a system that governs you in the grip of the big brother who wants to control everything, even those that concern you, such as feelings and dreams .. The hero Winston and his girlfriend Julia, their crime was a crime of thought. Loyalty is lack of awareness and thinking means for the monitoring services and the thought police is a crime .. The room happens what the big brother wants, faces the culprit with his fears and what happened with Smith Winston Gossi Brain, beat himself and loved in the last Big Brother .... successfully propagated brainwashing process.
I am a follower of people from different directions of the revolution, but they share a need when Mustafa Ibrahim&#39;s biography comes. All of them say, Mawlana. Now you know Mawlana, what does it mean?
Relax. Location of the hotel, room. Bathroom, place design. The length of lanes and the absence of a delivery trolley The difficulty of knowing where to control the lights
Diameter . I thank them for their efforts in giving me a large wing instead of my small wings for the same price.
The book is very, very, very good..In a lot of people, it sure attacked and criticized it because it attacked many idols from people with a delight in its worship..you will see content shocking and disbelieving and claiming immorality and promiscuity due to the call to respect the freedom of the other ... an invitation to fanatics and extremists. I wish you could be freed from your chains an hour of time..and read the book neutrally and rationally ... there is no need for your blood to flow and your reactions to me with our sense that you are responsible for the universe..this book will help you ... one last point..i like the last topic to me talking about the language and Their levels and the link between them ..
If he returned a groom, he would have chosen it for the first night. Clean, comfortable, quiet, close to campus, sophisticated staff deserves. The internet service was not working for a malfunction
Wonderful. crew. Stairway positions
Al-Tantouriya is a novel that taught me and taught me how much I am ignorant and I know nothing about Palestine. We always say Palestine suffers and our people in Palestine are persecuted and they all suffer words I thought I understood and I did not really feel it except when I read Al-Tantooriya. I was ashamed of myself reading it
good. Quiet location.
Excellent. The place, hygiene, psychological comfort, and beauty of the hotel. There are no comprehensive offers with the suite, such as breakfast, for example.
Medech five stars from a while. Void laughing or rather chuckling as long as you browse cartoons. All comics revised from before. A book in his time
I would have given her stars had it not been for her open end. I hate these ends .. I am looking at what will happen at the end of the novel until I reach the last page, so I find the option open to the reader&#39;s imagination. Regardless, it is a beautiful novel with a distinctive idea..and its style of writing is fun.
Exceptional. Location and calm. The furniture is old and the breakfast is small
Their events kept me intact in all their details, and they kept me secretly and soon to do so until I came to my consciousness and woke up to the sound of a missile or missile hitting, while another bullet stole a new soul. Wonderful in everything, from her words to her strength and difficulty, to the complexities and contradictions of her reality. That archer Ibrahim Nasrallah hit his target precisely
Natures of tyranny and wrestler slavery to Abdul Rahman Al-Kawakibi. Although the book was written more than a hundred years ago, it is not like tonight yesterday. I recommend reading this book as long as there are nations suffering from tyranny. The book will remain a reference more than adequate to the nature of tyranny and how to get rid of it.
And filled them Tamaaaaaaaaam =
fantastic place . Cleanliness and comfort. The second bathroom in the apartment was narrow and lack of positions
wonderful wonderful wonderful . Beautiful style and very smooth expression. A very, very, very deep description of an individual’s feelings in these difficult circumstances. Each important line can not be excluded or neglected any part of the story ... I made me cry and very shocked by the cruelty and realism of the events, unfortunately. I was very touched by the story and all its decisions in one day, despite my concern, I could not leave the book until after I gave it away and knew its end. Beautiful and very respectful style, completely different from the usual style of Arabic novels. A wonderful description of all human conflicts. I benefited and knew the natures of the peoples of the two countries. I am very happy to read this book, which is at the top of my favorite books list. He deserves a thousand prizes and not only the Arab Poker Prize
I listened to his reading just as I was agonized ... mocking with pain ... laughing mixed with groans and tears. A good book for quotes
good. The location is close to the markets. The services provided by the reception staff are very poor because there is one person and they wait a minute on the floor to ask a question. Does this make sense for a large hotel like your hotel? Thank you
The unknown that we frantically search for without knowing why and where, death and adjacent life, whether in the maze of government circles or between the surface and the surface of the earth, without Jose the only name among the characters of the novel lives in a middle filled with abstract names but when he searched for one of them he discovered that Names hide many letters between her, he personally did not recognize himself much and left himself for many internal complications and dialogues created by Saramago with a philosophy, irony and exciting diversity ,, the novel ended and the search for the unknown did not end and all contradictions remained adjacent ,,, a wonderful novel
This is the first novel I read to Hakim, but it certainly will not be the last except for the play Madness River. I never expected, before starting, to laugh with all my heart and enjoy all this joy. A wonderful work in a critical and satirical style that talks about those laws imported from abroad that are not appropriate for the Egyptians and that the simple Egyptian people cannot understand and that is in a beautiful and very funny style that made me increase love for the Egyptian people in general and his satirical book in particular. I think that the only weakness is that it will not be understood by everyone to the same extent .. With the exception of the Egyptians and who understands the Egyptian accent and the fact that the Egyptian people are simple, I think that someone who will read them will miss a lot of fun and hidden meanings between their lines and the fact that I was surprised a lot when I learned that they Localized for a large number of languages
A group of wonderful articles. I think part of it chronicles the time period, and the rest is criticized and reprimanded for the situation in America and Iraq
A book worth reading and meditating on its words, simple and clear, far from complications .. I choose your life and your reality as you like it as your choice for your daily coffee I enjoyed so much.
Wonderful. nice place.
A very sweet fortune that reads the novel before the movie is shown .... The film is a deformed deformation with regard to the creativity of the novel.
Children who did not feel the value of their mother&#39;s existence in their lives until after she lost it. But then what is it too late ..
And not the most amazing truth .. The feelings of Bilal, Abeer, Azza and Amr are the same idea. Their dialogues are capable of transporting people from one world to another.
A nice, cute and light book with sweet notices
I am not fighting to win, but rather to lose my right. Khaled Al-Haj Mahmoud ... a wonderful novel that depicts the history of Palestine during the period of Turkish slavery, until the British abdication of power in favor of the Jews. Tired of events, and many are disappointments, we ask God for an urgent victory other than God, Lord.
Rest and recuperation. The cleanliness, the large area of the suite, the speed with which requests are met, the location ... the menu is too expensive.
The book&#39;s layout is beautiful in terms of colors and pictures. The book is divided into sections. The first talked about the reason for concern about signs and rules in dealing with them. The second minor signs that have occurred and have not yet occurred. The writer spoke of them in some detail or brevity, and perhaps a division of one of the signs occurred in its place. The Three Great Signs. What I liked most about the book is mentioning any shapes, caution, or clarification with a square and answering it, as many of them were going on in my mind =. I do not know why I enjoy so much Al-Areefi&#39;s books and love to redeem them quickly and read them again ..
It was an enjoyable visit, and I hope to repeat it again. The proximity to the campus and breakfast and the hotel staff treat is excellent. The positions are narrow and limited
United Arab Emirates . The services are fast .. the rooms are clean .. the breakfast is good .. the location is excellent ...
good. Frankly, sweet location, excellent reception service and cleanliness. Coffee shop is missing in the morning
Ibrahim Essa if you followed him neutrally and not baffled him or against him. It is people who can attract you to him and to his writing. A tightly written novel, sketch and description with interest for the characters. But the empty filling and narration was more than the core of the events. In his novel, he retaliated against the ruling regime, but in a way that would not cross the mind of the length of the novel. Through the brother-in-law of the president&#39;s son, it is a really great loophole. I liked some of Mawlana Hatim Al-Shinnawi&#39;s propaganda terms and as elders they say they are peelings of religion, that is, its surface. They do not say its depth because they do not find anyone who understands it or funds it for the media, but the scales are funded. Of course, I will not judge my disagreement or my agreement with him on any religious matters, because they are based on fake characters. The bottom line is that the novel defects it in its literary rulings and the style of narration and dialogue is colloquial Ali Foshi. I believe from my point of view that it was cut off from writing, then it is a good novel, but it is a good novel.
Those messages charged with all that frustration, confusion and questions, full of pain and pain and sometimes happiness after a long wait ... all those feelings, including what makes us cry and some that paint our lips a smile of hope again. From the experiences of others, we derive wisdom, hope, and recitation ... As for the wonderful Abdul Wahab Mutawa, what should I say in order to give him his full right? We must mourn the loss of such a wise heart ... Our Lord, have mercy on your sweet soul, your kind heart and your wise mind ..
The book is wonderful, new, and beautiful. It is in general and very simple style. The writer is a smart thinker and observer of life.
I do not replace the sorrows of my heart with the joys of people, nor am I satisfied that the tears that depression bring from my souls turn and I laugh, I hope that my life will remain a tear and a smile ... a tear and a smile, a group of prose stories and poems that express Gibran’s thought, and the same thoughts and reflections in life In it he talked about love, nature, beauty, friends, separation, death, pain, memories, poverty and perfection ... His style is very elegant and elegant book that crushes reading
The most wonderful hotel I lived in Dubai at a very cheap price. everything. nothing
Wonderful, but not suitable for the elderly. The reception staff are excellent, the buffet is varied and the hotel is generally clean. Away from the Holy Mosque meters
Excellent. The rooms are comfortable, sleeping and excellent services. there is nothing
Let me say that this book is in its time awwow due to the terrible wit it contains. The one actually felt that he bought the handbook on his wish:. The topics in it are all of your life .. the life of each one of us is with your family .. the faces of your apartment .. with your brother .. your atmosphere. Criticism, but with good taste ,, Laughter, but respectable .. The book looked in the metro People read with you and shake its head in what its meaning means. In college, all to sit with me, refuse, laugh, and treat us, and we conclude the book with the last chapter in it, and understand that life is not easy, and not everyone says it to a friend:. Wow, waiting for the next one, and enjoying the review, not the place, but the next time I will be more trained ..
Well ... I have to admit that I came out of this book with questions, not that knowledge that Muhammad Hassanein Heikal and Sami Al-Droubi promised me. I feel that I need some time to absorb the novel and absorb the shock .. The novel is closer to history than to literature .. They considered me foolish but they answered me:. Did Andic not write his novel along the lines of traditional historical novels, Jerji Zidan, and if we agreed that it is more professional, so to speak? Then does the bridge simply symbolize the fall and decline of civilizations? Is there no job for the bridge in the rear? I tried to penetrate into internal details more than external conditions ... the thing that tired me. But all I hope for is that I digest the novel .. Good, esophagus
Excellent. The place is very clean. Lack of parking spaces for Parken
Barbara is dead .... there is an oil painting of her blazing in orange, yellow and purple colors illuminated chest of the library room .... It is painful that I will not see her or hear her voice again ... I get angry when I see things moving away ... All these changes The cruel accompanying old age. I want my friends to be here always and for the places to remain the same and for this amount of voices, faces and names to stop decreasing ... I do not want to touch my path as a blind person who breaks into new places but I want those places that welcome my return with a tolerant smile in this bitter presence ... I want To reside in my homeland .... And my first homeland was my books .. Manguel returns to the stages of his young age using books he previously read over a whole year .... He recovers ideas and sayings and weaves them with a colorful fabric detailing his daily life and his travels between cities, comparing both The old and new fabrics show global events, imparting personal thoughts about them. Contrary to my opinion, Mangwell describes this notebook as a little beauty and less intelligent, but enthusiastic, despite its shortness.
Very beautiful and fun
one of the best I have ever read. A charming novel
more than great . The location and the screen of the staff. Tight bathroom
I remember while I remember that I have read or started reading this book in the past, but the memory does not help me with a final decision on this even after finishing re-reading it again .. Of course everyone who reads this book realizes the frightening and confusing similarities with the state of Egypt these days and of course The splendor of this book lies in the ability to predict and extrapolate what the situation will be based on the actions of governments and the morals of the people .. What I liked most about Utopia is that it is not only a social account of what the writer expects to happen within ten years, but the attempt to extrapolate within the reasons The results and motives behind this farce are an attempt to read For the same humanity and the reader’s involvement of the same personalities while trying to reach the motives and reasons behind their actions and beliefs, a utopia discusses human greed in the lowest form, the ability to transform mental and logical abilities to keep pace with the surrounding environment, trying to understand or extrapolate where things go to us .. Jabir has some hatred He has intelligence, cowardice, courage, nobility in the middle of this quagmire, and of course, his sister, Safia, defends with all his might the power of her will and the freedom of her choices, as Rasim says ... Germann, the innocent and insignificant girl, and how inside is still clean despite all her sins .. and the most important character She is the utopian boy who doesn&#39;t The writer committed himself to his name, and if he had known himself to the jealousy with Alaa, the mysterious figure who would almost understand him at the beginning of the novel and then be disgusted by his actions and that internal darkness that governs his actions, the insignificance of himself, which is revealed in his words when he attacked Safiye .. Side characters such as Al-Sarjani and Azza and Sumaya and Abd al-Zahir also devise for her psychological dimensions that are intertwined throughout the events .. The novel discusses consumer religion, morals and many other social and psychological dimensions..I only fault with the novel that you feel while reading it that you are watching an American movie translated, even if this brings the language closer and Juvenile breeding events to watch these movies may be Justified in the events of the novel to overlap the Egyptians with the Marines and the Israelis, but he sometimes dominated the narrative in my opinion, which reduces the affiliation of Arabic literature and an example of this I really hate his guts, as the Americans say. Jaber and Germinal after him summarize the painful situation in Utopia in the poem Abd al-Rahman al-Abnudi, we are two peoples, two peoples, two peoples ... Look first, where is the time? And performed the line between the two Pivot ........
The price is overrated. The location is excellent and the reception staff are respectful and helpful. The price is very, very exaggerated. There are many furnished apartments in the same neighborhood, specifically on the same street. But the price is much cheaper.
I hesitated a lot before starting it. The title did not attract me much. But I did not regret reading it at all. Very nice. It appears that it is a biography of the author, in which he talks about his childhood and talks about his hometown Abha. Much has been mentioned about village life, herding and customs in it. And he talked about the many and intellectual stages he went through in his life. He started entering the school for memorizing the Qur’an and the cruelty and ill-treatment he received from teachers there. Then his transfer and friction with a group that made him an extremist fundamentalist, through which he almost became a terrorist. Then the last shift in his personality to become moderate and discover his mistake. And he talked about all his feelings and feelings in every stage he lived in. There is much to quote on this book that I strongly like. It will not be my last reading of this author. I liked it:
Very beautiful hotel. The location, cleanliness, size of the wings and view are all beautiful and breakfast is also included. nothing
The story of Rajab Ismail, the human .. Another wonderful Munif masterpieces.
The Bab Al-Shams novel, by Elias Khoury, talks about the migration of Palestinians from the north to Lebanon and their lives in the camps.
Fear will always exist, man can destroy everything in himself; love, faith, hate, and even suspicion, but no matter how much life is extended to him, he will not be able to destroy fear ... Joseph Conrad. In the life of each of us, the event that we do not return ourselves to, always changes some paths and things within us, to scatter us and rearrange us again ... A life occurred in each of the characters of the story, an accident, those accidents vary in severity and impact directly with the future by including M, breaking the scourge, a tragedy, changed the course and meaning of everything ... the circumstances have always kept us away from people and ourselves, to unite us with our fear and our hope, they were not the same at all the characters of the story, but a break that made the similarity between them terrible ... the novel embodies the details of pain, refraction, Weakness, surrender, collapse and recovery, and that things that are broken in us may be restored with th Time, will and some help, except that we do not always return ourselves ... you will see the physician homeless, the murderer is a psychiatrist, and the outrageous rich woman is dysfunctional, and the wife is at the top of conspiracy ... the vast differences between the classes of society will be material and civilized, and the vast difference between the layers of ourselves and the difference It convinced us ... the novel permeated some gaps, some defects in the context, in the details, but the great writer&#39;s effort to correct some concepts and urged us to rise was overwhelming, regardless of his success or failure in it .... :. Regardless of the first impression that everyone will bear, depending on the name ..
Now ... here ... it is the eastern Mediterranean again with more pain, detail and intense grief accompanying them .... it has something you cannot believe although you know it ... it is unconscious, it suffices what you know .... on the margin / I don&#39;t know Who called this type of books literature of prisons, there is no literature for prisons .. Political imprisonment is a shame on homelands, and homelands are nothing but their people.
He is not the first person to compose himself. But he is the first person to insist on writing about himself. Despite the misery and misery of his life. He showed offense to sodomy. He hated his father and even beat him to him. He was not shy about exposing himself to the book. Perhaps it is not a crime as much. What big criminals do. Who among us has no errors and mistakes. Who among us is the angel?
good. . I did not like the price of the burkin is more expensive than the hotel price per day
Very excellent and I recommend trying it to see the top of the focus and the aromatic scents I did not expect in perfume with this wonderful and excellent smell
Enjoyable stay and delicious breakfast. Everything is excellent, the hotel is not stars, but stars in my opinion, and the crew is very excellent, especially Mr. Mohamed and Mr. Harry. nothing
Dangerous as usual. With my objection to some words. Just a solution:
for work . Easy to reach.
good. Calm and location. Lack of options in breakfast and low level of hygiene in the dining hall, as well as the lack of parking lots, as well as the concert hall, its entrance from the same main gate, which causes crowding
This book is wonderful with its many historical and linguistic information that if written by only Dr. Youssef Zidan, when I could not comprehend it, nor trace its interactions and its causes ... but in his simplified, concentrated, serialized style, the book became a masterpiece of creative value with creative knowledge. Beginning from ancient religions and their myths until the beginning of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, and how all religions are innocent of what the religious claim and do in the name of religion and based on their interpretation of religious texts. A deep and rich philosophical historical book sheds light on many things and events that explain the origins and rationale for religious whirlpools.
Wonderful. Very cool hotel quiet clean salary.
In the style of dreams, something of magic that makes you enjoy what you read, even if you do not agree with him at all ... you feel as if they are able to speak the same language as Arab poets. This book has an invaluable value, as I frequent it from time to time. But be careful not to indulge your personality in it as it sends in something negative from depression. The sweetest thing in the book is that it only addresses the female ... Every time I look at the cover, smile, I wrote dreams on it, it is forbidden to sell it to men
The highest hotel in the world. Breakfast and brunch. The site needs a car
business trip . The reception staff were always smiling, especially brother Ahmed, and his proximity to places. The lack of attitudes was very bad
Perhaps this novel is actually as some described it is not valid to be a childish story and perhaps it does not discuss intellectual issues in this depth, but it is without a doubt that touches something inside each of us touches a certain side common to all of us as part of our common humanity. I think it really is one of the most wonderful things I simply read its style, aesthetics and humanity with its high literary texts. She discusses fundamental issues, but simply beautiful. I think it is really necessary that she be at the top of the list of books that startups begin their cultural and intellectual journey. Greetings to Dr. Imad Zaki and everyone who walked the path of glory and narrated it with his tears, his sweat and perhaps his blood
I was in the process of collecting my thoughts and final observations about the novel, when I got to the last pages, and if Dostoevsky surprised me with these lines in which he responded to the words that began gathering themselves to confront him, he wrote: I admit that I do not wish to be a novelist depicting a hero who is a member of a family coincidentally an effort without fruit and beauty. These models are still from the current life in any case, so they cannot be complete with aesthetic. How can the writer avoid errors, exaggerations and omissions here? It will be for the writer or reader to guess and go overboard with guessing what remains for a writer who does not want to be limited to historical narratives .. Rather, it dominates the desire to write about what is current reality? To guess and .. to make mistakes. . Similar names are a basic problem in the novel, where I had to stop and check for sure about any character who was speaking, my first reading of Dostoyevsky, an intimate novelist, speaking from within the characters of his novel, from the heart of her fears and dreams, we approach through him to man, and the teenage novel is only a long reflection on This strange creature .. Quotes :. Neither do you know what to do, nor do I know what to do, when the Russian, when he went out of the way for which the custom drew him, did not know what to do. On the road, everything is clear: income, rank, status in society, vehicle, visits, position, woman. What remains of me at the first deviation from the paved road? A paper winded by the wind, I don&#39;t know what to do. I tried in these two months to stay in the drawn road, and I wanted to love the drawn road, and I dug into this drawn road. . It is an interesting and interesting thing to see what the views of the high society people feel about each other, and on what basis they respect each other. . Why is life so short this whole palace? Most probably, the goal of shortening it is not to be boring, because life is also an artwork of the works of the Greatest Creator, drafted in complete final form as a poem by Pushkin. Brevity is the first condition of art. But those who are not bored should be allowed to live longer. . Simplicity, dear, simplicity is the most cunning. . He has a wide mind, but his heart is worried. . But this love that the strong holds for the weak is sometimes much more violent and painful than the love between two equal, because the strong bear the responsibility of his weak friend despite his will. . A person cannot live without prostration. Without prostration, man cannot bear himself. . How could all the feelings of peace and the joys of the armistice all combine with the beating of my dying, unruly, painful, delicious pain, and with the appalling stormy decisions that I intend to make? I do not know. . Laughter. Atheism. Suicide. Suicide is the biggest sin of a person. But the Lord is the only ruler, because He alone knows everything, standards and limits. It is our duty to pray to God for the examples of these great sinners. If you have heard of such a sin as this sin, pray to its confused supplication before you sleep, and intercede with the Lord even if you do not know him, and if you do not know him, your intercession will be more beneficial as well. . But are they many of those who stand and persist in caring for others ’happiness? If the money is not a god, then it is half a deity. . A lock in theories and utter ignorance of life. . Sadness mixes with joy whenever years pass, then it becomes impossible for a happy exhale. This is how things happen in this world: every soul is tested and comforted. . A human being is a device that informs of the complexity that a person cannot understand anything, especially if this person is a woman. . But it seems to me that when a person has a large part of culture, he cannot express his victorious victorious happiness. . Russian women come down to them quickly, and their beauty expires. . As if this human being had surprised her by a fixed idea, so she was very tormented because she is beyond her powers. . Their weapon was always logic. Where logic is, boredom. . So, humans realize that they are completely alone, and suddenly they feel abandoned orphaned. . To tighten what they will hasten to love, in order to suffocate the great sadness in their hearts. . My friend, I suddenly felt that serving the idea never absolved me, as an ethical and sane person, from the happiness of at least one human being during my life, practical happiness. . The educated, superior person who seeks a supreme idea turns his back on daily life sometimes, so he becomes ridiculous and funny, becomes freaky, becomes cool, and I even say frankly that he becomes stupid, in practical life of course. . All that he possessed of freedom had disappeared at once when that meeting was, and the man found himself forever drawn to a woman who had nothing in common between her. . Your whole culture and culture has cost you torture and fights that you have fought throughout your life, but it has received perfection for free. This is not equal in anything. This is what arouses frustration in women. . You have a tough soul, the same woman. Mama was demolished a demolition. . One can speak with words what he wants, and indicate with words anything. As for deciding, legislating, and implementing .. this needs special printing and strong grievance. I marry him because I will be quieter with him than I am with another. Then keep myself whole for me. . There is no doubt that I abuse you. This is a severe fancy flaw. One thing I know is that if I was with you I had finished, and if I was absent from you I would have finished too. As long as I am with you and without you, you are always with me wherever you are. I know that I can hate you more than I can love you ... This naive and humiliating hope awakens compassion in the soul and stabs the heart with a strong stab with enough frankness and the impossibility of it. . All the features of her face were distorted by pain. . However, what matters to us more than anything else is that we finally have a system, whatever this system is, provided that it is a system for us that is hope, and that is comfort if you will. Something that is finally completed, not this eternal undermining, and these cacophony flying all over the place, and this waste and this dirt from which nothing comes out nearly two hundred years ago. . He is a woman with no religion, yet ready to die almost for an unspecified thing that he cannot name, but he has a suspicious belief in him.
good. The hotel is new, there is a distance to the sanctuary due to maintenance work on the sanctuary, new room. Upon arriving at the hotel, I was surprised that the receptionist asked for a different amount than the reservation price, and in contact with the customer services, when I paid the extra amount, the bed cover was not clean.
This is a great hotel, but there are still some remarks this year that we went back to the Hotel des Cascades. It is still a great hotel but we had some minor problems. The comprehensive menu was ok but there was a limited amount of drinks to choose from and only local drinks were included. We would be grateful if more wine selections are available. We had hoped for some development as we were returning visitors we had visited this place before. We got a room with a beautiful view of the Red Sea. The golf courses were in good condition, however the vet was not deep enough and needed some attention. One day, unfortunately, the stadium was crowded with too many players, so we had to wait over a minute after our time to start. The break took more than hours and this is a very long time. In the middle of the week a large group of local residents came to the hotel. This has greatly affected the general atmosphere. The hotel was not prepared to entertain children and most guests came to play golf and enjoy a quiet day at the pool. But with this large group it was not possible to calm the afternoon at the pool. Finally, I would like to ask the administration to prevent smoking in the Eagle&#39;s Bar, smoking in this bar created a bad public atmosphere and made our clothes smell of smoke.
This woman is not desperate ... she is called despair in the hope that I will show her another way.
The best Umrah. The cleanliness of the rooms and the furniture is fine. The handling of the crew is complete, as is the breakfast buffet. There is no
With the acceleration of events in our Arab world, this wonderful novel came and its timing is excellent. What is wrong with my opinion is the title only. Not like the title of his previous novel The Bamboo Shank The name was Ranan by itself. As for the novel itself, it is a piece of beauty
I liked the novel. Perhaps Ihsan Abdul Quddus did not write in a difficult literary style but touched the hearts as he focused on a problem between the son from a mother from a different race from the father, which caused him the psychological state. He talks about the suffering of the Arabs in Africa and the suffering of those who marry a Negro, and a child whose mother is a Negro and his father is white.
Some books are not only suitable for reading, but they must take educational curricula taught in all schools of the world, especially the Islamic world .. This book is one of those books ...
very good. . Unfortunately, there is no hot water
Worship and rest ... Near the exit of the hotel from the sanctuary square. Major kitchen appliances and appliances are available .. We hope that there will be private rooms near the hotel car parking for foreign drivers. No breakfast like most hotels. Limited TV stations and channels.
A very interesting narration, but it used to leave me ruined around me, and I read it ... very beautiful.
Wonderful. Close proximity to the mosque and services. Islamic hotel policy. Congestion at reception
If you want to know the state of the Palestinian woman, you must use this narration, then you will surely live in her airspace, moment by moment, laughing sometimes and crying sometimes, to know that life on this earth is a gift and an ordeal .... The novel spoke about Magida&#39;s suffering upon her marriage to Ismael, son of the camp of Jenin, and The intensity of the pain that she felt was from the Jordanians of Palestine, where the bridge, search, torture, humiliation and all forms of torture are there. The events of the novel move us from Magda and Ismail’s marriage to the ignition of the Al-Aqsa Intifada after the criminal Ariel Sharon defiled it and the response of the Palestinian street With calls for resistance and response to the crimes of the occupier, he went out For an entire people, including men and women, old and young, with marches that roamed the entire Palestinian cities, and it was necessary to sacrifice the soul and the money and all that we have, so the martyr rose and many were injured and the houses were destroyed on their residents and the money and properties were confiscated and the people were not left Except God. During the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Magda was in the last months of her pregnancy, and, God willing, she would lose her fetus, Nour, as a result of exposure to a young woman in a university march, and of course she was hiding the news of her pregnancy from her husband, as she was not meeting very much, due to the nature of his work as a nurse and resistance at the same time .. she rolled Days and every day, the siege and restrictions on camp residents are increased in order to search for resistance fighters by the Oslo authority and the Zionist occupation, until the massacre of the Jenin camp took place and many camp residents were martyred, homes were destroyed, and everyone was threatened with death, what was from the people The camp except to flee to their relatives outside the camp, and there Magda met Ishmael and Lall He has to be a mother of two children who are hope and light .. The longing in the hearts of the lovers increases whenever their rows inflame the torments of separation, so was Magda&#39;s case, so her husband now can no longer visit and see his children, he is one of the wanted people for the authority and the occupation army, and if he must From a conversation between the spouses, the messages placed at the grave of their child Nour are the solution, as Ismail sealed it with the number of Zionists who were killed .... Undoubtedly, the husband’s absence left the great void in his family, so Magda decided to join one of the media agencies in order to spread the suffering Prisoners and the people, as soon as Magda became famous and her writings began, the authorities and the occupation began to pledge He was killed or arrested, and she was actually arrested for six months and then deported to Amman. There, she did not remain idle but continued her media work and opened an institution that manages the affairs of Palestinian women .... One morning, the tragic news to her was that her husband was besieged and He was arrested by the occupation forces, to become a hostage to them, days passed and no one met with another, and despair crept for everyone that there is no freedom after today, but God is against the resistance to kidnap an Israeli soldier to become a bargain with the occupation, where the condition of the resistance was to launch He was released in exchange for a prisoner from various organizations, and Ismail was scheduled to be released, as C. When he deported him to Gaza, his family prepared to travel to Gaza to receive her resisting son after a severe absence and a longing, to set foot in the land of Gaza and bless the hands of those who were credited with his release, to embrace the husband and children, the air and the sunlight, and everything in Gaza .. This is how the novel ended with seeing light and hope in the face of God Almighty, and this is what every prisoner in his prison demands, and I ask God Almighty to hasten relief for our leader Abdullah Al-Barghouthi, the owner of this narration, as he is in dire need of light and hope in his life, to complete what remains of Life .
Before going into the details of the novel, I would like to point out that the events mentioned in this novel are not suitable for small age groups, people with weak seals, and those with sensitive equipment ... The novel was named after the Impaler, according to Vlad Dracula, and to the state of Laashia, one of the European provinces that was affected by the Ottoman tidal .. Tasted Foulad Dracula, the bitterness of shame and disgrace, and subjected to the Ottoman tutelage against his will, which made him decide to rebel against Muhammad al-Fatih, the Ottoman governor and take revenge on the Boyars ’group of traders of Saxon origin who ruled in the state of Laashia and revolutionized Father Dracul at the instigation of the King of Hungary and spared no effort in punishing his people and anyone Its relationship in any way with the Puyars or the Turks who were present at the time in Bucharest and Turkiche, the capital of the impaler .. What is noticeable is that the name impaled was not in vain for the son Dracula, but applied with his letters to him .. It was that the foolish monster was penetrating a column whose end was flat on the back of the person, a man who was Or a woman until he settles inside by the amount of two fists and then raises it on a wooden pillar and remains suspended like this until death; that depends on the path the column goes through. Either he reaches his heart or until he comes out from between his eyes .. It was said that those boys were eating his food between the trunks of suspended trees. Individuals had a delight in watching together He accused and their slow death .. The brutality of that crazed did not stop there but rather it was said that he was filling pots of up to five people with water or oil and leaving holes in the mouth to the heads and burning the fire underneath and coming with his old drink and he was afraid to watch the screams of people while they were ripening on the fire .. It was also said that he built A castle for him called Bunary, a distance of a thousand and five hundred degrees from the earth, a ladder dug by the Boyars, who gave them the chance to live by running through the piles .. He tormented a group of Roma whose homelands have children and were ripped and matured of the best of them and ordered the rest to eat their brothers and subject them to him and his rule ... It is said that Vlad Dracula He was killed in his prison in Hungary upon the recommendation of Muhammad Alfa The governor of Al-Othmani after he escaped from Laashia and was betrayed by his brother Radu and followed the Ottoman rule ..... The novel speaks in its entirety about the myth of the return of the spirit of Dracula. Killed in his bathroom and crushed from his neck as if he was a bite of a bite .. He also avenges his killers and the Ottomans .. When the myth of the return of the impaler and spread of fear spread throughout the Ottoman Empire, Muhammad al-Fateh decided to send an envoy to him called Orhan Effendi to refute that myth and transmit the reassurance in the hearts of people .. begins The novel is the journey of Orhan Effendi to Bukhar Six and paradoxes and events continue to become clear in the end that the one who commits crimes in the name of Vlad Dracula&#39;s spirit and has Micah and Michael who decided to avenge their father ... Lessons learned from this novel:. If someone wrongs in the right of someone, apologize to him immediately and before it is too late, because he may leave and you will not be able to apologize to him at all. Do not trust a beautiful woman who seduces you and lures you to your death. You have to suspect the least likely person to commit a heinous crime ... as a poor servant, for example. Trust completely in what reason and logic say, and follow their rules with hidden intelligence, because perhaps logic of despotism becomes one of the most important reasons for reason and general safety. Exposed intelligence inevitably leads to serious consequences. Do not cast your mistakes on the devil, who has no energy except by whispering to you .. For your mistakes are borne by the evil emirate first. Finally, it struck me strongly that all the horrific crimes committed in history against humanity adhered to religious beliefs .. I do not think that religion is absolutely related to inhumanity .. I do not know whether it makes sense for me to send a message to those who use religion as a cover for his brutality that he not only offends himself but also religion ... but I I send a message to people not to believe that any religion is linked to bloodshed ... because the sky is shaking with blood. The novel is really fun despite its miserable end and when you hold it you will not put it before you finish it
very good. . Cleanliness is not at the required level
good. . There is no special breakfast in. The room no. exist. Pass the least thing. Only beads for breakfast
If you have not read the novel yet, then do not see the rural areas until after you read the novel yourself. The novel is divided into three lives, the first is the month of wedding, the second is the shock of the desert, and the third is the mother of the boys. The hero of the novel is slowed down, and the first life says of him: He takes the cup from the trembling hands, and he said in a low voice: Thank you, Aunt. I wished for a moment with a dreamy heart, if it was he who came to address me .. but he was not, he was my brother, my younger sermon than him, who named them the writer, because he writes to them the contracts of trade, and he is called there Nabati even though they are all Nabat, and he who will teach me in a later life, hidden The words of the Arabs and the secrets of touching the meanings with words .. It is from a line called the cover of the novel is the hero, but when we see it only a little. With one double-sided God, and with eternal truth, I say the truth. There is only a son and a mother in the universe, where every mother and son are in them. The son Ishtiaq and the mother bosom. And they have birthing and birth. El-Lat, the essence of all beings and the origin of the hourly images. Inactive in the womb is safe, and all dormant. Do not listen to those who underestimate and rise up, then Han, true to mankind. It is time for my two-sided appearance to come. The Nabati Prophet. With these words the words of the hero started. The events of this novel take place in the seventh century AD, where wars were grinding between the Persians and the Romans, and between the emergence of prophets, including the Prophet Qureshi Muhammad the Messenger of God, and how the Arabs became a military and pivotal power. Egypt, and talks about the Christianity, and there was a slight rescue of Christianity, and after that Maria marries an Arab husband from the Nabataeans ... who are the Nabataeans? They are Arabs who lived in Egypt, Iraq and the Levant by Islam and Christianity. Where did this name come from? The name is more likely to be derived from the distinctive characteristic of this huge ancient group. It is an attribute that distinguished them from the rest of the Arabs, as they were able to extract water from the arid desert. This is the popular opinion, but the fact is that the Nabataeans were skilled in engineering the collection of water that rarely descends with torrents. This narration tells an important time period in the history of Egypt ,,. Including: the ten years of the Persians ’occupation of Egypt and the strong Arab presence in the Levant and Iraq before the emergence of Islam, and like the long Turkines that preceded the coming of Amr bin Al-Aas to take over the affairs of Egypt and many related myths. But the novel presented all of this according to the context of the events, and according to Maria, whose name became Maoist, after she got married to this Nabati merchant .. The first life ends with a marital marriage and the second life begins, which is a journey through the Sinai desert, this life was not very important, but the last life or The boys describe the customs of the Arabs in marriage, describe some events, and describe the era of the many prophets in them, especially the Nabati. The only comment that we hear from the Nabati about Islam was when they brought him a copy of the Qur’an. Himself: brings this, blood coming? Many of the Nabataeans entered Islam, and the Jews and the Nabataeans were expelled except Egypt, to pave the way for the conquest of Egypt ... Nabati remained alone in his home ..., and the end of the tongue was the Coptic Maoism. Do they overlook them, and they are already heedless. So I return to him to stay with him. And together we die. Then we are born again ... these two?
I don’t think you will regret choosing this palace, the hotel is very amazing. The most wonderful hotel in my life, I entered it, the design is very classy, and it deserves the name of a hotel, imposed only by the name of the rose scent everywhere. Employee, the reception is Moroccan, but the soul is full
The imaginative drawing of things and situations .. The description that has no boundaries for beauty ... Wonderful limit of irritation .. Thin limit of infinity ... Parenthood, friendship and loyalty, night, cold and sky, freedom, books and discussion, prison and prison, challenge and determination, parishes, mirror and drawers, ,. A philosophy that combines different classes of language ... embraced the heart and mind, instilled expressions and meanings that I had never seen before.
At first, I felt Nizar, as if he was confiscating Ali. Taking all similes and images from religious models and Islamic words. I loved him what the ages sing. A patient diary is prohibited from writing. And I love you, I love you, and the rest comes ... and I love so hard. A formal denial of a talkative woman. Of course, this start with Nizar, and not the end at all
I really enjoyed the novel, which reflects a refined thought and a mindset
In short more than a biography book
Very good hotel for a little budget. Close to Al-Raqqa Street, which has many restaurants and marketing stores, and also close to Al-Raqqa Station Metro. The small size of the pool
This book is one of the famous books by the intellectual and psychologist Eric From. Eric From, as most people say, is a socialist, but in reality he has critical visions, and he is always critical. He criticized things in capitalism and socialism. In this book, Eric From explains the human being between possessiveness, being, change of speech style indicating gossip and not being after the industrial revolution, and capitalist control and explains the difference between man possessing property, and the person who thinks as an entity. A fascinating book that mixes socialism, capitalism, evolutionary psychology and Freudian psychology
very good . Its location and services. There are not enough elevators for guests
My reading lengths I close my eyes to imagine myself I tell the story of Abraham who I hope will set an example for them in their lives .. I really enjoyed it as if I was a child telling her a bedtime story ..
Exceptional. All services, facilities and staff ... one of the pillows was not clean
As usual, the thought and vision of Mustafa Mahmoud, may God have mercy on him, is very smart, almost the first time that he read widely about Jews
More difficult than you expect.
The great novel deserves to read letter by letter, deserves to walk on every street in it and cross every forest and stare into the eyes of its unforgettable heroes .. the novel of Russia and its sons lost in lost trains, Russia war, love, winter and distant fields .. the novel The Great is not only a fictional epic but also a poetic and human epic that makes you feel sorry if you die before reading it.
There is one thing in which there is no doubt and that is that everything is in doubt
Among the best of what I have read is among the best of what I will read. I will not say of the most beautiful of what I have read, because it was painful lines to the extent of our betrayal to our homeland, the size of our leaders’s negligence, the size of all our disappointments, and the size of our pain since they were found here. It is not a message from a father to his daughter, but from a nation to a nation from a great nation proud father standing for a defeated and defeated nation.
The hotel location is good and new. The location is good. Overrated
Overall a great hotel, the hotel staff is friendly except for the reception staff. The hotel is near the campus, parking is very safe, quiet, cleanliness at the highest level, breakfast in the restaurant is very nice and clean and many options are in it and the staff in the restaurant are very respectful, so I asked to take some fruits to eat in the room with all the literature I said of course, take what you want with you. The suitcase holder is very respectable. I come from the tired travel. Receive me at the door, carry the items onto the vehicle, take the car, park it in the parking spaces, and mount the items and the car key to the door of the room with respect and politeness and the same person when leaving with a practical voice and take the things and arrange them in the car .. After I worked I left the car in the positions and went I walk in the mall, thank them for that. After leaving the hotel, they called me to take my opinion of the hotel service ... The reception was when my wife and I were and he wanted to give me a twin bed room and he insisted, but after talking to him, they told me that you were supposed to make options in a twin bed room room or a king bed He said according to availability And he gave me the King room, as if I was beautified on my head, and gave it to me for free ... And when I called the employee of the hour: She spoke blotting with you for the hour: The maximum amount of time I went out, despite the fact that I was sleeping and tired, I was dismayed at the pain of my things and what the receptionist told me because some hotels give you to me and among them gives you For after the afternoon ... I hope the reception and customer service staff will be friendly and unassuming to the customers only.
His booklet is few and his words are simple, but I liked him because I love the books in which one writes about himself, valid even for young people. His language is clear, direct and without complication.
I highly recommend it to families and individuals. Cleanliness Customer interest Good treatment Location There is a person in the queries called Professor / Thamer Summit in respect and cooperation. nothing
Very good.
This religion and the future of this religion are two valuable books for the martyr Sayyid Qutb, during which he presents focal points dealing with important pillars on which the great Islamic religion is based. Many people have forgotten about it, forgotten by others and ignored others. The most prominent of them in this book is the concept of Islam as a method for human beings and in it the writer shows the nature of Islam’s work in life and how it is on Although it is a divine approach that depends in its mechanism and results on human efforts, it is a dynamic religion that pushes towards work, movement and construction. It urges its followers to take the reasons that motivate them to plow and sow on watering and caring for hardship and effort in order to reap the fruits .. It is the religion of instinct, the religion of logic is God’s law. Here, Mr. says: Some people expect from this religion as long as it is a home from God to work in the lives of people in a magical supernatural mysterious reasons and without any consideration for the nature of humans and their innate energies and their material reality at any stage of their development and in any environment of their environment. . He adds: This divine approach, which Islam represents in its final form, as stated by Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, is not achieved in the earth and in the world of people. Once it comes down from God, it is not achieved by a word. Be divine directly the moment you download it. And it is not achieved by simply communicating it to people and clarifying it, nor by divine oppression in the manner that its law passes through the course of astronomy and the functioning of the planets .. Rather it is achieved by carrying a group of people who fully believe in it and uphold it according to its energy and strive to achieve it in the hearts of others and in their lives as well and strive to this end with all that Owns. . It also shows the effect of that human effort on life and the soul, and he says: It is evident that leaving the divine approach to human endeavor to achieve it within the limits of human energy is good for human souls and good for human life .. We say this not to explain the will of God Almighty in making an order about what He has made but let us record only a realistic observation of the effects of this will in the lives of worshipers. . Then the writer moves to other aspects of the topic to present concepts and other characteristics of that approach, such as uniqueness, facilitation and influence, indicating each of them separately. Then he concludes with several Islamic principles and concepts that, in his opinion, caused a radical change in the concepts of nations and peoples, and it was a revolution in the full sense of the word that went beyond the borders of Muslim societies to spread all mankind and paint civilizations with their unique ideas. Which:. One humanity: liberation for the first time from the concept of national nationalism, ethnic, tribal, color, sexual, etc., and the trend towards human unity .. Almighty says: O people, we created you from a male and a female and made you people and tribes to know that if I honor you with God, I fear you, God is knowing an expert. . Great truth of God. . Generous humanity: Islam made human dignity derived from its own humanity, not from any other offer such as gender, color, class, wealth ..... etc .. The Almighty said :. We have honored the children of Adam, carried them on land and sea, provided them with good things, and preferred them over many of those who created us a preference. And when we said to the angels, bow down to Adam, and worship only Satan, my father, and he was proud, and he was one of the disbelievers. .... Great truth of God. . One Nation: Making Islam from a faith is a supporter of gathering, because belief is the most generous characteristic of the human spirit. The Almighty said: This is your nation, one nation, and I am your Lord. . Edema and creation: Islam established the foundations of morality in society and established systems and legislated for it and made it a basis in all dealings and made it a philosophy and etiquette even in times of wars and battles .. The Almighty says: And fulfill the covenant of God if you pledge and do not deny faith after its affirmation and you have made God a guarantor for you if God knows what you are doing and you will not be the same as the one whose void has been revoked after the power of Ankatha. You take your faith as an income between you. To be a nation that is more of a nation than God. . Here are some beautiful quotes from wonderful passages mentioned in the book: Human instinct in its origin is consistent with the law of the universe .. When a person departs with his life system from that law, he not only collides with the vast universe, but also collides with his instinct that is between his sides, and he suffers, is torn, confused, anxious, and lives as humanity lives today in the torment of unhappiness despite all the scientific victories. And all material cultural facilities. . It is not true, starting with the fact that this divine approach costs the human psyche a more difficult effort than to tolerate it or to become long on it .. It is a truly noble approach, but at the same time it is an innate approach that relies on the balance of instinct and spends this balance. And its advantage is that he knows his way from the first moment to this balance. He knows his way to the human soul from the first touch. He knows her paths and curves, and he gently tramples her; he knows her entrances and exits, and he walks up to her in an upright manner and knows her powers and capabilities, so she never surpasses her; she knows her needs and aspirations, and she meets them completely; When Islam first confronted mankind, it faced this reality with the balance of instinct alone. The balance of instinct was with this debt; despite the long generations that passed and it accumulated over the ruins of the broad pre-Islamic reality .. But the instinct of instinct was stronger than all of this aggregate; and the response of instinct was sufficient to shake that aggregate. . God has imposed jihad on believers not to hate people to convert to Islam but to establish on the earth his just, upright and just order that people choose their faith that they love under this system that includes both Muslim and non-Muslims in complete justice. The Almighty says: There is no compulsion in religion, adulthood has emerged from the abolition.
Sudden events and mystery that may inspire you. For reading history books, it is very interesting. This novel could not resist its completion. Really, it is a novel from a sophisticated and reliable standard by this author. The novel talks about mysterious events. He spoke to Naim Al-Wazzan in Morocco after the suicide of history professor Abdelkader and finds that his suicide was not a suicide. Above and beyond what he expected, behind his death, a Masonic community suspicious of it, and events dating back to you during the fall of the Ottoman Empire. In fact, the fall of which was not of the reasons we read about in history, there are reasons and hidden hands. Oh God, how this novel deserves dozens, but the sky of the stars
Rita before and after reading my secrets. My outlook changed her degree. Behind the strong character there. His child is afraid, romantic and tired psychologically:. I loved the book a lot and benefited from some of its experiences
Overall excellent. everything. Wi-Fi
Wow .. Dr. Mundhir Al-Qabbani, any creativity, this is a novel that exceeded expectations, I really enjoyed every part of it and lived it I wished it had not ended..I am glad that I enjoyed reading it
Despite my academic studies of translation, I benefited a lot from this book and one reading for it is not enough
From what I read the coolest...
This book examines the underdevelopment resulting from the emergence of the phenomenon of the newly independent countries, which is called the third world .. It is known that there are many previous studies and studies on underdevelopment, but these studies have taken economic, industrial and sometimes social perspectives without examining the study of the underdeveloped human condition .. This book is so A type of entrance to the psychology of underdevelopment, which is an attempt based on observation and psychological and social analysis of the phenomena experienced by the oppressed person, an attempt that is not intended to reach final results but rather to contribute to the results that complement the social and economic studies of this phenomenon .. The human being of these societies was not seen as an essential element in any study whatsoever, so the author intended to put things in their proper framework by studying this category and analyzing its properties and knowing its structure and dynamism .. This book is a study of the psychology of the underdeveloped person, as the psychology of underdevelopment in human terms is the same psychological The oppressed human being is under the rule of oppression imposed on him who holds the reins of power .. The writer also worked on overcoming the superficiality that overshadowed the studies of development scholars on the reality of underdevelopment and tried to prove that the underdeveloped person stands as an obstacle in the face of changing the backward social structure due to the suspicion Tahama with his psychological structure .. The writer started the first section of the book with the psychological features of the underdeveloped presence by identifying and defining the backwardness and put forward the theories of backwardness represented by the superficial method in the study of backwardness and a social and other economic method that attributes the cause of backwardness to industrial and technical backwardness and structural economic backwardness and then presents the psychological perspective of backwardness and psychological characteristics of him and the most important These characteristics are oppression where a person goes through three stages: The stage of oppression and submission resulting from the complexes of deficiency, shame and disorder of permanence. The stage of persecution. The stage of rebellion and confrontation. After studying these characteristics, it is necessary to study the retarded mentality and its systematic mental characteristics, which suffer from the disorder of methodology of thinking and the limitations of dialectical reasoning. The writer attributed the mental retardation to two factors: education policy, mental retardation, relations of domination, subjugation, and mental retardation ... The author ends this section by studying the unconscious life of the oppressed person Its unconscious dynamics, that is, the hidden and driving factors of underdevelopment: The relationship of authoritarianism and subjugation of cataract and resulting in anxiety of the castration. Nature impinges on the image of the bad mother and leads to anxiety of abandonment. And underneath these coats of human being subjugated, defensive methods must be used in an unsuccessful attempt to get rid of the injustice situation. This is what the author presented in the second section, where he spoke about the four most important defensive methods, namely: Self-sufficiency. Either by sticking to the past and returning to the glorious past. Or thawing in the group and returning to the clan family, as he finds refuge in him from some of his responsibilities. Or even relying on others. Identification by the ruler. Identification by authoritarian identification with identification of his flesh, aggression, values and lifestyle. Superstitious control of destiny. There are two types of this control. Either control the present, for example the awliya, their shrines and their dignity, the jinn, the orcs and the devil, the hostile relationships, the envy and the magic. Where the oppressed person attributes what he is exposed to in his life for one of these reasons. Or the second type of control, which is controlling the future, such as flying, dream interpretation, fortune-telling and divination. Where his fate is related to one of these aspects. Or to attribute his status and backwardness, and anything that was destined to be delivered to him. Violence. Some manifestations of violence: Masked violence. The aggression, whether self-defeating or outward-oriented. Symbolic violence. Like delinquent behavior. Existential tension and persecutory relations. Among the psychological theories that explained aggression and violence: A view of animal psychology. A psychoanalytic view. Phenomenological point of view. Finally, it is necessary to talk about the position of women in the underdeveloped society, which has the largest share of oppression and marginalization. The writer has drawn features of the oppression that women live in the industrious and under-industrious milieu, in the middle class and in the privileged group. One of the oppressions experienced by women is deficiency and reduction. And the looting is either economic, sexual or ideological and is the most dangerous. Among the defensive methods women use against oppression are narcissistic inflation and indirect control over men.
very good. Its proximity to the Prophet&#39;s Mosque.
Susan Eliwan Although it was my first time with her, Susan brought the rest of me / she struck my last blow
Interesting . The hotel was very beautiful, excellent services, and a great breakfast. I didn&#39;t like having annoying guests near my room so I couldn&#39;t sleep until late due to the inconvenience, screams, etc.
If you were an Arab leader, you would not have agreed to any agreement with Israel, then this is normal. We took their country, yes, God promised us this land, but this matter does not concern them .. Because our God is not their God, and this happened two thousand years ago, so what calls them to give him attention? They see only one thing that we came and stole their country, so why should they accept this? David Ben-Gurion. I was hoping that I would find a happy ending, but a realistic end to the extreme. I liked the gift, the dove, the pilgrim Mahmoud and Khaled al-Haj Mahmoud .. Yasmin and Sumaya. Al-Anisa, Al-Azizia, Khadra and Fatima Salem and Naji. Like you liked Palestine .. I hated the Arabs, I hated their cheese, their selfishness, and their fraud. A wonderful novel .. and a realistic ending
I loved pure love and hated that community we live in, a society that deprives all lovers of association, and that is under the name that it is not permissible for an entire man to be an imperfect woman ... but also I hated the thinking of the eastern man and how he left that poor thing and went to another without showing his feelings Any interest .. This is how we are. The eastern society, an incomplete man, plays with this and that, and in return does not accept anything but a pure woman who has not touched before. So what do you realize that perhaps this lover is better than your wife?
Happy vacation in Dammam. I liked the location, the service, the comfort and the way of dealing. There is no
Reading is another life granted to man. I always hear this phrase This book made me sure that the above statement is correct. Despite the large book size, I did not feel bored and read it again. From books that open life. Thanks to those who gave me this book:
A wonderful series that represents the dream of every voracious reader. To live the adventures that he reads about and to meet. The heroes of novels and books that he read. From childhood until now. Thank you, Dr. Khaled Tawfik, for this wonderful series
Comfortable stay and family friendly place. The staff are helpful and respectful and the price is very suitable and the location is very good close to the city facilities, the apartment is clean and its area is very reasonable and the kitchen suits the needs of the family .. Unfortunately there is only one car park for each apartment even if it is a large apartment ..
Soha Hotel. The location is very excellent, all services are below you, the sea, five-star hotels and cafes, and Jumeirah Beach is enough for you. Log in bags with you, necessary from the bed room
good. . Online bar volume, pool time
More than a wonderful, very coherent, dramatic story, I loved it from the beginning until the end, after a bad novel, Nicrophilia, the least for me.
What is the use of literary works if they are not discussed and try to address humanitarian issues? The narration of Saq Al-Babbambo is a literary work that is tight and fun in terms of context and narration of details struck at the heart of the humanitarian issues of Arab society in general and Kuwaiti in particular. The novel discusses the case of blind intolerance to Arab societies .. I started reading this novel during the end of semester tests for a year and I could not stop reading from the beauty of the events and details of the novel, therefore, unfortunately, it had a negative impact on the results of my studies .. Advice; to listen to the novel try to devote itself For her, the novel takes you to another world from the dark reality of poor Philippine societies and the constant hypocrisy of Arab societies in its various forms.
An impressive book for anyone who wants to see his journey after death, how ... frankly, is one of the most beautiful books ... I mean, the picture and the method of style, they attract one to him ..
Exceptional. The rooms are connected to Wi-Fi than they were the previous year.
A series of white snow stories in succession, I traced the effect of Al-Makhzangi&#39;s steps on the snow to the last page in a continuous reading without interruption .. Adept Muhammad Al-Makhznji in describing and expressing, cruel in his analogies like the harsh snow, and Hadi as the calm of the night between his lines. How cold I felt when reading, did I not say that he was really adept. I added some of my favorite quotes on travel
One of the sweetest short stories that I actually read .. I am not a fan of short stories, by the way, but it really stressed me ... The style is very fine ... More than two stories, they hung with me, they were Haj Abbas and slept to see him ... I was glad that I read this collection of stories diligently:
One of the best books
One of the most wonderful things to be told ..... a female story of the first degree ... an eastern female story ... in my country. It was difficult for me to miss without making it happen. In the same scenes, the beginning and the end ... beginning from the most wonderful thing ... and the end is well deserved ...
I cried, I am still crying, and I will remain ... It is not only a novel, but a painful reality and bitter truth. A story that touched the deepest point in my heart, and it will accompany me to its effect as long as it is beautiful, crying, my mother. For a person to live this long period, to be crushed to death only with a bulldozer; is this what it means to be a Palestinian?
Enjoyable trip . Clarity in material handling and excellent service in cleanliness. nothing
The hotel is very cool. Location service cleanliness. There is no
Excellent . Every second time, I booked a studio and promoted an upgrade. Thank God for the blessing, but I do not eat, I do not eat a professional hotel chef
Exceptional. Everything the reception staff are excellent. Channels are limited. The jacuzzi is cold
A funny and light book .. The writer tells about Austria in his funny and sarcastic style, as he spent a period of his life there ... providing you with a lot of information about Austria, especially Vienna in terms of people, streets, restaurants, etc. from the famous places there
All Ramadan and Ramadan really Ramadan, my friend:.
very good . Location and size of the rooms. The inconvenience of the hotel
As far as the beauty of the novel is concerned, the last chapter feels as if it is another writer and another style .. Accelerated events in it spoil a part of its aesthetic, but in total they do justice to the close narrations of the heart
A wonderful biography of Marie Curie and the entire scientific biography. The translation is excellent, as if the book was written in Arabic mainly.
very good. The price is very very appropriate.
Hotel with great standard. Excellent and distinctive hotel, close to services, rapid response of the crew,. The hotel does not have private parking .. but it is not a problem
I finished a book of stories Farghali Al-Mstkawi My Story with Kafr Al-Sahlawiyah by Hassan Al-Jundi. It is a very horror book. Comedy horror type. To be honest, I was very relaxed, and I advise everyone about his decisions, especially the first story with my story with my dear one. The first time I read Hassan al-Jundi and it will not be the last.
The book&#39;s author, Abd al-Rahman Munif, was born in Amman to a family from Najd, central Saudi Arabia, and studied in Amman, Baghdad and Cairo. He worked in the field of oil in Syria for a year where he moved after that to work in the press in Beirut with Balagh magazine and moved in late to France full-time constituting a full writing of the novel so the salt cities with their first parts were among the most important of his products, which is a novel that was translated into several languages, including English, German and Norwegian .. The novel Cruel, agonizing and terrifying embodying the bitter reality that one encounters in the Arab world with just a political opinion that may be aimed at changing or objecting to an unemployed regime, but in light of restricting the freedoms incarcerated, the fate was .. The work is listed by several parties equally between the main character Rajab, the prisoner of opinion and Anissa Naughty This major novel dealt with the issue of prisoners of conscience and what happens inside the corridors of prisons, as the torturers like to call torture. Rajab is a persistent revolutionary figure. Therefore, he did not advocate absolute freedom, if freedom was his only goal, he would not risk his life .. when he carried all these kinds of torture. Silently ... a long silence for nothing but to overcome the executioners. Silence was the only way to get away from them and to win the war that he led against them and against injustice, tyranny and oppression, but he eventually fell. He could not resist any more, even if he wanted to because of his illness, his body failed him and finally after he struggled Long for one cause, which is to raise a voice Stalking and nullifying falsehood and limiting the lives that are constantly lost in the corridors of dark prisons, where the false force is exercised, taking advantage of power and influence. Rajab asked: Is it possible to repair the will of a person whom I no longer associate with life in connection .. I am that person, no, I am not a human being, the prison in his early days tried to kill my body. I did not imagine that I endured everything they did but I endured it was only my will that receives the blows and turns back angry looks and silence. I was misled as well. I was not intimidated, I did not retreat: cold water, let it be, hang for seven days, let it be the death threat and bullets scattered around it so it was my will that resisted. The novel is coherent and interesting. The narration of events brought an interesting image with which it is difficult to stop except when it is finished. The plot is also elaborate and the language is beautiful and thin. I partially liked Rajab’s soliloquy to the ship, the deep dialogues and the strength of the determination that the protagonist displayed despite all the difficulties he experienced from torture including Beating and verbal abuse and all kinds of insult and injustice.
Fine hotel. Hygiene price, online design services. Location only
A wonderful novel in the full meaning of the words .... When I arrived at the last phrase of it I did not have before my exclamation except to clap and shout at the loudest voice. . How wonderful Jose / Jesus / Jose ... that belongs to more than one homeland, more than one religion, and has more than one name .... I found myself standing like a dazzling person in front of his strange personality that brought together contradictions ... He is Jose / Joseph / Jose / Jesus ... He is a Christian, a Buddhist .... and a Muslim. He is a Filipino and Kuwaiti .... In the Philippines they were calling him. . When he went to Kuwait, they became calling him Filipino. This story is very wonderful ... a story of belonging and roots ... a story of being lost and lost in more than one country, more than one religion ... and more than one name. The story of the bamboo leg, which once cut off part of its leg until it grows in a new land ... with no past ... and no memory ..... You cannot indulge in the novel without smelling between the lines the smell of mangoes ... and the fragrance of dust dotted with tropical rain .... When you read it you must live the Filipino climate ... You must fill your lungs with the smoke of Manila ... You must feel the green faint Your eyes ... are blue .... The novel is truly wonderful ... very humane ... very realistic ... it makes you believe that whoever writes is Jose, and that whoever translates is Ibrahim Salama, and that whoever checks and retracts is authorization, the game of margins, gifting, and the introduction of the translator ... all this It makes you live the story as it is. A novel worth reading. ...
Don&#39;t miss Damac. The scenery, the stay, and the service are amazing, and I thank the Mistress forbid her very classy treatment. Positions
Wonderful, and we have another visit. The location and serviced parking. Bags service does not exist and the TV channels are very limited. Bathroom and ironing systems are not available
Excellent. The room is beautiful and spacious, bathroom and shower are massive, breakfast is excellent. The color of the curtain is not in keeping with the decor, there is no good view of the hotel
At first I did it. / Leayeyer stayed. Because the novel was never beginning, it means all publishers and needs, and no one will complete it. But the writer was able to completely flip the course of the novel in a different style, and his way was to draw me from his page to his page. The first time I read something about Sufism, I found it very possessive and decided to read the forty rules of love. The novel is a valuable value that deserves publication. The writer&#39;s style is based on a large culture, and it is continental, in many different subjects. The narration and classical Arabic are very attractive, regardless of some words that were colloquial in the midst of speech
good. Proximity to the campus and services. Breakfast does not have free parking
I think that this book is necessary to study and test those who are about to marry before the contract:. A very beautiful book that touches reality. The length of what I read, and I come to my mind about events that took place and I say actually the same as what happens:. His style is so repetitive that the full hours I sentence I read:. But in general, it is great
I read it within the complete works of Manfalouti. A wonderful book. Articles that address community issues in a sophisticated literary style. Exquisite art formulation. .. congratulations to its holders
Meridian is the best. Transportation to and from the campus for an hour, the cleanliness of the bathrooms. Breakfast buffet. Thanks to the managers of this hotel. I will repeat the landing in it, God willing .. Frankly, there is no internet and we hope that the hotel management will reconsider the internet security. Because it is for a riyal to get the internet for one day, only a large amount. While the customer can buy a data chip at a much cheaper price.
A wonderful book you will not be able to leave unless you have finished it. I stayed up until dawn to complete his reading
A very beautiful day is worth returning. I liked the privacy and the responsiveness of the workers, thanks a lot. We were also bothered by the presence of many insects
No wonder that this full-fledged masterpiece wins poker, the writer excelled in it on all levels. Smoothness of the story line .. The connection between personalities and events .. And many many human values are buried here and there among the folds of the book. He accompanies you on a journey floating around with different feelings .. between anger and contentment .. between laughter and crying .. and sometimes even bereavement. Confused about speeding up to keep pace with events or slowing down so long to enjoy. It touches on many contradictions .. our hateful racism .. our unjust class ... our pure materialism ... our social hypocrisy ... our false condemnation ... and our complying with the unfair restrictions of society that God has brought down from authority. However, he was not satisfied with criticism only, but also praised some of the prevailing positive values, such as coexistence among a group of crazies ... friendship ... and the spread of peace between people, for example. In more than one personality, the writer raises the idea that evil is not rooted in the human soul, but it is an urgent matter .. It is the result of harsh conditions and suffering .. hardening the heart and obscuring his mercy, perhaps an invitation not to rush to judge others .. despite the fact that the novel is a special case for a Filipino / Kuwaiti Tah Between two countries .. except that all expatriate workers can be compared to them .. the next time you see a foreign worker .. remember that he has a humble house in the land of Mendoza of his own .. and has a family .. Josephine, Adrian, Alberto, Mama Aida and Merla ..Takes a bitterness for the stranger to support them. In the end, she leaves a manic world with questions: What is the homeland? What makes you belong to him? What is affiliation? Is an official document sufficient to be a citizen? Is happiness really what we wish for? Sure, everything happens because of, and for a reason. I liked ... the novel’s vaccination of realism .. when it was linked to real events and personalities that he referred to in the margin. The writer&#39;s modesty, indecency, and his distance from obscenity when dealing with sensitive issues, such as the meeting of Rashid and Josephine. It was not read or wasted on linguistic structures and pictures .. It used from time to time to give a distinct flavor to the text. I advise everyone who thinks about reading it to acquire it and start it immediately .. it did not regret
Wonderful extent of pain, lines of pain as if they were bullets :. God put him in the balance of your good deeds ... O God, a near and healing relief for the issuance of believers
I think of a day when I concluded it was a riot and a fire struck at the dome bridge where I live: I preferred hearing the sound of hitting the fire and people running in the street, and I am in the state of consciousness. Is he rich and dreaming that I am poor and not poor and dreaming that I am rich? Dr. Ahmed has concluded with you all the words:
Plant the sword on the front of the desert, until no-nonsense is answered .. Do not reconcile and do not share with those who killed you food and water your heart with blood .. : The stars .. for its chronographs and birds .. for its sounds and sand .. for its atoms and the slain for its looking girl everything crashes in a passing moment Above the fierce duel, everything was destroyed in a whimsy whim and who assassinated me: not usury .. to kill His will is not the noblest of me .. to kill me ..biskanth is not the most skillful of me .. to kill me Bastdarth cunning. Do not reconcile and if you stand against your sword all the elders and men that are filled with cracks, those whose turbans hang over their eyes and their Arab swords have forgotten the years of glory are not reconciled.
A wonderful book that describes well the changes that occurred in Egyptian society from a modern man. This change, moment by moment .. The book will change your view of many things and actions in the lives of Egyptians.
The unit was like this. To suddenly find yourself in the world as if you had just finished coming. From another planet you do not know why you were kicked out ... . Elena suffers from a unit she has imposed on her or herself. She does not matter. Her life without friends, and all around her. Her husband, brother, sister, and daughter, and their mother accepted them. They play secondary roles in the theater of her life .... boredom and emptiness stain all her actions. What were the reports of the investigation office, hanging around in the streets without aim, drinking wrapped cigarettes stuffed with hashish, and writing a diary about her life. Except as a result of weariness, loneliness, and emptiness that Elena suffered from them .. Unlike loneliness, we are faced with another fact. It is a person’s fear that he will resemble a person who hates his transformation with days into that person with the same character, emotions, unity, and sometimes cruelty. Elena resembles her mother in everything ... to the point where she is not finished. From reading her mother’s diaries she began writing her own diaries, and she started that at the same age as her mother started writing her diaries ... as if what she is trying to escape from is an object inside her .. she is a reflection of her mother’s image in the woman .. What she was criticizing about her .. She was doing in return .. Especially her relationship with her daughter Mercedes ... I liked the end .. So, Elena re-arranged her life again. She decided to transform her unit into reality .. She preferred to be truly alone rather than live among people who did not feel it.
good. . Maintenance in the room that I have bitter, I didn’t know back people. I sat in the hotel for days and the same inconvenience in maintenance.
I always liked the doctor in his writings. Wonderful and powerful arguments. .. I feel as if an atheist of the stone age, because most of his questions have become in the age of culture that anyone can answer not all of them. A special book, I advise everyone to read Muslim and Atheist:
As if it is an analytical book, for the world around Ezzat, before it and in its present .... between a long paragraph to a short sentence .. analyzes, and gives an idea that may be new .. compares and parallels between sect / group / party / group .... and another .. The book contains many of the information that I classified as a general culture that I had never known. And many of the analyzes that put me in front of a dilemma ... made me think about it, with a new eye. As if with his analyzes and exposures, he put my mind on the final line of the ideas and beliefs that dominate the world today and yesterday ... that is, the bottom line. . From the point of view of truth, there are two things that are clear: The right stops when it turns into a force. The right stops when it is reduced to an abstract legal idea. A man and a woman become a married couple, not as they are similar, but rather as they are different .. There are people who live only biologically, and they are emotionally and psychologically dead. To be alive is, above all, to be spiritually alive .. Optimism sometimes seems ridiculous .. What we are ... It is we, and not the one that we believe, or we wish to be .. By rejecting the world cannot be triumphed, that is not possible Only with acceptance. In fact, the acceptance of the world is a condition for it to change and win .. One of the stated goals of the movement for the defense of women&#39;s rights is the struggle against the glorification of motherhood. I do not want democratization .. I want democracy.
The articles will make you think about every need differently after reading it
For the first time I read a terrifying novel I admit that I closed my eyes at times. | A novel that blends fantasy with reality in a beautiful and interesting way The idea of the historical novel I liked greatly There are some phrases I didn&#39;t like, but this is a horror novel at the end The conclusion may not have convinced me even though it made the novel so terrifying I wished that the author had changed the novel&#39;s name to Ibn Al-Shaitan, for example .. Despite everything the narrator really deserves reading
I read the beginning of the story of the story of love ... so it was not difficult to keep up with the events in this novel ... It is very beautiful from the writer that he wrote this novel ... It is very nice for me to leave space for Rawda to tell about her feelings as he left a space of Before to Yaqoub, may God have mercy on Ghazi Al-Qossabi
I admit that I am very passionate about prison literature, but it was not my passion that completely drowned me in the sea of the words of this novel, but rather its smooth transition between events and the durability of its weaving of detail and its ability to extract feelings of sadness and joy from within you on one page and without even flipping it. The novel will take you to the year AD, when he carried the feeling of responsibility and a sense of nationalism, the protagonist of the real novel, Samir Al-Kuntar, who was not yet seventeen years old, to join one of the Palestinian liberation movements on the territory of his country, Lebanon, those movements that believed that extracting land from the occupier would not be through negotiations and organizations Rights, but through a gun, and through a very daring process, during which Samir and his group infiltrated the occupied land of Palestine, Israel, with the aim of capturing a number of Zionists to pressure the Zionist regime to achieve a set of achievements, including the liberation of Arab prisoners in the occupation prisons, changed the course of his life, where he was injured and arrested A colleague cited the rest of the group .. you&#39;ll find yourself immersed in the details of the life of a man he spent behind bars for a period of thirty years to connect to the year of liberation, where Samir rule despite a fabulous amount of the year. These words will tell you about the painful meaning of captivity, and they will describe the sweetness of dignity to you, even if you are in the grip of the enemy, who works hard to break your will, your dignity, your resolve and your identity. The novel will take you away from your reality, to find yourself alive in the solitary cells, and sometimes in the courtyard of the prison, you will find yourself in the depth of Palestinian liberation groups and among the Arab detainees living their pain and the meekness of some of them, even as if you hate yourself at the time, you will hear the voice of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, may God have mercy on him, emanating from among its words And you will get acquainted closely with many of the names that I have always heard mentioning in the news broadcasts such as Marwan Al-Barghouti and my soul is coveted and many many of them .. Although the novel will plunge you into the details of life inside the prison and will give you a glimpse of the attempts to break the bone and restore consideration between the thick prison and the prisoner of pride, but you will not Radiate Never bored ... feeling that Seetmlkk is feeling distressed ... how excited turns the heroes do not take them in their struggle to blame gun holders and naval battles Khaida to wrench holders and Khaida empty intestine battles. And how does the harsh life and unjust force unconcerned with humanity compel that Mujahid from his ceiling demand expelling the occupation from Arab land to the owner of a demand to improve the quality of food and increase the hours of going out to the courtyard and raising the glass barrier between him and his family? A very cruel formula ... lived by Samir Al-Quntar and whoever preceded him and those who followed him in the prisons of the occupation ... a cruel equation lived by detainees of conscience, dignity and freedom in the camps of injustice, brutality and injustice everywhere .. even here near us. But the most that will confuse you in this novel is the symphony of patience and hope that Qantar and his colleagues played in prison for all these years, who are satisfied, contemplating, hoping, that hope, which is carried by Israeli prisons, to complete his university studies, even though his rule is five life sentences.
Exceptional. Underground parking and reception staff. The cafe in the lobby needs improvement
The more I read to him, the more calm and quiet he became. The genius of a few words on him, may God have mercy on him. May God have mercy on him. Bahr Alam is not satisfied
A book more than wonderful ... excerpts from the book ... tell me what you think less than you are .. are you busy collecting money and owning real estate and stockpiling stocks and bonds? Or is it busy climbing positions, gathering authorities, and moving in a procession of servants, crowds, and secretaries? Or that all of your concerns are the harem and the tables of the pleasures and the same senses and all your goal is that you have the power and the power and the wealth and the delights ... If this is your concern you are owned and servant .. ............. ......... It is owned by your desires and desires, and is a slave to your desires that are endless. The happiness of its habitat is the heart, not the pocket, and there is no lesson in it by increasing the material possibilities. Happiness stems from the conscience. And from a person’s relationship with himself and his relationship with God, which is at the root of a religious feeling and not a physical feeling .. It stems from a person’s sense that he is not alone and that God is with him, and that caring takes care of him and good inspiration helps him, and that he does all his duties .. ... To the truth of what is whispering in the heart of a woman a inch away from you .. Rather, our minds adorn us even our emotions themselves, so we think that the love of glory drives us and the fact that it is vanity and self-love .. And we think that justice is the T leads us to cruelty, while what drives us is envy and hatred.
You must know the history of this enemy and how he built this civilization on the bodies of innocent people and still is
As if the difference in age is that we stop breathing in falsehoods and opening a new window for the winds of change.
Despotism and life under observation, the freedom to hijack moments from the small details of life, letters, writing, pen and letters of the leader, irony hidden behind ideas and words hidden from eyes, grandmother&#39;s fear and grudge boldness, religion and society, history and Iraq, war and the status of recruitment and preparation, details dispatched here and there for a stage of The history of Mesopotamia ,, the novel is good and carries a beautiful depth
The place deserves praise and repetition. The location is beautiful and the service is also great. Prices for restaurant and indoor coffee are high ... Wi-Fi is not good
Every one of us needs to read or hear a tape. Very necessary, by God
Noon is a good and comfortable place to stay. Everything is neat and clean, the kitchen is very clean, the staff are excellent and helpful and the location is close to the metro and valet. The pool is not up to the required standard and is not well serviced and there are no chairs available. Please pay more attention to it
Bahaa Taher flies me to his different skies, with his most profound and simple characters. I adore him when he describes sometimes, and when he dives deeper into the seas of his characters again. Really creative
This book is one of the most wonderful books I have read in my life
The ultimate in luxury and comfort. The room is luxurious and very clean, the bed is comfortable, easy access to the hotel from the campus, and breakfast was royal. Difficult to reach the hotel by car due to heavy traffic
Yreka is best stay in Dubai. The housekeeping service and the location are close to all services.
It is a struggle of wills. The will of the occupier, with his cruelty, brutality, war machines and unlimited possibilities And the will of the Mujahid with his simple capabilities ..
It really was a king of beam. Like a clear ray of light, I come upon the great land of Thebes. He calls for the worship of one God at a time when Egypt only knew the multiplicity of gods, so whenever they found something in it they were a source of strength and inspiration from God without God until the Egyptian religion became one of the most ancient religions. It is controlled by the most insidious men and priests. So he came strangely in shape and turned, and with the heart of a strange child on a strange land carrying in his heart the knowledge of a prophet and faith of Abd Saleh, calling on his people to worship one God and reject the idols that are of no use or harm. He lived fighting hatred with love and disbelief in faith and war in peace. He died burdened with his illness, worries and self-purity. A stranger died as a stranger came .. He is Akhenaten, the greatest king of the Pharaohs and the owner of the strangest history over Egypt. As for the writer ... From where do I have words that fulfill the truth of the magnificence of what I read The sweetest language and the most beautiful words. Adel Kamel is the owner of an exquisite pen and an elegant language that does not match her beauty, and her competitor can only compete with Naguib Mahfouz&#39;s pen. A novel that brought everything beautiful and dazzling in the world of literature. From harmonic narration, smart vocabulary, and impressive profiles. Building characters that only a professional and experienced writer can master. The most beautiful thing yet. My knowledge is completely fair. And read a king from a beam ..
Exceptional. . They prepare and leave
If you were in a text, you would have made it ... but it deserves the frankness remains wonderful .. despite the fact that the details and the prosthesis in it, I will see it Zayed about the necessity, but his age was not always boring interesting and his style is wonderful .. the only disadvantage in my view is that it is like a total of a great story .. I mean, can be summarized Simply, two pages, exactly ... the concept of many events, and the details are not long and local .. But:
The place is excellent for the family. Excellent location and cleanliness of the apartments. Wi-Fi is weak and sometimes it turns off
Very convenient and quiet. Everything.
A very sweet book, a new idea, and a masterpiece style.
I will not consider this book as short stories, but rather a purely philosophical book. I loved Tawfiq Al-Hakim in the story of the martyr, as he asks the question: What if Satan wants to repent and follow one of the three monotheistic religions? This is a question I fell in love with. Maybe Tawfiq answered his way, but this question is still in my mind .. As for the story of the birth of an idea, it is a dialogue between the idea and the thinker .. A beautiful and surprising dialogue, although fragile, but it is very deep. There are many stories with a deeper philosophical meaning than they seem to be, and they were asked questions that we would not have thought of. The book has four stars and the last star has gone because some of the stories were not that beautiful
Boudl Hotel Apartments. Comforts. nothing
A book that changed my life
Excellent . The reception is for people, Ahmed and Muhammad, and two workshops are for cleaning money.
And some books awaken a thousand feelings and feelings in us, we wonder where we were from them and oh no great loss if we had read them and we were lucky because this did not happen. . Such books transcend our misfortune, after which it is difficult for us to read any book that does not match its magnificence, as if it were trying to reach us to the ceiling of our literary sufficiency .. .. and that the line from it to thunder in his newspaper of rage, and that the word to weep cries to see, and that the letter is moaning He hears that his whole history is rising up because he is a royal calamity depicted in a king. . .. .. I very much read this book, prepared the pages and pondered the lines for hours. Whenever I drank more than a certain fresh Rafi’i, I feel thirsty for more .. I ended it and to quote my thirst immediately I dealt with the leaves of the rose that is a complement to it and there I found his lover saying:. ..Not let this pen that I have given you congratulate you, because what you have written with it will always remain on the horizons of this language a revelation cloud bearing download it .. And God is the one who savors the taste of this sweetness in which your ingenuity drips, so that after him he remains in a constant hunger to it like the hunger of the rich for gold. . .. This was my current tongue at the time, with Al-Rafii, the master of the pen, words and language. . We leave the substance to matter, the hatred and hatred are broken in them, and the soul saves the soul as a light in the east that emits a light in Morocco, and if a star turns away from a star, both of them can glimpse to the other a smiling glimpse from afar, making the dimension a clear ray even if it is in the same Itself a flame from a hell lit up. . ....Here is neither platitude nor vice ... here is a mental love in which the soul is sublimated from matter, and it flows in a letter to him on the soul, magic falls, an authentic poisonous letter, which elevates our tastes and thoughts.
Excellent . everything. Morning breakfast queue
It is a fun intellectual book. He was like a friend who pulled my hand, and reassured me all the time that I was not walking in the wrong way =,. And the book in a nutshell: It is not made by a thinker. But as d. Bakkar: The thinker is formed automatically and unintendedly. It just teaches you some thinking strategies, and some ways that thinkers have to do ... Thank you, my friend. Thank you very much. Abdul Karim Bakkar.
The book spoke about the soul and what happens to it after the death of a person, and its headquarters are until the resurrection, and several topics related to her sense of who is visiting the grave, and her encounter with the souls of those who died before and many topics .. The book is a soul about myself and my mind after the death of my father, may God have mercy on him
Tea with mint is a suitable name for a group of distinguished articles. When you read it, many feelings surround you. Warmth and intimacy. Some articles may cry for you and others make you lie on the back of the laughter, but in the end you realize that you have to stop moments to reflect on what you read, then you You read an expert writer whose satire is a token of sophistication that is pleasurable and has a graceful pen holder. Dr. Ahmed, I admit that I am one of your lovers.
The novel is a beautiful journey to connect to psychological peace ... All stages need to be implemented on the ground, a global novel, frankly .. At the end of the novel, but it was a very frequent repetition of a word that helped me, I enhanced its sensitivity by increasing it like this
Evaluation . The capacity of the apartment and the locationThe daily cleanliness of the apartment .. The weakness of the Internet in the internal rooms. The lack of a private receiver for the apartment and the imposition of specific channels on the guests. The weak payment of hot water in the bathrooms.
A beautiful hotel, Hayel hotel, the swimming pool is clean, the service is excellent, and the staff are very friendly and good-looking.
One of the best hotels I have visited. Breakfast is delicious. Service is available. Excellent disco. Price reduction
Despite his exceeded pages, I hoped that he had not finished. I hope to see other literature to refute many popular myths in other sciences. At the end of the book is a reference to some myths in medicine, but popular myths do not end with these two flags
Do you know what the homeland is Safia? The homeland is that not all of this happen. This most famous quote is the first thing that comes to my mind if a book referring to Haifa mentioned this before I read it, of course. I do not know how a book that does not exceed fifty pages reduces a human experience of that depth in a few lines. Ghassan Kanafani in Haifa walks you as if you see it in front of you with all its Arab details. The Palestinian cause turns into more than just memories or a stolen past, but it is a future issue, and in the end it becomes bigger than all, it is the human issue. Man is, after all, an issue. It was the closest thing to the sea, and it was the closest thing to the mountain, and between them extends the horror and loss of their invisible strands over a swamp of screaming, fear and unknown. I am crying for something else. It is a real Sabbath, but there is no longer a real Friday here and no one is real. And for us you and me, just search for something under the dust of memory, and see what we found under that dust ... new dust as well. We were mistaken when we considered that the homeland is only the past, as for Khaled, the homeland is the future, and so was the separation, and thus Khalid wanted to carry arms .. Tens of thousands like Khalid do not stop them tears spilled for men searching in the depths of their defeats for armor debris and flowers flee, and they are but They look to the future, and so they correct our mistakes, and the mistakes of the whole world .... He laughed hard, and felt that through that loud chuckling, he was pushing all his chest, tension, fear, and bereavement out of the chest, and suddenly he wanted to keep giggling and giggling until the whole world turned, or slept, or died, or pushed out into his car.
:. Book review video: : //. . / = .... The first novel by Izz al-Din Shukri, and it turns out that his style really evolved a lot in. The following accounts, but it is clear that one of the first things that he started with has the ability to draw the reader&#39;s attention to the end .. The novel is as if it were compilations of writings, novels and talk about Fakhr al-Din, a person who died and has an investigator investigating the cause of his death by going back to his past and history after the issue strangely closed. The novel in its six parts begins with the life of Fakhr El Din in his village and then the secondary period that had a great impact on changing his personality. The university period and his studies at the Faculty of Law and the psychological, emotional, and fateful fluctuations of Fakhruddin’s life, followed by the period he spent in the army that coincided with The timing of Iraq’s occupation of Kuwait, followed by his tenure as a lawyer and his relationship to his beloved Sherine .. See through all this the personality of Fakhruddin with its advantages and disadvantages, Fakhruddin is a very ideal person, adhering to his principles that accompanied him from childhood, loving to others but his biggest flaw is his pride that cost him a lot, He even cost him his soul at the end of each narration For those who knew him, he became more like a living corpse, alive but he lost his soul .. With the end of each chapter, one of them confirms the death of the pride of religion in a different way, this may lead to some people thinking that they are talking about the different pride of each of them, but it is the same pride of religion that was killed by his disappointment in his family and their betrayal To him after the death of his mother and father, he killed him, his first companions abandoned him with the first crossroads, the selfishness of the university comrades, the cruelty of the army, the brutality of the law firm and the greed of society, that Fakhreddin died more than once. And every time I make sure that the pride of religion in one form or another represents me at some point in my life .. The novel, although it begins with a police start, is a societal novel with a political character, we see the defects of society through the pride of religion, which is not without its own flaws as well, which we sympathize With her, or we decide to overlook her, because we see the cruelty of the world around him ... Debt is ideal, sometimes too much.
good. level of cleanliness. And the price. Bus service, especially in returning from the Haram, was not good twice. We waited more than forty-five minutes and my family was with me.
In the novels of her beauty, she did not want to be saved quickly because she is better connected to events and personalities.
How beautiful it is to read Al-Taliani&#39;s novel one day after receiving the International Prize for the Arabic Novel Booker This interesting novel that reformulated the events of the November coup in a combination of reality and fiction, the reality of political events in that era and the imagination of the characters that Shukri Al-Makhboot invented to address through it In addition to politics some of the social issues ... the novel dominates the local character, which made me frankly exclude while reading the award the prestigious award, but the jury disappointed me with good fortune ... But it must be noted that there are some deficiencies that could have been avoided, some Errors in a For Ragnan I acquired the second edition, some linguistic errors and some confusion in the events, whether political or in relation to personalities ... However, I am awaiting the next novel of the faded on the hottest of embers
It was very unfair to say that the last version of the Temple Secrets. Is it a response from the author Paul Sussman to the novel The Da Vinci Code? After looking at and reading the two, it came out that the two followed several points, which makes the individual say that they are the same, not the opposite? . The style of the novel .. historical police where you start. With a murder that brings us to successive events from the stories and legends of Lofu and the distant past of Da Vinci&#39;s paintings, he pondered some of his paintings, as he was making fun and hard of some religious beliefs. This is the first similar point in terms of style or type of novel, to be more precise. As for events, they revolve around a religious symbol that can show the power of belief and other heroes .. Here it seems that Paul Sussman has taken the same path with a religious symbol that may be used to ignite another war if it occurs with the wrong hands. My evaluation of the novel was going to be because it from the beginning was inconsistent. The reader cannot understand the course of the event. Except when it passed for the sixth semester .. But it included information that enriches the reader very creatively, so it was evaluated by a counterpart. Cultural, religious, and historical information that is evident and which reflects experience and culture. I still think, however, that the last mysteries of the Temple surpass the Da Vinci Code, perhaps because the characters were not walking, but were swept away by events, to create an unparalleled masterpiece, unlike this narration, where the monk was. Langdon and Sophie are walking to cover up the truth or hide it, as happened with the monk
I liked the idea of the book very much and it surprised me that the duet in some stories to see the male and female viewpoint in a story. It&#39;s fun. It is true that some of the stories came out very ordinary and I did not like it, but some of them were very enjoyable. As a whole I very much enjoyed reading this duet:
good. Cleanliness, reasonable price, and very good handling. The internet is not strong in the room and they are not cleaned except by your presence, but if it is time to go out, they will hit the door, and if you want, the door opens with masters, so that if you open the door in my absence and on my wife, because they did not respond to them, had it not been by chance behind the disaster, I tried to meet the person to smash his face, and I did not find it after I came back from abroad They have apologized to me and this is not enough.
The king is the king = one of us:. She talks about the lust for power and governance ... and how the throne transforms a poor citizen from Ghalban into a king with authority and authority.

Rest and recuperation. The hotel is very special and I recommend staying in it only needs higher speed Wi-Fi.
For the first time, it was better for me to read books before that. Finally, I settled on the topics of books that will be read in the future. The best book I have ever read.
O standing on the edge of the massacre. Show weapons. Death fell and the heart was rosary. And blood flowed over the scarf. The houses are shrines. The cells are shrines. And the range .. shrines. Take up the weapons. And follow me. I regret tomorrow and yesterday. Wrighty: Two bones ... and a skull. My motto: Morning
This is a book that the library of the families of all Muslims should not be devoid of .. It contains advice and preaching that I hold, and for it, in a beautiful, simple style, that can be read, and understood by the big and small ... A nice and light book is a number of articles of Sheikh Al-Tantawi, may God have mercy on him, which he published In different newspapers, or broadcast to listeners through Arabic radio stations .. I wrote these articles in different time periods, and included multiple topics, all of great importance to the Muslim community ... The grandson of the sheikh: Dahyan Mujahid collected, categorized and arranged these articles based on their subject, so they came The first group is to criticize negative social customs, and to talk about a To miserliness and spending through funny stories and attitudes lived by Sheikh, may God have mercy on him .. Then the second group of articles was a variety of. , Health, and happiness, then on education and exams, on boys and girls and education, and I liked this part very much, then on the beneficial work of charity, zakat and others ... Then two articles on death, and on marriage and divorce, long. The marginalization at the end of the book ... may God have mercy on the Sheikh and reward his grandson Mujahid for his efforts
Dunner Hotel Rating. I liked the hotel location, quiet and cleanliness. It does not have Wi-Fi

Exceptional. Signed.
Coronary for Ismail Fahd Ismail from prison literature. It is the last novel written by writer Bu Fahd in a year. Rather, it is one of the masterpieces of novels that triumph for human feelings. In it the author tells the story of pain and pain. Between the two brotherly countries .. As the writer’s affiliation with her .. Here, he holds the Kuwaiti nationality and there is a boy in Iraq .. The novel has political, cultural and human dimensions, proved the fertility of the writer’s thought and the imagination of the fertile and the extent of the capacity of reading and intelligence and his living with these current conditions .. with unique personalities .. Knitted with meticulous accuracy ... The writer addressed basic and other minor issues in a sophisticated manner ... so what is new in the novel of coronary birds? It is to shed light on the issues of the forgotten and the prisoners, and the crimes that took place under the sky of war and genocide. In a neutral way the two peoples were fair. They admired you the reduced feelings and feelings after several years ago from the Gulf War. Their embers are still burning in their souls ... I liked the novel a lot and how the writer fairly treated the Iraqi and Kuwaiti people alone, in a new style that no one had touched before, in a very wonderful language that inflamed my feelings And I made me cry crying.
Praise be to God, who blessed me with reading this book, explaining Sheikh Muhammad Abda. This book is one of the best things to read and one of the best things to learn is full of wisdom and preaching. I ask God to benefit Muslims. The book is great and has no dust, and the rest is left for review and audit
good. Tranquility and cleanliness of the place and the external view. The lack of staff in the reception to speak Arabic, which makes it difficult to deal with those who are not fluent in English. In the bathroom, there are no fuses beside the toilets. Thank you
My direct address will be on the next visit. . Cleanliness, decoration, and breakfast are varied and wonderful, the hotel design, complete calm, near restaurants, services, and groceries, and the smell of the hotel was beautiful, contrary to what is written in some comments .. The hotel&#39;s weakness is itself a strength, and it is the location and crowding Signs and positions around the hotel. Of course this negative point is not borne by the hotel and vice versa they have excellent parking service. And the other point is the somewhat delay in the check-in process, when I arrived to receive the reception there was no other guest, however the login process took about a minute.
My acquaintance with Simon Dibouvoir was through my reading of a book about the life of the Algerian mujahideen, Jamila Boubacha, where Simon at that time contributed to the internationalization of the Boyasha case, with the attorney Giselle Halimi and many others, like Kikasso, who made his feathers mobilize in order to place a beautiful within the framework of one of his paintings .... Then I decided to approach more than The character of Halimi did not come to mind except her book. This is a memoir of a committed or sober girl ... In fact, she was never sober but rather a mixture of rebellion and breaking the restrictions .... In this book, Depvoir touched on the transformations that she went through until she reached Simon the notebook .. There are details that the reader may agree with and others that he might discard, but in a Simon, the overall experience worthy of study and well worth the time spent by the reader in her readings ..
Nice experience. The reception and services are good. Bed hygiene needs more attention
Smile and welcome the receptionist. I liked the great manners of the receptionist, Mr. Abdulaziz, and the charming smile of a noble person, fit for the nobility of the hotel guests ..
Versace is an upscale hotel in the full sense of the word. Design, furniture, artboards and swimming pools. Check-in and check-out are very slow
I started reading the book about three months ago .. I read half of it with a high interest, recording many notes and questions that I wanted to search for their answers and attached these notes along the pages of the book, I had a great feeling that I would benefit a lot from the book, but after two weeks of diligence in Reading and writing notes The book fell into the hands of my niece, who was less than two and a half years old ... In my mind, I removed all sticky notes and began to tear and play with them .. When I saw the scene of torn notes, I completely lost my desire to complete the reading .... I returned to him between Every now and then .. And what helped me to complete it is that book p Bara on paragraphs separate from each other and the topics varied greatly .. Begovich had written these paragraphs as separate thoughts his imprisonment period in the eighties and was later compiled in a book entitled My Escape to Freedom..The book is interesting, useful and boring at times ... but I can only I am very impressed by Ali Izzat Begovich, a thinker, philosopher, literary critic and political leader ... may God have mercy on him. From the author&#39;s export of the book :. The value of these ideas does not lie in the ideas themselves, but in the circumstances in which they were written ... These scattered ideas were not collected except those days that exceed two thousand, they are comments on important events issued by a man who was prevented from participating in them, but He had an excess of time to follow her and present his own opinions about it, regardless of the validity or error of these views .. These are ideas about freedom, whether physical or intimate freedom, about life and destiny, on people and events, on the books that I have read and their authors, on imagined messages That my building was not written, in other words, everything that a prisoner would think of during those long days
The book is generally sweet and its ideas are varied. There are stories .. my wife loved me for one night. I really enjoyed reading this tree while we were in the cafe. And the stories remained cute. A sweet book, one separates it, among the fiction books
