Positive,Positive,"W Barcelona offers residential services I stayed at the W Barcelona from day to day, in a great room. I arrived early and registered my name at the hotel. The registration process is always busy, and there is a big and happy surprise but with mixed feelings. Sometimes your early arrival leads you to a room that no one else wants. My share of room number, was on the fifth floor. The beach was opposite my room, but a third of the view was obstructing me due to the other prominent rooms at the front. This only affects the first floors, so be careful, as each room ends with a number that has the same problem. These rooms are also adjacent to the storage and laundry rooms, among others. I loved the design of the room, the shared desk with the bed is very soft, what a really good bed spoil me, as well as the spacious space. The shower space can accommodate five people, not joking, so let’s consider, for example, that you took your boyfriend to have sex for the first time. You will inevitably discover the peculiarities of their bathroom laughing out loud. I did not consume anything from the room fridge, as there is a big store and restaurants at the beginning of the beach, and this is a pleasant walk away. Prices for the pool area and services are very moderate. On Sunday, on the top floor, you do not stop by the pool, the staff working in this area did not check the area even once, so I did not receive any services. Another day, I learned that the top floor was open, and I went up. I learned that it was closed when I asked for a service. Then I learned that it is not closed, but there is no service. I was just meters away from the main bar. The position of the workers in this area is as if they say, I know, man, that we are very calm. We do a favor for you here. However, I left the area and did not return to it for the duration of my stay. Hint I use the signs; I can&#39;t read minds, but if the staff is so lazy that they can&#39;t do the services upstairs, there&#39;s something wrong. At the nightclub, I was disappointed again because of the lack of communication, and the lack of signs or information about the region&#39;s protocols. I saw every two sitting on your sofas, so I had to leave completely. If there were signs, there would be no embarrassment for the people. After eleven o&#39;clock in the evening this region becomes private and the cost of staying in euros is where the excellent service provided by the workers once the place is opened. It seems that those who provide alcoholic beverages are good, but when they are busy like this then there will be speed, yet my drink was moderate. Wave Restaurant I had a very good meal, and a great attentive service made me happy. Managers always work hard, but sometimes regret can be an easy backup. Guest services What about the low seating for guests? Sitting in this drop feels as if the seat is the one sitting on you, the opposite must be done, according to the known power arrangement. And we ended up changing rooms, on the number floor, room number, which is the same type of room as it overlooks a port, after I mentioned that the wonderful rooms are supposed to have nothing to obscure seeing from them. Note that the warm rooms are located on floors from to; these rooms seem to be great except for rooms from to; all overlook the ocean and the harbor. As for all the large rooms and others overlooking the beach and the city. Location I did not find the location far from the old neighborhoods, so you can walk on foot, or take the bus number / which stops on the main road near the hotel entrance, and the price of the bus ticket. Euros, and the taxi may cost you approximately Euros. Overall, I would probably come here again, as the location fits in with me, as is the layout of the room, the bathroom was excellent and the two rooms were reasonably quiet. It was a shame there was the low pool service as well as what is known as nerve cooling. As the title shows, this place caters to a specific demographic as it focuses on it well, but I am not a fashion fan, but all I want is comfort and kindness. It is a service.

Positive,Positive,"The Rubaiyat of Khayyam is a philosophical poem with distinction in which faith is mixed with skepticism, pessimism with optimism, confusion with certainty, existence with nothing. Omar Khayyam invites them to enjoy life with all its pleasures, and what wine he praises in this work is only a symbol of this material life. Khayyam believes that our earthly life is much better than our eschatological life, adopting the nihilistic view of life, this life that has no meaning in all its tragedies and the misery of people in it and also what our emergency presence is in .. In this poem also there is an internal struggle between the life of the faithful tents who He wants to repent of his sins and the age of Khayyam, who doubts and revolts on religious concepts of fate, resurrection, and lastlife .. Indeed, there is still discussion about the ratio of these Khumaiyat quarters to Omar Khayyam, who was known for his morals and knowledge, but this does not prevent classification These quartets as a philosophical work explores the depths of the human psyche in their crises of existence Of this world Alamvhom and ruthless.

Negative,Positive,"This is a charade, as Dr. Mustafa Mahmoud said, it is inspired by what Sheikh al-Akbar Muhyiddin bin Arabi wrote about the counterattack, that is, the contradictory struggle within the human soul, when the soul wants something and wishes its opposite. And the text revolves, as the doctor points out about the apparent name, and he is the ruler and predominant of the people of the earth. Then the inner name, which is the ruler and predominant among the people of the subcontractor, who loves isolation, being alone, meditating and worshiping .. The conflict actually revolves between two personalities that represent controversy and conflict between the people of al-Zahir and the people of the subcontinent, or the worldly soul searching for pleasures and satisfying instincts. , And the blame soul searching for serenity and salvation .. The events of the representation that have been invalidated by a Sufi woman and her hero are represented by a man representing a outward personality, then a dialogue takes place between them, after which he ends up asking her to follow her, so she tells him that he will not be able to patience with her, and the taking continues The response to the speech in the context of an accelerated fiasco represents an opposing viewpoint ... just as it is complete Thelaya includes lyrical lyric connections, through which the heroine recites poetic passages from Ibn Arabi&#39;s poetry in a way that is appropriate to the context of the latest .. The hero’s ideas soon begin to collapse and the woman answers, saying: You trained my brain and thwarted my mind .. from you to God .. from you Allah. Then the events move on to talk about the injustice and negativity of the nation, the book includes a summary for this is: Muslims smoke hookahs in cafes and wait for God to be loved for them. And it is a shame .. and a fallacy even in the matter of their religion. After that, the book moves on to talk about the fundamentalist groups that have distorted the image of Islam by taking the path of violence. The doctor says: The Islamic groups have started from completely wrong beginnings and are still insisting on them .. which is an attempt to jump on power and usurp the rule .. And I thought that jihad begins From jihad with the other and conflict with the other .. I forgot that the jihad actually begins from the jihad with the soul and the struggle with the enemy that lies within the soul .. Satan, selfishness, fanaticism, the devil of intolerance, archeology, and madness of empty leadership ..

They are shouting at us by promoting the merchandise of Islamic terrorism that they made, funded, and rented to him the professional mafia gangs that raise the slogans of Islam .. to accuse our Islam of what was fasted With their Torah.

I don’t mind mixing colloquial with classical if he finds a strong justification for that .. Perhaps the second part of his style in which he wrote was tended because of the urgent need for the writer to develop the idea of the two books more. I was struck by the technical details and the details of business administration and development work .. In the end I was very impressed with the two works despite the drawbacks that I had on him .. Despite my feeling of some kind of boredom in the middle of the second part ..

Positive,Positive,"What makes someone special in his field is not just talent, but talent when it reaches the limit of madness ... I have always wondered ... Who is where Saramago comes with those imaginary societies? How can he weave a story where everything is so mixed up? In his writings, Saramago always creates a state of collective awareness that moves society as a single block towards something, or towards a strange event ... In death interruptions, the writer imagines ... what if death feels bored one day, and then decides to stop? What will happen ? What is the impact of that on the people of this community? He wonders in blindness .. What if everyone becomes blind? What could happen in a community of blind people? How do people deal with this phenomenon? He wonders here in Insight .. What if the people decide to challenge the government and not elect anyone? How does the government act on this? What will be the people&#39;s reaction to what the government did? Questions you may see as silly and silly, but Saramago grasps them wisely and weaves them into a solid and beautiful garment ... The answers to these questions, and the truth is said, illogical, and you may feel that they are unnatural .. But who said that Saramago is natural or logical? Didn&#39;t we just say that creativity that is not characterized by insanity is not creativity? Another thing that distinguishes Saramago is that he tells the novel in a reader-like manner, not a narrator, so you find him sometimes wondering what will happen in the novel shortly and sometimes updating himself with thoughts that revolve in his mind ... What really exhausted me is the narration style .. long breathless phrases .. lots and lots of sentences The objection that requires a present mind to pass it ... I saw this before in the interruptions of death and I thought it was a translation error, but I found it here too ...

It can be filled with dialogues that have no significance, for every scene does not exceed three to four minutes in length, and the transition between those scenes was made in a smooth and simple way without complications or neglected remedies, in addition to using paradoxes as a kind of dramatic plot of the story and the way it is presented in parallel to the events The success of director Fateen Abdel-Wahab in the logical choice of job heroes, especially the role of Madiha Yousry Kam, who performed so brilliantly at the same time in which she played the role of a fourth-year-old woman who takes care of her daughter with the help of her father and relates to the love of lawyer Talaat Ahmed Mazhar, who was able to another From providing serious and respectful work In addition to his works that have increased his stardom, even Madiha Yousry impressed me with the degree of her mature maturity in performing many scenes with sincerity and competence, and besides the role of the protagonist of the film Madiha Yousry and Ahmed Mazhar, it comes to the role of the star Nabila Obaid, although it is not the first work and that she has appeared in many The other works are more mature and older, but she successfully managed to present that little spoiled girl ...

As for coercion, the genealogy was flowing between the lines. It strikes under the belt by opening controversial topics and leaves it to the reader in his neutral style. Is Zidane a religious writer, is he biased to the ideas of Islam and nationalism, or is he just a neutral who exposes things to the satisfaction of a larger audience? In the end, I believe that it is a good novel, and I am eagerly awaiting the rest of its parts.

The writer started talking about the origin of the Turks, their conversion to Islam, and the establishment of the Ottoman Empire at the hands of Othman bin Artgrel. A nation that does not read its history is a lost nation between the darkness of ignorance and error, and this is our situation today. If we read our history well, we would know our enemies in our present as they were the enemies of our ancestors in the past. This book presents the plots woven against Islam and Muslims, such as Freemasonry and Zionism and how they used weak rulers to implement their despicable desires, such as Muhammad Ali Pasha, the governor of Egypt who was a poisonous dagger used by the enemies in the implementation of their plans. Between the lines of Ottoman history, my heart oscillated between the elation of the conquest of Constantinople at the hands of Mehmed the Conqueror and the deposition of Sultan Abdul Hamid II and the fall of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. At the end of the book, the writer appended the causes of the fall and collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

Positive,Positive,"The book is divided into two parts, the first part is the book itself, and the second part is the AKP and Turkish program. Part one: the book. Worth three stars. In my opinion, it was prepared by the second part of a previous book, but by another author, Ali Muhammad Muhammad al-Salabi. The book is the Ottoman Empire, the factors of rise and causes of the fall. The writer started the book from the time of the fall of the Ottoman Empire at the hands of Ataturk and quickly passed through the most prominent events that it passed through, especially the Islamic parties that took power like the National System Party .. Then he moved to a qualitative shift in the history of Turkish rule, which is Najm al-Din Erbakan and his parties Safety, Welfare and Happiness . In this brief, the features of the Turkish state, which are fiercely secular and loyal to the policies of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, are clear to us until the army interferes in its entirety if these principles are threatened and it performs a military coup if necessary, as it did in a coup when it carried out the coup against the Najmuddin government, the problem of the Safety Party. Then the author moves to the axis of the book, which is Erdogan, then he deals with the story of his origin and his disciples at the hands of Erbakan, then he took over the Istanbul municipality and arrested him, then he left and set up for the Justice and Development Party and passed on his three elections, the last of which was fought in the last year. The book in its entirety is good, especially in the tendency of Dr. Willing to simplify matters to suit the non-specialist. One of the bad deeds of the book was the photos in it. The book contained many pictures and it is an excellent way to clarify a lot of things, especially in maps and others, but the pictures here were misplaced and not selected accurately. They are normal pictures like Erdogan&#39;s and another image of a giant banner for his election campaign, and so if the images were selected more accurately, it would be an excellent thing. Part Two: The Party&#39;s Program. Worth five stars. The least described program as a program of understanding people. The program is based on a thorough study of the conditions and conditions of Turkish society, its capabilities and the resources available to it. A program made specifically to suit Turkey with its values, civilizational assets and available resources. Until you find that, for example, in talking about livestock, it identifies the best places for you to develop livestock. Part of fundamental rights and freedoms is one of the best approaches I&#39;ve seen, especially in its relevance to a country of a complex nature such as Turkey. The state is very secular, secular and loyal to Ataturk&#39;s policy, and the party is a party that draws its ideas from the correct Islamic approach and with a flimsy party policy, especially with the repetition of military coups, it becomes clear to us how bad the situation is, what did the founders of the party ?? They resorted to defining and defining concepts, especially with the relativity of political concepts, and created a marriage between the secularism of the state and the Islamism of the party in a wonderful political system. See in the program it. We see religion as one of the most important components of humanity and secularism as a necessary thing for democracy, with an emphasis on freedom of religion and belief and we refuse to distort secularism by making it in hostility with religion .. Secularism is a principle that allows everyone regardless of their religion and their belief in:. Freely practice their beliefs. Express their convictions the way they want to live. At the same time, secularism gives those who do not owe a debt mainly the right to organize matters of their lives consistent with this trend .. And when he spoke about the policy to which they seek they said about it. Politics is the will of society to build a present in accordance with sound rules and foundations and to carefully plan its future. There is a lot and a lot in the party’s program, but it must be emphasized that the only benefit in my opinion from this program is specialization. Each country has its own principles, values, and available resources that can be exploited. Each country must have its own experience of being affected by other experiences, not by blind transportation or application

Positive,Positive,"A novel is not wonderful in style and presentation of events, but it has facts that we cannot obliterate the revolution that we are going through now or if you want so say the coup history witnesses that Egypt is a country without a single revolution but the topic is in its entirety and the writer addressed this issue in particular it indicates a broad horizon and the end is unfamiliar in our Arab circles It was natural or stereotypical that the hero who killed many be imprisoned, but also the idea of the novel mimics the novel of Gram Vipers almost the same topic, but with some vaccinations that did not change the environment. The hero is a pharmacist, and the events clarify to some extent what the pharmacist suffers in our reactionary Egyptian society. How did we transform that profession into mere hands that transmit the drug only? Also, the vipers ’gram was also a note that is not longer noticeable from the frequent eating that Ahmed Murad tends in his novels and works to the degree of cost not to add new To events and will not affect if deleted.

Positive,Positive,"A very important discovery this year. Wonderful Wadih Saadeh. Have you heard about nihilism? Here nihilism will smell and breathe in his words. The office is wonderful and elegant prose. I chose for you these two syllables. . The dusters. The desolate roads of Habun alone. The earth has become dust, and here we are completing the life of dust .. We are continuing the life of the dust of the earth. This is someone who must complete his life, and here we do .. We do not complete the life of the earth, but the life of our dust. We do not complete life, but death. We came to accompany the dust in his last blow, we carried him to his resting place, and we slept with him .. The land was not like us. It is our opposite and we are its ruins. We did not come to complete that land, but to denounce it. We did not come to continue, but to deny .. No religion before us, no religion after us, no religion. Dusters without religion or religion, for dust is nothing but aerosols. They swim in a vacuum. In space whose mother or son does not Earth. In the paternity vacuum and the sonship vacuum. We are going to our God, to nothing .. We are the dusters, and this is what we saw in our blowing, this was not something before it became dust, it was nothing before we became dust. . Beauty transit. Beautiful fast transients. They don&#39;t leave a shadow. Perhaps a little dust, it soon disappears ... the most beautiful among us, abandoned his presence. Leaving a clean room vacant seat. Beautiful in the air in the absence of his voice. Clarity in the dirt with its uncultivated area. The most beautiful among us: the absentee .. Boycott the place and boycott the time lightly. Do not leave the place to overturn it, nor for the time to waste it. He devoted himself in the quick blowing, leaving no one who left his bed or wheat for his field. Retracted from the condition of walking to reach. Withdrawal from access .. Transit quickly as a migrant angel. Not leaving residency may be a place of sin. Not committing a sin, not committing a residence ... quickly under a sun that does not touch him, under rain that does not wet him, on dirt from which no impact remains. Quickly without trace, no legacy, no legacy .. He did not have enough skills to learn a language. He did not have to absorb habits. He has no language, habits, teachers, or students. Passing over language, above customs, above ranks, names and imitation ... without a name, above calling and calling ... and above gestures, except for the gesture of crossing ... and without sound, because the sound is heavy in the air ... because the sound may collide with another. It might crush another sound in space. It may disturb the breezes ... and without desire. Because the desire to establish steadfastness .. transients quickly beautiful. Do not reside in a place in which to leave the ugliness. They do not have enough time to leave a stain in the memory of the residents ... who stayed long with us, leaving spots on the fabric of our memory that we do not know how to erase them ... painful spots, wherever it is on the seats, so that we can no longer sit .. long residents take away our seats. They turn our home furniture into pieces. So that we sit, if we sit, on their ribs, on their bones ... the resident residents are crushed. As for those who pass, they do not crush anyone and no one crushes them. They shall not be trampled upon beings, nor be burdened with footsteps. Even the air does not hint at them for a moment ... without anxiety, regret, gods or followers. One faith for them: crossing ... abandoning places, homelands, fathers and sons. Restrictions. The vandals of the gallows made of iron, place, time and belonging .. They are falling, one after another, clinging to the residence. Falling with their homelands, which became an illusion. Their affiliations, which became a lie. With their paternity, which has become a burden. With their faith that kills us, kills them, and kills life ... transients have no victims. Do we therefore have to glorify life quickly, to glorify its transit, to glorify suicide? Lightly bird whisk and open Aura wing. The openness of the transit air was lightly open, and the starting air did not pass .. They passed quickly, as a moment of diminution .. They had a voice from the sparrow, from a branch, a look, from a blossoming Shamim .. their birds to sing and leave, not to be imprisoned in cages or paved in mummified facades. Their birds are the traveling spirit, not the feathered resident .. and their fragrant fragrant flowers outside the pot ... other than the traveling, the indifferent, the tampering with the residence, the possessed, and the dead, who would have discovered the beauty of crossing? And what moment does life discover more than the moment of its absence? Is it necessary for the leave to be authenticated more than the residence permit? And, therefore, should our life be just an exercise in the beauty of leaving? The most beautiful of the departed. The most beautiful suicide. Those who did not want anything and did not take anything. Those who took one step in the river were enough to discover the waters ... the most beautiful of us who are not among us. Those who left us are light, leaving modestly, their seats for people who may come now, to this party ... a silly party, and yet the tenants do not leave the seat. But why not seats, as long as the celebrities start guests and end enemies? Let us go, then, lightly, before the daggers swallow us up, before we make the banquet dish .. The moment of reaching the celebration is the beauty of the celebration. And then, soon, the beauty becomes the departure. The departure step is always the most beautiful. The departed are mixed with the breeze. As we stand to make funeral for them, let us commemorate their memory also. Because memory hinders their departure, brings them back to their place, makes them inanimate ... Memory hinders those who wish to die. And make those who want to live dead .. Let us bury it then .. to bury the memory while we sing .. It is a silly party in any case, but since we have arrived, let us sing and dance .. seconds, we may be beautiful .. but the most beautiful will remain: the absent .. Thank you Oh wonderful, I will make sure to read the rest of your work. And scheduling them within my plans

Positive,Positive,"Your only proof of freedom remains when Victor Hugo decided to present his novel The Miserable in the nineteenth century, he did not know that it would turn into this great cam of art, which met with artistic and public success and demand, and became the primary source for many of them, so the genius director Tom Hopper came to present it once Others are in a musical saga, creating a different atmosphere, with perfect craftsmanship, as if you are watching her heroes on stage and not in front of a lyrical movie. With every scene, you will feel a desire to applaud the director Huber&#39;s ingenuity in pushing his actors to sing directly in front of the camera until you feel with their voice sadness and imprisonment and To the extreme anger of what they are subjected to, and that feeling will not diminish when you rush to sing with them as if you are one of them, as well as his skill and strength in choosing the actors especially the actress Anna Hathaway who succeeded with great mastery in presenting the character of Fantine, and despite her short role but her strength in performing the character was drawn A basic line for her in the movie, and she presented an aesthetic image of the mother and her great sacrifice. And the performance of each of the two stars Russell Crowe, and Hugh Jackman will not be less than the same power of Hathaway, where everyone succeeded in increasing the beautiful meanings of the novel, and far from the well-known story that was presented as much as we mentioned and I mention among them a wonderful Atef Salem, which was starred by the Egyptian screen monster Farid Shawky, this time he is forced The elves went to steal a loaf of bread, and then he is sentenced to prison. After leaving, he escapes from observation, and the officer remains sentinel looking for him to bring him back behind bars ... We find that the writer that Boublil focused in the dialogue on the true message that Hugo always presents in his writings and writings where the human message is presented through Deep dimensions were represented by a guy B freedom of mankind, oppression and injustice to which it is exposed and the bad social conditions that oppress it, the most important of which is ignorance .... An-Nahah, especially the first song in the opening of the movie, which, if indicated, indicates the oppression that a person is exposed to, as well as a song and other beautiful songs written by Claude Michael Schoneberg. Unfortunately, the place here will not help me to mention all the aesthetics in the film, but all I can mention and say that the film deserves to be You see it more than once in addition to being among the best elephants On a divorce, and it must be kept within your movies library.

The novel discusses the changes that occurred in the Egyptian society in the seventies and eighties, where the economic openness began to migrate to the oil countries and the repercussions of those changes from social problems that reach the level of disasters through a group of related or distant stories, even if they all share in its painful return on the reader.

Zidane elaborated on explaining Arabic theology and shred it. As for the connection of religious violence with theology, it was not clear or sufficient, but rather was closer in his conversation with creation. The book is very good and I hope you see it, but one book is definitely not enough to be an objective and comprehensive view.

Positive,Positive,"Championship, motivation and the main driver of events are the revolutionary idea and situation and the desire to make a fundamental change in society, not people. The idea that Dostoevsky clearly declares his wish to change and rebel for a better life is why people give such great attention to others&#39; opinions about them, that they control their lives and are considered their weak point and through which they can easily control them with the remote control. The analysis is still waiting for me to have the opportunity to give him the right to write in detail, perhaps after finishing the second part. When I had the opportunity to complete what I started, I found that the supplement was required:. You are confused as you approach the end of this chapter in the classification of characters .. From a good and a wicked person in particular Nikolai Staffogen .. He and his friend Peter are very complex and very complex personalities that curse them sometimes sympathize with them and seek excuse for them. In the end, you really find yourself wondering: Will I know at the end of the novel who the demons are, and whether they include the father and teacher Stephen Trovimovich .. He is the other who seems to suffer from diseases of selfishness, negativity and inaction, the inability to resolve any issue or make any decision .. These characters are considered to be rejected characters in Societies preparing for a fundamental social change in them, where the negative intellectual is hated and undesirable .. It does not provide, but delay. One of the most wonderful dialogues in the novel is Stephen&#39;s dialogue with Varvara Petrovna, when she attacked him violently, accusing him of wanting to exclusively acquire knowledge, and in return, he despises others on the pretext that he is more knowledgeable .. He is stingy with his knowledge so he is responsible for what they reached and directly to. But we find that he himself is frank with himself and reveals it in front of his friend, the narrator, and confesses that he is like a capricious child, who has many freaks, and he says: You have put your finger, my friend, on a painful sore point, and that the friendly fingers are cruel, merciless, but lack civility. Sometimes I think of this woman, Farvara Petrovna, who has reached that whole amount of generosity, tolerance and patience towards my bad faults, the truth is that she is not a lot of patience. But is it permissible for me to complain about the bad nature of myself, who I likened to the child in extreme selfishness without having the innocence of the child ?? As usual, in light of societal developments, we find that there is no dialogue between the heroes of any revolutionary movement that is free of these sentences that bounce by rebelling against the frozen ideas that the clerics boil in order to control the poor of society and compel them with religious authority to accept the class differences and the abhorrent reality to them, this sentence came to Stefan Trofimovich:. The more painful a difficult life for a person, and the more miserable persecuted people are, the more persistent the dreams of rewards that they will receive in Paradise. And of course, you do not find a society devoid of the likes of Leputin the chatter, the gossip that does not stop rhythm among some friends to control them and know their weaknesses and influence them through them ... And we find that this is what Ibn Stephan excelled in controlling the wife of the ruler, which is what we will find in the second part The conflict rages, and the ends begin to take clear paths

Positive,Positive,"Wonderful book, including the meanings of the letters. Very light despite the amount of information presented in it and its ease of absorption, especially for those who are not inclined to books on philosophy and religions. The author got off to a strong start with those heavy questions in the eyes of those who are ignorant of it and simple in view of those who worked hard to know the details of our religion, Islam. So the difference between Islam and other religions is thank God that I was aware of the answer in advance, if somewhat shallow. Hence, the story of the search started with Ben Atheism, Christ, Gentiles and others. I learned many things that I went through daily and I never thought of them as the names of the gods and their meanings. And how it has become the names of famous landmarks, brands and others. Also, I always wondered why they worshiped the Buddha to this degree. Ignorance reached them, so the writer explained the story of the Buddha, why did people start worshiping him, etc. In addition, I liked his dialogue with foreigners, and his attempt to lure them without fanaticism, leaving them with a chance to think without pressure. In particular, his conversation with the woman, and how verses from Surat Al-Nisaa misinterpreted what is apparent in front of her and not in the hidden sense. Here lies the miracles of the Qur’an, and we do not learn from the Qur’an from the first reading and the first thought, but it requires care, attention and effort to take all the benefits from it, so let the Qur’an be the spring of our hearts. As for his visit to the church, my curiosity has increased around me for as long as I wanted to explore it from the inside and I am trying to enter into dialogue with them, except my fear prevents me and the poverty of information brings me back steps. In a chapter, a soul, and their pastors, he spoke about human personalities and their types inferred from the Holy Qur’an, and he impressed me. The book as a whole is very useful, showing the writer&#39;s eagerness to deliver information in a simple and clear way despite the diversity of information. He did not hesitate to put evidence from all religions. There is a quote that I like the quotation of German physicist Werner Heisenberg. You will likely become an atheist when you drink from the cup of knowledge, but be absolutely certain that you will find God awaiting you at the end of the cup

Then how the repression that happened to the Awakening in general and the jihadists in particular in the mid-nineties. What made many after their release tend to Al Qaeda and the global jihad that many were not convinced before this suppression because it causes a lot of controversy unlike the classic jihad that comfort the Saudi mind more since it is an aggression against an infidel gas in Chechnya, for example, the author progresses with history down to The September events that caused al-Qaeda to direct its operations into Saudi Arabia after the fall of the Taliban in Kabul, and how the dispute between al-Zawahiri and bin Laden was against al-Eiri, who saw the inappropriate time to launch an attack inside the kingdom, but bin Laden’s insistence and launching suicide attacks gradually weakened al-Qaeda to That almost ended.

Needless to say, the Egyptian intelligence apparatus was originally created by the Americans, to establish the covenant In which they replace the late English occupation at the hands of their agents and their military guilty criminals who were criminalized in the right of their nation unless the occupation itself criminalized .. Khurshid was able to appear in the media after the January Revolution, but the book remains more important than its TV interviews, although in these meetings more What about the book .. And the most important thing I see D focus on him from the lessons and benefits of this book: that a person under tyranny loses all his defensive elements and all kinds of his dignity, even the innate ones, so he can accept that the husband of a woman knows everyone that she is another lover, and accepts to marry a woman who knows that she is another partner .. Because resistance to tyranny rises to the level of duty imposed on every free person, silence does not exempt from damages.

But as soon as the individual engages in an audience, he takes the traits of what he was there or it can be said that they exist, but he did not dare to reveal it and express it. The individual, once engaged in an audience, loses his mentality, acts reasonably and is governed by emotions. Inspiring images and cheerful slogans are what take over the soul of the audience. Even tyrants are eager to inspire the imagination of the masses and the flames of their enthusiasm. A beautiful book, I recommend reading it, especially in these days in which we live because of the revolutions, demonstrations and sit-ins

As everyone mentioned .. Lots of spelling and language errors .. The dialogue that took place between Omar and the leader of the Arab camp, who was an aide to the Mujahid, a speech that God has mercy on and accepted as a martyr: ? He said that its people are the best on earth. Of course, as it is known .. the hadith is weak ... and we in Egypt are now suffering from the scourge of the spread of this hadith as correct. So it caught my eye very hard .. I wanted to mention it. Most of the dialogues revolve around the issue being the issue of the homeland in the first place ..

I still have to point out a few minor negatives: / Contradiction: the page of an honest wound on the left hand, a page on the right .. / Some English phrases have errors, which may be typographical .. / Confusion between the vocabulary of the leg and the leg, the humerus and the forearm .. / Excessive use of impulses, intimidation, impulse ... etc. Wrong use, and stylistically monotonous .. / Combining wheat from the flesh of simile, it looked like someone feeds a gold ring with stones from Zalat .. The writer&#39;s style evolved a lot from his first novel, and his rhetorical skills were evident, but they needed linguistic refinement. He had mentioned at the signing ceremony of the novel his reading of the book of jurisprudence Al-Thaalabi, and he meant the jurisprudence of language and it is a small heritage book, despite its importance does not fit our time. The first is that the dictionaries of error and linguistic correctness, the best of which are written by Dr. Ahmad Mukhtar Omar ..

The personality of Sheikh Al-Janzeer stands out as an example of someone who is investing bad debt. And the left-leaning Gibran left for power. And it casts the girl as a symbol of seduction in the eyes of males, despite the simplicity of her personality. The most prominent hero is Azmi Al-Wajih, who represents the mysterious side of the story .. The novel takes place in the capital, Amman, starting from Jabal Al-Joufah, a popular region to expand the geography of the novel later to extend to Jabal Amman, Luweibdeh and West Amman, shedding light on the social patterns of these areas .. The novel appears boldly to break it The so-called narrative taboos Religion Sex Politics with reservation that many may take on sexual employment within the literary text presented between our hands in the novel .. We discussed the novel in the presence of its writer in a book in December and according to the author&#39;s description, the novel reveals the basic aspects of the city&#39;s society that is hidden On many political, religious, sexual, and social transgressions and practices, while keen to exaggerate the bright aspects in order to hide what is left out

Positive,Positive,"I like it very, very much, especially since I am one of the people who try to avoid Facebook, in which it has successful attempts and many failed. He tells you that the real name of Facebook is alone together. For example, if you are on a trip before the appearance of Facebook in the first place, you will listen to the journey and your friends, and in every detail there is possible now after you are there. You feel that you see a need, want to do bad things, and want to upload pictures and prove to the whole world that you are happy and not focused Originally with the trip, nor with your friends, you are centered on the screen. I described a lot of Elvis I like it as a mirror that masquerades as a window and a vampire. For the sake of absorbing our time, attention and energy. If Inspector Vis had limited his companions ’term, they would meet him with a question as to why he was absent and his return to real life would be the concept of absence. In addition to the psychological problems caused by Facebook from. . And away from the fact that each one has an electronic folder with such a company, and in it there are already companies that occupy it, that they coordinate each individual&#39;s folder. And Elvis is free because it offers an expensive commodity. I don&#39;t mind that it sells your personal information to anyone, if you are a famous person or you will remain. Frankly, he said all that I want to say about Elvis and that life was more calm and sweeter than others. On a personal experience: I did not actually inspect Elvis for about two months, due to circumstances beyond my control, in the first days of this I was tense, fanatic, and sensitive, that I missed my whole life, and I was living in a different world, far from my companions and acquaintances, after a week passed, I felt that I was calm and I said God life without a beautiful face I went back to most of the needs I love by following a program with Mama or listening to the radio and using the phone. I ask him about my friends who really loved me. With the first meeting I had with my companions, I was enjoying, and I don&#39;t want to go home, I want to spend the longest time with them, and really happened despite it being a period of exams .. there was no need for my annoyance other than the needs of the people I love and I do not have their phone numbers I mean, Elvis is the only way I see The second need is the needs in my studies that I want to know, and I can only reach them via Facebook. At the first opportunity I had, so I could see people who did not know their news except from Elvis. Also, there are normal words that will be said in return for him, who knows how to influence my meeting with the people I wrote face to face, even though the speech is far from disturbing me. During the absence of Facebook, I was meeting with them, and I really felt that they made me crazy, and that there was no need for me to meet them. The bottom line, if there is any way for me to overcome my needs that I am in, so I can cancel it immediately and take the electronic suicide step:

I think anyone reading a hundred years of isolation will notice that there is a terrible similarity between the two versions. How to deal with characters and passage from one character to another, and deal with the death of the characters of the novel. Almost until the same period. The events of the novel took nearly a year. At first, I thought the similarity was a coincidence. But when the similarities were met with so many things, I ruled out the chance and thought that Radwa Ashour was intending to do something like a hundred years of isolation. Frankly, I do not know this is sweet or not? We can consider that she appreciated the need to do as great and valuable the Marquise business if that was a good thing.

How sweet is to live a sincere romantic situation under the auspices of the Romantic Ambassador and her philosopher. The book is a letter filled with a passionate desire and formulated with the best rhetorical images, and this is something expected when the two parties are Al-Rafii, Mai Ziadeh or Marie Ziadeh ..

Some sources mention that she has many lovers, including Al-Rafii, but the most prominent of them is Gibran Khalil Gibran, and she is the only one who declared her love after a year of their relationship. On my opinion of the book:. A love from a third party. This was my feeling, it is very strange that you look at the messages of lovers. It is more surprising that you learn from them how to formulate the meanings that your heart does not conjure up and cannot formulate your pen .. It means my country like this ... One who loves one and I in the spirit of sitting with them like this:.

Which I think is a wonderful literary energy and talent that has not yet been discovered, although this is normal in the first novel, and I am confident that the next work will achieve a much greater resonance after Sherine made a balance of confidence in the taste of everyone who read the work, and mobilized an audience waiting for her new creativity ... Language: attractive and coherent, indicating a writer who was a good reader in the first place, and not from that prevalent style that decided to write just because he had read a work or two, as the writer seemed to be influenced by the Naguib Mahfouz School in caring for the narration and detailed description, and the use of the smooth dialogue language Simple, closest to colloquial in dialogue .. Characters: Each character has its own language A, her style, and her way of speaking, which confirms that the writer made for each character a file with all the details about her before proceeding to write, so that she does not fall into the trap of mixing between the way she speaks and the way the characters speak in which many authors fall, especially in their first works ... plot Coherent and interconnected. Rhythm: The rhythm could have been more vibrant and active in short some marginal matters and not digressing in them, but there is nothing wrong, because the current rhythm is acceptable and not slow in a very moving way. Cover: One of the most beautiful and coolest covers I have seen in the past three years, and has a magical ability to stick to memory and stick to it no matter how the eye sees after it other covers, as well as its complete suitability to work in a way that makes it difficult to imagine a cover other ... I liked high heroine to work to the extent The disease is with her, because she is the human being that she loved and was not associated with, and she lost and lost with another person, and she is the sister that her older brother did not feel and she strayed, and she is every girl who was a project for a successful human being, but the good intentions were not sufficient to make those dreams come true, and I wished that she had found them before they were lost. To protect her and I hope others do that before it is too late ... What did not satisfy me at work is that, like most Arab women&#39;s literature, despite my reservation to this classification, it often focuses on the pain of the oppressed female victim, but the truth is said that the restriction of the butterfly succeeded in attracting me to its world and forced me to abandon this distress from that problem without paying attention except me and me On the last page, I think Sherine Sami will be smart enough to get out of this cocoon in her new work to navigate other worlds, just as her dear Sherine Hinai succeeded in getting rid of that syndrome.

Negative,Positive,"This is a book against the narrow, exclusive, puritan and simplistic concept that reduces the full identity to a single affiliation advocated angrily. Against the widespread, very malicious and very dangerous way of thinking that diminishes identity because it puts men in a prejudiced, sectarian, fanatic, authoritarian and sometimes suicidal position and turns them often into murderers or supporters of murderers. Amin Maalouf calls instead to imagine our identity as being made up of multiple affiliations so once we see in ourselves and in our origins various, accurate, and contradictory intersections, contributions, hybrids and influences until we have a different relationship with others. Amin Maalouf believes that we often exaggerate the impact of religions on peoples, while neglecting the opposite of the influence of peoples on religions and criticizes the widespread opinion in the West, which easily sees in Islam the source of all the evils suffered by the societies that belong to it .. And believes that there is no point in asking what It says the truth of Islam, Christianity or Marxism if we seek answers and not merely to affirm negative or positive prejudices, then we should not be entrusted with the essence of belief but rather with the actions of those who have been relying on it throughout history. He says somewhere else. The twentieth century taught us that there is no liberal doctrine in itself. All beliefs can be deflected, and all can be deformed and all their hands are stained with the blood of communism, liberalism, nationalism, all of the major religions, even secularism. Nobody has a monopoly on fanaticism, and on the contrary, no one monopolizes what is Humanitarian . Finally, the wish made by Amin Maalouf at the end of his book seems very far away, or almost impossible, at least for our time.

Positive,Positive,"I am sad that the body, as well as the soul, does not have wings flying in the sky, but that one has a permanent ambition that drives him to the perches and forward. Faust the man whose soul always aspires to the highest but cannot endure staying, he is imprisoned in his body and himself .. Faust the person who goes himself down to the world of the earth and desires but he cannot stand survival because his instinct refuses to degenerate .. And between these two oscillates the power of the soul and the strength of the soul and all of them They gravitate to him .. But Faust is the European man who wants to be a part of the upper world never descends, he wants to be an ideal honest family surrounding everything. And I think this is what Goethe criticizes, which causes him to fall down and accompany Satan himself, seducing women, killing and harming them. But with all his crimes, a person insinuates and breaks his fast ... in the night of the Aalborg and Revelation Night Burg, which is a party for the king of the jinn and attended by demons and goblins. And in this chapter Goethe criticizes and analyzes in short terms various philosophies .. He says: Many dreams: The dreams that filled my imagination, have tyrannized to me this time, ie tyranny. And for my life, if all my delusion is now true, then today I am a mad fool. . A man of tangible facts. Being here is a source of my suffering and suffering. For the first time in my life, he showed me not sure of myself, and my faith is about to be shaken. . All of this is the first part of a novel that Goethe has embraced for years and has left us with a lot of smack yet. In the second part, Faustus returns, regrets, and repents to show Adam’s first human .. The translator’s language is good and clear, but he interfered to explain in the footnote the purpose of Goethe and what it means and this I think is confiscation of the reader and this is not his place, and if he wanted to mention that in his introduction or In an independent literary and critical work. And this is what I did not like and it was repeated a lot.

And the history of the Islamic conquest of the countries of Morocco. And how the state fell and only carried the name. And its people returned to the pre-Islamic customs. And how it regained its glory again with Abdullah bin Yassin. He who started the bond with the Senegal River and five who answered his call to pray. Then the country would expand.

Positive,Positive,"Love is nothing but a state of loss of self-confidence in which sublimation is portrayed to us, and it is only a compensation for that deficiency. With this theory, the book made me come up with new perceptions of situations that emptied the soul, which I cannot explain, and after that I was able to overcome them and gain more control over such feelings. The book needs in-depth reading from my point of view, frequent pauses, connectivity, and internal discourse critical of the writer&#39;s opinion and the feelings of the soul. I have to admit to myself that the book took me out of an internal psychological conflict after an emotional trauma and made me aware of the steadfastness which is the truth that I believe in reading therapy

I was very surprised when I learned that many call Rosy that he is secular and secular, as far as I know: He separates religion and the world. This is the opposite of what he does in my opinion. Belief in the unseen and the soul does not indicate that there is no logic behind it and should be sought and knowledge of it, just as belief in death is a right does not mean that there are many causes that lead to it and its study is desirable ..

It will remain the truest author of what the author wrote, but Dr. Mustafa&#39;s writings are characterized by a strong sense and symbolism characterized by two things .

I immediately refrained from many books and refrained from acquiring many of them for several reasons that were established after many visits to these commercial libraries: What is permanently observed in it is the abundance of nausea and absurdity in the Arab cultural product, from publications and books.

The price of prices is not tolerated by the largest proportion of shoppers and even members of the class Medium compared to an average sized book is not worth all that high amount. The Internet has enriched many books such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, books of information and the like, there is no need to purchase these books and spend huge amounts of money on it, and there is something that sings them in electronic ways easier .. Having a long row of books awaiting reading in my library and my home, there is no need to multiply from other books, But just a simple renewal and additions here and there ...

I was surprised at the accountant that they were all inadvertently novels, although I do not care much about them, but I balance them with many other cultural and intellectual books .. I returned home I went to the ground and put the narrators around The four T and a computer open to technical materials, I imagined that the owners of these novels and those technical material are sitting around me in a unique episode as if most of them are dead cultural preparation session. Yahya Hakki and I were with his novel Qandil Umm Hashem ... With us Taha Hussein and his novel Al-Ayyam .. There is a neighborhood between the living and it is Amin Maalouf and his African novels Lyon. Then the late Naguib Mahfouz and some of his chatter over the Nile .. And to Qusay&#39;s corner there had been since Anis Mansour and his days came in the Akkad Salon, but I did not join him in that unique session. And me with him a bitter pause later. In a heterogeneous manner, Bill Gates and a lengthy technical material were with us, a study from me for one of the endless Microsoft technical certificates .. I was confused about where to start and what I commend and who I will triple to him but the opinion settled from the subconscious of the wonderful late Yahya Hakki and his unique Qandil or Hashem In which he made his reputation as a work of the most important works of the short or slightly long story in the twentieth century .. We are here talking about a story written since the forties of the last century and you have always heard about it and read a lot of praise and praise in the books and cultural and literary circulation circulated, and perhaps the most important of those singled out in criticism in That time with a wonderful article is Al Adi By the martyr Syed Qutb, may God have mercy on him, then added to his valuable book: Books and Characters. Until the beginning of this article, it will captivate you and inform you that a flood of praise will spell out this story and this fictional creativity. When Sayyid Qutb opens this article to:. Oh Yahya Hakki ... where are you, man ... I wish I had the executioner&#39;s whip, lazy creator. . Syed continues to list my talents and creativity and compare them to Timur and others .. When he mentions that my right is less productive compared to others, but it is distinguished by type, quality, and talent in this little .. As for Timur, for example, he writes, writes and writes, and he must come across a good thing in this much that he writes. I also remember what the late scholar Mahmoud Shaker Abu Fahr wrote in his valuable book, False and Asmar about that humble man who visited him one day for the first time in his house with a writer and then contacted him later asking him for permission to be his friend and to visit him continuously that was the humble man Adeeb Yahya My right, since they have become close friends since then, and some sources attribute the professorship to Shaker and the apprentice to my right to death, may God have mercy on her in the last decade of the twentieth century .. So all these introductions that I have read, heard and seen about Yahya Hakki and Qandil or Hashem made something inside of me Great about this writer and his production so maybe p Some think that I have made the issue of ruling on it, and it is an easy issue, and it has a look and a blurring upon it. However, really despite all that, I was missing a lot, many, and not the inspector like the informant and anyone who tasted the custom. Every wonderful description about Qandil or Hashem and the smoothness and aesthetics of the language and style of Yahya Hakki Al-Qasasi does not all enrich that description from the moments of his reading and taste. For the first time, I read a story on many of my reading of this literary genre with this wonderful language, the smoothness of words and the splendor of the method that penetrates into the souls of the soul and does its act, for when you read to revive my right and specifically Qandil or Hashem, it is as if you drink water, or sip honey with its ingenuity in language love and draw pictures with ease and elegance Verbal grace .. Qandeel Umm Hashem’s story revolves around that young Ismail, whose rate does not qualify him for admission to local Egyptian colleges, and his father decides to send him abroad in Britain in order to complete his studies and return to a doctor that the family is proud of despite the hardships of distance, separation and financial pressure on the family because of this only With distress .. that villager turns to another man in Britain who bites, befriends, breaks, and also succeeds in his studies and returns to an ophthalmologist, but he is a doctor who revolts against customs, traditions, sophistication, and amulets, defying and praising against the current trend to dare and carry his stick and smash a lamp Hashim, that lamp suspended over the shrine of the lady takes the poor from Its oil to treat their patients with all their diseases and offer gifts and gifts to him .. The result was that the simple people of the neighborhood revolted against him and beat him until he nearly died to be rescued by his former colleague, the guard of the mausoleum and his shepherd .. The young doctor then decides to treat his fiancée, the ruminants in her eyes with his modern form, in which he has recovered dozens in a Britain. But her condition gets worse day by day until she almost loses sight .. In the end the young man reaches the stage of reconciliation between his youth and his traditions and returns to visit the shrine .. The shrine of the lady is not dispensed with his modern treatment .. This is the story in short, which will not make you need to read it of course, but The last sentence, perhaps, summarizing the whole idea of the story, which is dealing with crises of interaction between East and West. Between the backward East that has just looked for the glamor of Western civilization. Between the sight of the West and the insight of the East. Between the mind of the first world, and the spirit of the third world. Between decades and centuries of eastern backwardness and delay, and recent years of superiority and terrible western scientific progress .. This was the preoccupation of intellectuals and writers of preoccupation in the half of the twentieth century with the era of colonialism and the end of its end, so people were three types :. A class that satisfied the West with its advantages and disadvantages and decided to merge with it and completely strip it of its identity .. It classified completely closed to itself and closed the windows with many arguments until those withered and died .. And an intermediate class between this and that closed the doors as it all opened the windows and received the new with its advantages and disadvantages ... Perhaps this last class It is what Yahya Hakki, may God have mercy on him, tried to display and address through the story of this rebellious and confused young man between his traditions and his society who was looking at him with contempt and disgust and then reconciled and appreciated after that after he realized that there is no mind for the West without a soul for the East .. Is this conflict over? I do not think so, and still we are witnessing many civilized traumas who first went to the homes of the West, its universities and institutes to send his speeches from there despising its societies, universities, students, and curricula ... not reconcilable neither with himself nor with his family repeating the same mistakes and negatives. May not benefit his community, even in the end, what he learned and studied. He benefited himself .. quotes. Yahya Hakki formulates and casts all of this with unparalleled linguistic creativity and intellectual creativity. Look at him describing Ismail&#39;s arrival in the steamboat to Alexandria after he finished his studies: Why did the ships deliberately make this reluctance to reach, and what was the fastest in separation? Anyone who takes refuge in the arboretum remains a captive of his life. He describes him as Britain and described his girlfriend Mary: The acquaintance has a collision between the two characters, which comes out victorious or loser, the acquaintance has a meeting, and the friendliness is up to the future. He who seeks the morals of angels is overcome by the morals of beasts. These eastern emotions are vicious and hated because they are impractical and unproductive, and if they are stripped of benefit, there remains nothing but their weakness and humiliation. Rather, these emotions have strength in secrecy, not in disclosure. And the human soul does not find its strength and then its happiness unless it separates from the masses and confronts them. As for integration, it is weak and resentful. Here, it describes the poor people, and perhaps it describes all the Arab peoples: What is the benefit of jihad in a country like Egypt and with a people like the Egyptians, who have lived in humiliation for centuries, so taste and taste it? This is an old people and returned to their childhood, if there was someone to lead them, they would have jumped to manhood again in one step. The road is familiar and glory is old, and memories remain. The lover does not measure or compare, and if the comparison is entered from the door and the love passes through the window, here he describes how Ismail reached the stage of conciliation and reconciliation with himself and his community: Where are you, O Light that I have been absent forever? Welcome to you, the blurring of my heart and eyes was gone. I now understood what was hidden from me .. There is no knowledge without faith. He stuck to his knowledge of his spirit and foundation, and left exaggeration in machines and means. He relied on God, then on his knowledge and hands, so God blessed his knowledge and hands. There is not everything in you and me ... there is beauty, secrets, fun and splendor. Al-Saeed is one of her feelings. Then you have to. Between the migration season and the jellyfish. Perhaps Yahya Hakki, son of that neighborhood, did not intend to return to bless those shrines and their oils, but he wanted to convey the idea of reconciling science with faith, the science of the West with the faith of the East, and ended it with a happy, bright ending .. Here comes to our minds the story of the migration season to the north by Tayeb Saleh. It deals with the same idea and revolves its contexts around the same topic and the same way with that young man leaving from the Sudanese village submerged to Britain to study literature to return after the same period of years in Qandil or Hashem and events continue .. but the end of the season

With this satisfied participation, and with this race to harbor and the potential burden. Even to tell that no immigrant landed in Dar Ansari except by lot.

Positive,Positive,"My first experience with Kundera, and certainly not the last, will be with him for other long sessions. His style of the novel is very unique, the way the narration and its overlapping is terrible. He says the novel in one of the passages by Kundera himself: It means that the novel must be unquote. Meaning that they are all integrated. And another point about the difference between the road and the road. On the road, the road itself does not matter, but it is important to get from point A to point B. Or the path is its importance as a path, and the path itself is to be an end. The sense is not just access. This thing summarizes his style with this novel. It does not matter where it begins, how it ends and what will happen. By reading it you will know that every page and perhaps every sentence of its own has value. And this is his view of the art of the novel, it is not like a movie waiting for what will happen, but rather you must feel that for every moment and every page there is something itself and a goal. ... I will definitely have other sessions with Kundera when I devote myself a little

My luxurious sea view room was very impressive, and the housekeepers and reception staff in particular were very pleasant.

It was below average, without luxury decks and with very poor service. My package included bed and breakfast, and I&#39;m mainly talking about breakfast here. Anyway, I tried the food in this restaurant at dinner, and it was very bad. In any case, the Italian food in Mezzaluna was good. My other minor problem was the TV channels. Although they have an acceptable range of channels, I tried to add two MBC MBC Action which are essential in the Middle East, but I could not.

Positive,Positive,"Four dialogues for which Plato Socrates specializes, the dialogues in their entirety are wonderful, evoke the mind and urge him to think, research and ask, all dialogues begin with introductions on the tongue of Socrates and end with either negative results to criticize one of the misconceptions from Socrates ’viewpoint especially Plato or positive to support an idea they believe in .. I like in the introductions that the repeated delivery is very much in the responses of those who are interviewed by Socrates, which appears in the repetition of a group of vocalizations. Examples of yes it is correct. What I might imagine and other amusing signs The full introduction of Socrates’s propositions and in my imagination if there was some objection to these introductions with logical views as it is the Socrates ’style, it could have been the product of the richer dialogues, with the exception of some responses from Simias and Sebaceus in the Phaedo dialogue, so they had some objections that contributed to enriching those The interview a lot .. There are also the introductions that the translator, clever Naguib Mahmoud recounted for each interview separately. I think that it is better to have subsequent comments for each conversation in order not to lose on the reader the pleasure of the interviews themselves .. The Mutafiroun dialogue most of its results are negative to criticize certain ideas about piety and I would have preferred The result of any Abate to define piety in the eyes of Socrates and Plato .. The defense dialogue is better to call it pleading and not the dialogue because Socrates dwells on it in defense of himself and there was no dialogue except in the narrowest limits .. The dialogue of the Qataris I liked and disagreed with it in only one side is when I imagine the laws and blame him for He escaped the death sentence in a hypothetical dialogue in which the laws accused him of treason because he was satisfied with them and accepted them even if he was sentenced after that to flee from their rule, and the difference between me here is that he does not escape from them or from their rule, but if he had accepted to flee then he escapes from the injustice of the applicable law And not from them, how many valid laws are fulfilled Dam from the misuse of its applicants, because the effect of Socrates escaping at the time was not by him from the breach of laws in anything, and this is my opinion. The last dialogue, which is the discussion of Fidon, is the most beloved and most enjoyable of the conversations to myself, as Plato created it on the tongue of Socrates in proving the immortality of the soul, as I liked the idea of a succession of souls on the bodies, according to which the soul after death awaits in the lower world until it is authorized to be chained to the body New, and thus, the one soul rotates over several bodies in many times, and the idea of learning and knowledge in its reality is nothing but a reminder of what the soul has acquired in its first world and in the lower world, it is a truly inspiring idea that made me wonder about what kind of spirit inhabited me who was in the past, and made me Also imagine that spirits It is only a very limited number that alternates and regenerates in the bodies in an endless cycle, and the dialogue also raised the idea of succession of opposites that Plato believed a lot. In the end the book is creamy and worth reading again

Positive,Positive,"Political philosophy is a book in the depth of philosophy, history and civilization that dives between the solid dualism between the foundations of monotheism and polytheism and the loose dualism, even if it did not give it its full right, because it is a theoretical deconstructive book between faith and disbelief. It is a small book. The contemporary reader and Muslim generally feel the importance of the theoretical dismantling effort presented by Al-Masiri in the first part of partial and comprehensive secularism in particular. And pushes the Islamic to search and learn about the branch of ontology or existentialism because it is a philosophy that expresses a gap in the entire Western civilization.

Positive,Positive,"It seems to me from reading the other comments that I am. I did not notice the dimensions of the plot. As others understood it, it seems to me that some did not pick up the primary goal that Mitchell tried to reach .... I will try to clarify this point and what I understand from the book, then I will talk about my impression of the book .. I will start with what I understood; the book basically talks about The philosophy of colonial rule, neither the history of colonial events nor its final outcome, and for this reason the author spoke in the introduction about the philosophies of Jacques Derrida and Michel Vaucault in. This philosophy is based on two principles: the first is a high degree of representation, that is, the use of signs on meanings that are not physically present, for example, the organization of the new European-style neighborhoods in Cairo and Rabat was a symbol of the existence of a precise system, different and separate from the buildings and streets It is the article of the organization itself, and the old neighborhoods have been preserved to symbolize the lack of order, in contrast with the new neighborhoods .. The second basis: It is the principle of permanent control, that everyone be under supervision, without the observation authority being observed or visible. What I see and understand is that these two principles are part of modern systems of government in general, so the introduction of new army systems and forced recruitment The one who started with Muhammad Ali was not a conspiracy but a transfer of the prevailing systems in Europe, as well as education systems and the architecture of cities and villages, and the brutality with which this matter was made was part of this, perhaps forced labor during the era of Muhammad Ali and Ibrahim his son Ziada and Diligence from them .. This is not a justification for these methods in any way, but an attempt to understand the reason behind it, and Muhammad Ali and the workers of Tawfik and the British attempt to transform Egypt to serve its economy were motivated by this approach, so their solution was to transfer the European systems of government with its philosophy .. Follow this of course Attempts to change culture, religion, language, and literature, bad faith cannot be excluded from it, and those who rise up to address this These are attempts, including Mustafa Kamel, who attacked Qasim Amin in the matter of women&#39;s emancipation, despite his conviction of some of the principles of this system, as it appeared in his talk about methods of education .. Attempting to implement this philosophy of government in our country led to the emergence of this collision, so the writer applied the theories of Derrida To clarify the weakness of this philosophy .. This is what I understood from the writer&#39;s intent, and the damage that occurred to Egypt was not only due to the application of this system, except for the impact of the same on Western countries. The system of oppression that we suffer now is partly the result of this philosophy. As for the main reason, it is the fact that the military and the rest of the state in general agree on corruption and injustice, as if it is a religion that has ... As for my impression of the book, it is difficult to define it. The book raised more questions in my mind than answers, and it is a commendable point in it, especially since these questions converged with other questions that I was thinking about the nature of these regulations. Two shortcomings I took on this edition and the book: Despite the quality of the translation to some extent, I found some spelling errors and punctuation, especially in the recent chapters .. Some parts of the book could have been presented in an easier language.

Positive,Positive,"It is unfortunate that the enemies of Islam know its ability and the Muslims do not know it. They knew from the beginning of the call that Islam is an invasive religion of its nature that is rejected only by those with souls, it is a religion consistent with the pure common sense that broke the right and did not contaminate the disease of arrogance .. it is a religion that addresses the human mind and appreciates and respects it. And he seeks the supremacy of the human spirit, which always seeks to find something metaphysical related to it in order to fill the void within it, as he does not distance himself from the fools of Jews and Christians who own nothing of their religion except to convince his adherents that they only have to believe in crucifixion and salvation, otherwise there is no there Something about peace, s Blood for man is a complete system of religion and world, and it always pushes man to ask and research not only to believe in what is said without realizing his mind .. Hence, conspiracies have been woven for him from the first moment in which he commanded his prophet to crack what he commanded and warn his close clan, since the war was fierce ever since. Now and for more than a year, we have witnessed that the war does not end since the invasion of Badr, passing the wars of apostasy, and what the old and modern Crusades were about us far away ... Our religion, and not to our race, are today fighting those who are sons Our skin speaks in our tongues and they condemn our religion, but they are a dagger in the back of Islam. There is no doubt that those who sold themselves to the Crusader and Judaic ambitions brought about I do not say in Islam, but in the Muslims of defeats what the enemies of Islam failed to do for centuries, so we had to face these and our war with them before our battle began With others, the class must first be cleansed before the battle begins ... and the question that is always repeated remains for this hatred of another ???.

Positive,Positive,"After reading a novel, I knew how to master the writing of the novel by mixing the literary and political styles together at the hands of the English writer George Orwell .. a novel that diverges in the depth of advanced societies, rooted in it and in its dictatorial system with an exciting constitutional constitutional template, was able to predict the future future of peoples, the matter What distinguished her among the world’s political narratives .. And if Orwell’s writing was not an interesting pleasure, I would not have fled to his other narrative, which is rich in definition, Animal Farm, because I am not one of those who really love political subjects. And it became clear to me that even if the purpose of the novel is similar to the subject, only each one It is a masterpiece in its own right that does not resemble a mind Other .. Animal Farm. In the content:. Those who read Orwell&#39;s biography and his clear political positions understand exactly as he submits himself that this novel has its satirical purpose, mocking communism and the Stalinist regime that ruined the concept of socialism in Orwell&#39;s opinion. Orwell, who fought Stalin in the atmosphere of World War II, came to describe this situation with a story, let me say, everyone can read and fully absorb it .. A farm that varies in its animals from pigs, dogs, horses, ducks, chickens, etc...the owner of the human is Jones She succeeds in draining it away from the farm, to take control of her own leadership. Between the pig Snowball and the other Napoleon, there are disagreements over the leadership of the farm and the fulfillment of its affairs. The turning point in the story takes place, where Napoleon can defeat Snowball in a violent fight when he feels the latter is victorious over him. This battle was the beginning of Napoleon&#39;s presidency of the farm, which Orwell symbolized Stalin as many critics analyzed .. The farm affairs develop, seven commandments are laid down as laws for them, some battles occur with other farms, all of this until we reach the paper end only, where it explains In short, the revolutionary who once revolted in the name of justice turned into a monster that does not differ from the human race by anything, as there is no difference between what is seen between a pig and a human being ... The end of what we are still under its weight ... It is true that it is by its events and personalities, where the interpretation is prolonged, symbolizing what was before During and after the Stalinist era, as Orwell raged, it was only suitable for any society to be described as a human being. A distinct from Hiwanath ... only feet-two method:. When you read this novel, you come back like a child who loves token stories. Symbolism is a key element of this novel, which, if it lacks some narrative elements, is but it revolves around a certain historical era that was shaped intelligently by Orwell, on a farm of animals. It goes beyond being a short story, with its mark and sarcasm, to a hybrid world, in which the donkey obeys and does not speak to any defeated person, the loyal horse who works hard without knowing what is happening, the protected dog that represents the police of power, and the pig itself i.e. the power made by the people She pounced on him in the name of freedom ... a favorite.

Positive,Positive,"Beautiful, it ended in record time, like all of Noor&#39;s novels. But this time, as far as I am concerned, the novel ended with the death of dreams. Or do you think that what is meant is that dreams sometimes die but can be replaced by another method? Even if this was intended, then everything I read after her death did not concern me at all, and I did not mean to reduce the effort of the author at all, so there must have been an end to the novel, and I have succeeded completely in writing this end, which some may see a happy ending. Yes, it is a happy ending to Jabr and Mary, after all their suffering. Until I wrote that suddenly appeared on the scene, I took a share of that happiness, even if it was not complete. As for Yassin, the handsome and rich doctor who loved sincerely and sincerely, he made me cry with his message of dreams that I read in public in appreciation of her or in appreciation of what was between them. Sorry, I did not dream of dreams, I pity her a lot until the moment of her death when I told Gabr that it was from her scent .. She did not tell him my daughter or daughter or even Yassin&#39;s daughter. Just an orphaned girl who smells who I love. Algebra is one of the characters that we only see between the two heads of a book, so where is the man who marries someone whom she does not love, who tolerates her wailing and depression and raises her child who is from another man. Where is the man who loves in this way? . Also, we will not see it in our real world. We will not see this woman who would like her daughter to be called her husband&#39;s sweetheart. And smile.

Positive,Positive,"An exciting novel, as usual, Ala Al-Aswany .. I did not miss a moment and I read it. It is not a pure historical novel ... even though this was my belief when I heard about the historical period about which you are talking. Honestly ... I do not think it takes him five years, according to what is written behind .. Although the people you are talking about are theoretically impossible to answer any documented information they were living with what and not the details of their lives with the magnificence that Dr. / Alaa wrote. The narrative plot was weaker than the previous two novels, the architecture of Jacobian and Chicago ... I had imagined that all people would relate to more than that on the last novel, as he did with an unparalleled genius in Chicago. May I say that the dose of sex was in excess of the need ... but no ... sincere ... for me this is a normal thing ... without hypocrisy and frankly sex and especially stayed in Egypt actually constitutes events and represents a part and a terrible factor in The lives of the Egyptians. However, he stated in the novel that he provided the dose of enjoying the novel and its events and let the one read it, and he is amused especially that many of it are related to the cam of Qafsheya and a special story when I come to Aisha&#39;s biography ... However, Alaa Al-Aswany thought he was intentional and basically he was speaking On him again, we will also speak on it, as well as a line .. This was generally more polite and less shocking than the previous two novels ... especially, and we know that this period was a period in which this talk will happen .. this is not a period far away from us in Time, which gives it a separation from us in a way ... as if we are watching the things that happen, not part of the written reality. The genius of the novel in two needs:. The first thing is to choose the main topic and heroes. This novel talks about the invisible people ... as one of us when he was watching the images of Faruq and not the era in general, he focused on the image of the Aswan man and not the Nubian who stands to serve the people de ... we are all attributed and commented on the distinction of Faruq. .. The beauty of the princesses ... the confusion ... the personalities and relationships ... the sessions ... the decoration even and the inanimate objects were more important to us than we do not see them as countries ... even though the countries of our ancestors and our relatives ... the countries of the true Egyptians .. Countries of most of the Egyptian people ... countries of scavengers and delivery workers who are sitting on the coffees day and night and those who are confident in the lines of living and the good children who are in the college I did not marginalize the owners and put them on, it is not like that ....... The people who do not appear under the sun ... The people who live in the faces of the walls ... The people that you feel are not in society ... The Murlock who spoke to Wales in a wonderful machine Time. These people are the backbone of any society ... The people who do not struggle to fear and know them will meet another world ... all vital, sincerity, concerns and feelings .. a real world in which real people live, not fake by a little money, parties, shows, Arab and Brides have a game and a little zombie, they move and act like a place ... the world that Metsi knew of his interference and was amazed by it and decided that she sacrifices everything needed so that it remains one of him despite the external form that asphalt. He concluded, but the novel and a very hard copy of the image that was righteous ... which I think you did not focus on in the first place when I came to buy the novel .. Or it can be felt that it is a picture of a closed or not this way .... countries of the protagonists .. countries that strike each day In the end, if you mistake it or not, it is wrong, for justice, and I hope that they will not be like the mind of the people ... The countries that exist are not living. Those living are not living ... insects who respond from all of Egypt to suck their blood, and when they die, they are in a million others. ... the people who didn’t hope ... The six envisioned countries are Abdoun, Hassanein, Karara, Bahr, Abdel Aziz, Mahmoud, Samahi and others ... who we did not like We see them other than when Dr. Alaa and Rana people are really in this novel. The second point: This is a strange perspective about the novel, and I will read it to me. Man is by nature a primitive being ... instinctively ... originally like any animal ... Originally instincts are the primary motivation in animals ... and this is not an insult ... this is a fact ... instincts are a grain of hormones that are excreted in us as they do not excrete at any An animal ... lust, fear, hunger, and thirst ... It is true that the difference is that I have a mind of mind: whoever restrains the animal being led and our case is intended instincts and costly and free because this is the length of history in a cultural and moral class that is ours We will avoid this with our instincts, because we do not discuss animals ... a class that remains to be formed with our experiences ... with the collective mentality of human beings over time ... from religions and literature and He sees it ... it is the class that we work with people ... I can&#39;t tell a mask that in fact it is not a mask ... this is supposed to be left with us being a human being and a human being ... it is the layer that we say we are supposed to do what we do and what we do in situations .. is what determines our behavior based on our social position, etc. But no matter how thick the layer is, this is the atmosphere for each one of us ... except that our subconscious mind is not a penny, it is the origin in us, it is a grain of chemicals, our life, we will not be able to get rid of it, no matter how much we try, and no matter how sophisticated ... ... whether with all rudeness, like what they used to do with Mahmoud and Fawzi in the novel, and like what I did not work with the girls who slept with them ... whether by finding justifications such as what he did Karara and Hassan when they went to the ko, so that the beating will return again in exchange for it Tipping back. Whether in circumstances that pass by our superiority ... like what was full and Abdoun hours they spent with the Koo and Mister Wright in every call, although this was not what anyone imagined. I was asked by real feelings of contradicting custom, which people settled on, like the opinions of the Egyptians, and the love of Metsi for the whole .... and this was what I was talking about, that the sex in the novel was employed from this perspective ... I know you are just any good community .. You will find the richest and most aristocratic classes by interfering and interacting with the lowest class in society with the image of your age what you imagined .. and what more picture will shock you other than sex, Alaa can explain it in the story .... instincts are a main engine in people&#39;s behavior ... interactions and results The one who appears on her with the strangest aspiration of the results of changing the course of any nation .. Think of burning my dear to himself and not what, except for Hitler, remains Hitler .. Q I was talking about Er. In the end ... the Automobile Club is not better than the Yaqoubian Building and not Chicago ... My relationship with it is not so much because it happened in a relatively long period ... The political projection if it means means to the one with a tiger there is not clear to me ... People are not drawn like I did not get used to Alaa Al-Aswany ... but in general I enjoyed her very much. And oh right ... the first thing in the first place is that the characters of the novel are out of it ... and Karl Benz&#39;s time is not surprising. I can say that Karl Benz’s time appears to be an important part of the novel, which is that the six are always a key driver in any event .. whether by her will or whether by attracting the man to her, she has the same idea of instincts as Brdo, and that this changes the course of any need ... but if it is his intention actually ... the novel remains a major aspect of its focus on one subject ... the point where writings are written and a complete literary aspect is adopted on it and a flaw originally comes as a sub-topic in a novel. The first part is for science fiction. I forgot to talk about it originally from the many pieces of what is strange and separate from the novel .. I do not know he was trying out a new need or what

It will warmly welcome you, give you complete personal care, fulfill all your requests and provide you with any information you want about this extraordinary island. Accomodation in the magnificent, distinctive caves is first class: comfortable beds, well-equipped kitchen and shower room. Everything has great touches, and the cleanliness is a skilled maid who comes every day to change the covers and clean carefully. The best time is when sitting on the balcony amid beautifully cared for flowers, looking at the amazing volcanic landmark and watching the cliffs change to pink as the sun sets. In fact it is so special that you may leave the beach early to return to the charm of your balcony. There are hundreds of steps of stairs going down and then going up again, and breakfast is not served with such a good kitchen, who would need it? There is no swimming pool with the Aegean Sea that surrounds you, who needs it too. If any of these matters cause you, you will not be able to enjoy the magic of Ares Caves. But you will be the loser. Additional tip: You will be encouraged to take a trip to the local volcano. The boat trip around the volcanic landmark is wonderful, but the volcano itself is a disappointment. You have to take a steep path for half an hour in the heat, and then search for some brown stones. There is no swimming pool with steam bubbles, not even any trace of smoke. You have to wait for Iceland or New Zealand to arrive

Positive,Positive,"Despite so many pictures, there are martyrs they have never been photographed. Their only picture is taken after death. She wept because some of the pictures were not like them, because their faces were deformed by bullets and shrapnel, and by death. . What compels us to sing at the funerals of our martyrs is the one who killed them, we sing even to make him feel the moment that he defeated us and if we lived I will remind you that we will cry a lot after we are liberated ...

Positive,Positive,"Of the novels that dazzle you, arouse your enthusiasm, and thinks that it is the best that you have read, but once you close it and with only one day passing by reading it you forget .. but few are the stories that make you stand in front of it amazed, stunned, make you think, change, change your perception of all things around you. You are raised to the top to see the foundations of the highest, purest and purest selves, to see the truth clearly and clearly. You see rampant mold in everything around you, shocked by the fact that the mold comes not only from those around you, but also from within you. Some of the novels are what you can express our feelings: joy, sadness, crying, fear, hope .. You feel it while reading it, so that you can touch it inside you, make yourself confused while you cry with heroes, laugh with them and grieve with them. But few are the stories that frighten you. It is not the horror you feel when reading novels by Stephen King or Adgar Alan Poe. Or what you feel while reading any novel that talks about ghosts and werewolves. Rather, it is your horror while reading a symbolic philosophical novel. The horror that causes you to fear the same fate is what befell the protagonists. After every page, you are afraid to lose your sight or drown in that milky river as the author described it. Sarmago terrified me. The length of my reading of the novel and my eyes are wide open, perhaps due to the ugliness of events, or perhaps it is an instinctive movement for fear of meeting the same fate. How did he manage this suffering and tragedy with this creativity? How to plot plot and events, make you see them in front of you, and live inside them. The novel demonstrated the human nature of man, making him lose only one of his senses, to reveal his instincts, animal nature, and selfishness. He is going wandering on his face, without organization, his first and last concern is to satisfy his instincts. And if he has some power, his second concern is power and control. Was it strange that this woman was the only one who did not lose sight? How can an epidemic approach an angel like her, an angel who feels his responsibility and duty is to help those others who cannot help themselves. You don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re being helped or helped, but rather it&#39;s the call of duty. It is the reason why her eyes remained healthy for him. Like a mother who holds the hand of her child to love without falling down, hold your hand to guide you, so that your eyes are no longer able to see. Like a mother who cleans her baby without disgusting or regretted, she cleanses you of all that is attached to you from the fouling of quarries. Like a mother who roars when the danger approaches her children, she is killed if it is the only option to defend her group ... Like a mother who still feels the responsibility towards her children even after they grow up, she still feels her responsibility towards her group, her protection and feeding ... how a pandemic like this to approach From the mass of tenderness, courage and giving like her? His description of city life by the black gangster terrified me. Such an epidemic may reveal the dirty side of the human being, and it may turn a city upside down. He might return it to the first primitive ... His description of their condition without water and food made me wonder, How did the first humans live? It seems easy to get used to the difficulty of life when you find it as it is, but after you and your body get used to progress and technology, it is difficult for you to deal with nature alone. You cannot wait for rain, do not eat flowers and tree leaves, nor search for water wells and cavities. It becomes impossible for you to deal with nature face to face without stages separating you. Tired but after I finished reading it, I feel that I have become more visionary than before; perhaps it is the insight that Sarmago makes you realize and takes your hand to make you touch it inside you, or maybe it is only an appreciation of these eyes, after what you saw from the scourge of blindness. I don’t know exactly, but all I realize is that it changed something internal .. creativity is embodied in words. Done

Positive,Positive,"A book that made me confused about my confusion, does a person spend his life day after day, or stands up to build a decent life, either a decent life or death, writes the planets as if he lives between us and witnesses our condition, I wonder how he drew that picture in the last century, I see him what he would do if he was living now and witnessing All of this tyranny, and how do young people lose their vigor and determination day after day as they face this sweeping flow of thieves who are free in broad daylight? See what he would do. He sees us submissive, deprived of pride and dignity like this .. In my view, I see the first and most important reason for complacency and despotism is education, education in its three main aspects moral education, religious education and scientific education, the fall of education led to individuals accepting submission to other than God, contentment with humiliation for life, This is because they do not understand freedom and appreciate its value, so how do you ask a bird that has been trapped in the cage since its inception to fly and fly in the sky until it opens the door to the cage in front of it, that he does not know how to fly and does not realize his pleasure and the beauty of flying away from the cage and so man, he lost some basic values that raised him to submit And the millet He was satisfied with it until he became palatable .. As for the solutions that he presented, some agreed, and some did not. The most severe thing I agree with is the presence of an alternative solution, otherwise we fall into another tyranny in a new form and a different color, but in the end it is also darkness, but I disagree with him that the solution must be from time Soft and this is what differed in it. When he found the alternative solution, he must confront tyranny with full force, determination and decisiveness. The people of the oppressors must be cut off ... In general, a wonderful book that helps you reflect on the negligence in which we live as a nation, as groups and as individuals.

She was not sure yet that Rashid had rightly become her husband. They are humans just like us.

There is no return of Jesus to the Philippines and his surrender, even though he has the right to enjoy living in Kuwait, being materially better than the Philippines like any Kuwaiti, but this thing won the novel a lot of realism ...

A tightly written novel, sketch and description with interest for the characters. But the empty filling and narration was more than the core of the events. In his novel, he retaliated against the ruling regime, but in a way that would not cross the mind of the length of the novel. Through the brother-in-law of the president&#39;s son, it is a really great loophole. I liked some of Mawlana Hatim Al-Shinnawi&#39;s propaganda terms and as elders they say they are peelings of religion, that is, its surface. They do not say its depth because they do not find anyone who understands it or funds it for the media, but the scales are funded. Of course, I will not judge my disagreement or my agreement with him on any religious matters, because they are based on fake characters. The bottom line is that the novel defects it in its literary judgments, narration style, and dialogue are colloquial Ali Foshi.

Positive,Positive,"I was in the process of collecting my thoughts and final observations about the novel, when I got to the last pages, and if Dostoevsky surprised me with these lines in which he responded to the words that began gathering themselves to confront him, he wrote: I admit that I do not wish to be a novelist depicting a hero who is a member of a family coincidentally an effort without fruit and beauty. These models are still from the current life in any case, so they cannot be complete with aesthetic. How can the writer avoid errors, exaggerations and omissions here? It will be for the writer or reader to guess and go overboard with guessing what remains for a writer who does not want to be limited to historical narratives .. Rather, it dominates the desire to write about what is current reality? To guess and .. to make mistakes. . Similar names are a basic problem in the novel, where I had to stop and check for sure about any character who was speaking, my first reading of Dostoyevsky, an intimate novelist, speaking from within the characters of his novel, from the heart of her fears and dreams, we approach through him to man, and the teenage novel is only a long reflection on This strange creature .. Quotes :. Neither do you know what to do, nor do I know what to do, when the Russian, when he went out of the way for which the habit was drawn, did not know what to do. On the road, everything is clear: income, rank, status in society, vehicle, visits, position, woman. What remains of me at the first deviation from the paved road? A paper winded by the wind, I don&#39;t know what to do. I tried in these two months to stay in the drawn road, and I wanted to love the drawn road, and I dug into this drawn road. . It is an interesting and interesting thing to see what the views of the high society people feel about each other, and on what basis they respect each other. . Why is life so short this whole palace? Most probably, the goal of shortening it is not to be boring, because life is also an artwork of the works of the Greatest Creator, drafted in complete final form as a poem by Pushkin. Brevity is the first condition of art. But those who are not bored should be allowed to live longer. . Simplicity, dear, simplicity is the most cunning. . He has a wide mind, but his heart is worried. . But this love that the strong holds for the weak is sometimes much more violent and painful than the love between two equal, because the strong bear the responsibility of his weak friend despite his will. . A person cannot live without prostration. Without prostration, man cannot bear himself. . How could all the feelings of peace and the joys of the armistice all combine with the beating of my dying, unruly, painful, delicious pain, and with the appalling stormy decisions that I intend to make? I do not know. . Laughter. Atheism. Suicide. Suicide is the biggest sin of a person. But the Lord is the only ruler, because He alone knows everything, standards and limits. It is our duty to pray to God for the examples of these great sinners. If you have heard of such a sin as this sin, pray to its confused supplication before you sleep, and intercede with the Lord even if you do not know him, and if you do not know him, your intercession will be more beneficial as well. . But are they many of those who stand and persist in caring for others ’happiness? If the money is not a god, then it is half a deity. . A lock in theories and utter ignorance of life. . Sadness mixes with joy whenever years pass, then it becomes impossible for a happy exhale. This is how things happen in this world: every soul is tested and comforted. . A human being is a device that informs of the complexity that a person cannot understand anything, especially if this person is a woman. . But it seems to me that when a person has a large part of culture, he cannot express his victorious victorious happiness. . Russian women come down to them quickly, and their beauty expires. . As if this human being had surprised her by a fixed idea, so she was very tormented because she is beyond her powers. . Their weapon was always logic. Where logic is, boredom. . So, humans realize that they are completely alone, and suddenly they feel abandoned orphaned. . To tighten what they will hasten to love, in order to suffocate the great sadness in their hearts. . My friend, I suddenly felt that serving the idea never absolved me, as an ethical and sane person, from the happiness of at least one human being during my life, practical happiness. . The educated, superior person who seeks a supreme idea turns his back on daily life sometimes, so he becomes ridiculous and funny, becomes freaky, becomes cool, and I even say frankly that he becomes stupid, in practical life of course. . All that he possessed of freedom had disappeared at once when that meeting was, and the man found himself forever drawn to a woman who had nothing in common between her. . Your whole culture and culture has cost you torture and fights that you have fought throughout your life, but it has received perfection for free. This is not equal in anything. This is what arouses frustration in women. . You have a tough soul, the same woman. Mama was demolished a demolition. . One can speak with words what he wants, and indicate with words anything. As for deciding, legislating, and implementing .. this needs special printing and strong grievance. I marry him because I will be quieter with him than I am with another. Then keep myself whole for me. . There is no doubt that I abuse you. This is a severe fancy flaw. One thing I know is that if I was with you I had finished, and if I was absent from you I would have finished too. As long as I am with you and without you, you are always with me wherever you are. I know that I can hate you more than I can love you ... This naive and humiliating hope awakens compassion in the soul and stabs the heart with a strong stab with enough frankness and the impossibility of it. . All the features of her face were distorted by pain. . However, what matters to us more than anything else is that we finally have a system, whatever this system is, provided that it is a system for us that is hope, and that is comfort if you will. Something that is finally completed, not this eternal undermining, and these cacophony flying all over the place, and this waste and this dirt from which nothing comes out for nearly two hundred years. .

Positive,Positive,"This is a great hotel, but there are still some remarks this year that we went back to the Hotel des Cascades. It is still a great hotel but we had some minor problems. The comprehensive menu was ok but there was a limited amount of drinks to choose from and only local drinks were included. We would be grateful if more wine selections are available. We had hoped for some development as we were returning visitors we had visited this place before. We got a room with a beautiful view of the Red Sea. The golf courses were in good condition, however the vet was not deep enough and needed some attention. One day, unfortunately, the stadium was crowded with too many players, so we had to wait over a minute after our time to start. The break took more than hours and this is a very long time. In the middle of the week a large group of local residents came to the hotel. This has greatly affected the general atmosphere. The hotel was not prepared to entertain children and most guests came to play golf and enjoy a quiet day at the pool. But with this large group it was not possible to calm the afternoon at the pool. Finally, I would like to ask the administration to prevent smoking in the Eagle&#39;s Bar, smoking in this bar created a bad public atmosphere and made our clothes smell of smoke.

Positive,Positive,"If you want to know the state of the Palestinian woman, you must use this narration. You will surely live in her airspace moment by moment. She will laugh sometimes and cry sometimes, so that she knows that life on this earth is a gift and an ordeal .... The novel spoke about Magida&#39;s suffering upon her marriage to Ismael Ibn Ibn Jenin camp, The intensity of the pain that she felt was from the Palestinians of Jordan, where the bridge, search, torture, humiliation and all forms of torment are found there .. The events of the novel move us from the marriage of Magda and Ismail to the burning of the Al-Aqsa Intifada after the criminal Ariel Sharon defiled it and the response of the Palestinian street With calls for resistance and response to the crimes of the occupier, he went out For an entire people, including men and women, old and young, with marches that roamed the entire Palestinian cities, and it was necessary to sacrifice the soul and the money and all that we have, so the martyr rose and many were injured and the houses were destroyed on their residents and the money and properties were confiscated and the people were not left Except God. During the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Magda was in the last months of her pregnancy, and, God willing, she would lose her fetus, Nour, as a result of exposure to a young woman in a university march, and of course she was hiding the news of her pregnancy from her husband, as she was not meeting very often, because of the nature of his work as a nurse and resistance at the same time .. she rolled Days and every day, the siege and restrictions on camp residents are increased in order to search for resistance fighters by the authority of Oslo and the Zionist occupation, until the massacre of the Jenin camp took place and many camp residents were martyred, homes were destroyed, and everyone threatened to kill, what was from the people The camp except to flee to their relatives outside the camp, and there Magda met Ishmael and Lall He has to be a mother of two children who are hope and light .. The longing in the hearts of the fans increases whenever their rows inflame the torments of separation, so was Magda’s condition, so her husband now can no longer visit and see his children, he is one of the wanted people for the authority and the occupation army, and if he must From a conversation between the spouses, the messages placed at the grave of their child Nour are the solution, as Ismail sealed it with the number of Zionists who were killed .... Undoubtedly, the husband’s absence left the great void in his family, so Magda decided to join one of the media agencies in order to spread the suffering Prisoners and the people, as soon as Magda became famous and her writings began, the authorities and the occupation began to pledge He was killed or arrested, and she was actually arrested for six months and then deported to Amman. There, she did not remain idle but continued her media work and opened an institution that manages the affairs of Palestinian women .... One morning, the tragic news to her was that her husband was besieged and He was arrested by the occupation forces, to become a hostage to them, the days passed and no one met with another, and despair crept for everyone that there is no freedom after today, but God is against the resistance by kidnapping an Israeli soldier to become a bargain with the occupation, where the condition of the resistance was to launch He was released in exchange for a prisoner from various organizations, and Ismail was scheduled to be released, as C. When he deported him to Gaza, his family prepared to travel to Gaza to receive her resisting son after a severe absence and a longing, to set foot in the land of Gaza and bless the hands of those who were credited with his release, to embrace the husband and children, the breath of air, sunlight, and everything in Gaza .. This is how the novel ended with seeing light and hope in the face of God Almighty, and this is what every prisoner in his prison demands, and I ask God Almighty to hasten relief for our leader Abdullah Al-Barghouthi, the owner of this narration, as he is in dire need of light and hope in his life, to complete what remains of Life .

Positive,Positive,"Before going into the details of the novel, I would like to point out that the events mentioned in this novel are not suitable for small age groups, people with weak seals, and those with sensitive equipment ... The novel was named after the Impaler, according to Vlad Dracula, and to the state of Laashia, one of the European provinces that was affected by the Ottoman tide ... Dracula, the bitterness of shame and disgrace, and subjected to the Ottoman tutelage against his will, which made him decide to rebel against Muhammad al-Fatih, the Ottoman governor and take revenge on the Boyars ’group of traders of Saxon origin who ruled in the state of Laashia and revolutionized Father Dracul at the instigation of the King of Hungary and spared no effort in punishing his people and anyone Its relationship in any way with the Puyars or the Turks who were present at the time in Bucharest and Turkiche, the capital of the impaler .. What is noticeable is that the name impaled was not in vain for the son Dracula, but applied with his letters to him .. It was that the foolish monster was penetrating a column whose end was flat on the back of the person, a man who was Or a woman until he settles inside by the amount of two fists and then raises it on a wooden pillar and remains suspended like this until death; that depends on the path the column goes through. Either he reaches his heart or until he comes out from between his eyes .. It was said that those boys were eating his food between the trunks of suspended trees. Individuals had a delight in watching together He accused and their slow death .. The brutality of that crazed did not stop there but rather it was said that he was filling pots of up to five people with water or oil and leaving holes in the mouth to the heads and burning the fire underneath and coming with his old drink and he was afraid to watch the screams of people while they were ripening on the fire .. It was also said that he built A castle for him called Bunary, a distance of a thousand and five hundred degrees from the earth, a ladder dug by the Boyars, who gave them the chance to live by running through the piles .. He tormented a group of Roma whose homelands have children and were ripped and matured of the best of them and ordered the rest to eat their brothers and subject them to him and his rule ... It is said that Vlad Dracula He was killed in his prison in Hungary upon the recommendation of Muhammad Alfa The governor of Al-Othmani after he escaped from Laashia and was betrayed by his brother Radu and followed the Ottoman rule ..... The novel speaks in its entirety about the myth of the return of the spirit of Dracula. Killed in his bathroom and broken from his neck as if he was a bite of a bite .. He also avenges his killers and the Ottomans .. When the myth of the return of the impaler and spread of fear spread throughout the Ottoman Empire, Muhammad al-Fateh decided to send an envoy called Orhan Effendi to refute that myth and spread the tyranny in the hearts of people .. begins The novel is the journey of Orhan Effendi to Bukhar Six and paradoxes and events continue to become clear in the end that the one who commits crimes in the name of the spirit of Vlad Dracula and has Micah and Michael who decided to avenge their father ... Lessons learned from this novel:. If someone wrongs in the right of someone, apologize to him immediately and before it is too late, because he may leave and you will not be able to apologize to him at all. Do not trust a beautiful woman who seduces you and lures you to your death. You have to suspect the least likely person to commit a heinous crime ... as a poor servant, for example. Trust completely in what reason and logic say, and follow their rules with hidden intelligence, because perhaps logic of despotism becomes one of the most important reasons for reason and general safety. Exposed intelligence inevitably leads to serious consequences. Do not cast your mistakes on the devil, who has no energy except by whispering to you .. For your mistakes are borne by the evil emirate first. Finally, it struck me strongly that all the horrific crimes committed in history against humanity adhered to religious beliefs .. I do not think that religion is absolutely related to inhumanity .. I do not know whether it makes sense for me to send a message to those who use religion as a cover for his brutality that he not only offends himself but also religion ... but I I send a message to people not to believe that any religion is linked to bloodshed ... because the sky is shaking with blood. The novel is really fun despite its miserable end and when you hold it you will not put it before you finish it

The novel is divided into three lives, the first is the month of wedding, the second is the shock of the desert, and the third is the mother of the boys. The protagonist is slowed down, and the first life says of him: As he takes the cup from the trembling hands, he says in a low voice: Thank you, Aunt. I wished for a moment with a dreamy heart, if it was he who came to address me .. but he was not, he was my brother, my younger sermon than him, who called them the writer; because he writes to them the contracts of trade, and he is called there Nabati even though they are all Nabat, and he who will teach me in a later life, hidden The words of the Arabs and the secrets of touching the meanings with words .. It is from a line called the cover of the novel is the hero, but when we see it only a little. With one double-sided God, and with eternal truth, I say the truth. There is only a son and a mother in the universe, where every mother and son are in them. The son Ishtiaq and the mother bosom. And they have birthing and birth. El-Lat, the essence of all beings and the origin of the hourly images. Inactive in the womb is safe, and all dormant. Do not listen to those who underestimate and rise up, then Han, true to mankind. It is time for my two-sided appearance to come. The Nabati Prophet. With these words the words of the hero started. The events of this novel take place in the seventh century AD, where wars were grinding between the Persians and the Romans, and between the emergence of prophets, including the Prophet Qureshi Muhammad the Messenger of God, and how the Arabs became a military and pivotal power. Egypt, and talks about the Christianity, and there was a slight rescue of Christianity, and after that Maria marries an Arab husband from the Nabataeans ... who are the Nabataeans? They are Arabs who lived in Egypt, Iraq and the Levant by Islam and Christianity. Where did this name come from? The name is more likely to be derived from the distinctive characteristic of this huge ancient group. It is an attribute that distinguished them from the rest of the Arabs, as they were able to extract water from the arid desert. This is the popular opinion, but the fact is that the Nabataeans were skilled in engineering the collection of water that rarely descends with torrents. This narration tells an important time period in the history of Egypt ,,. Including: the ten years of the Persians ’occupation of Egypt and the strong Arab presence in the Levant and Iraq before the emergence of Islam, and like the long Turkines that preceded the coming of Amr bin Al-Aas to take over the affairs of Egypt and many related myths. But the novel presented all of this according to the context of the events, and according to Maria, whose name became Maoist, after she got married to this Nabati merchant .. The first life ends with a marital marriage and the second life begins, which is a journey through the Sinai desert, this life was not very important, but the last life or The boys describe the customs of the Arabs in marriage, describe some events, and describe the era of the many prophets in them, especially the Nabati. The only comment that we hear from the Nabati about Islam was when they brought him a copy of the Qur’an, so he looked at it long, and he looked at the distant plains, and then he said, as if talking Himself: brings this, blood coming? Many of the Nabataeans entered Islam, and the Jews and the Nabataeans were expelled except Egypt, to pave the way for the conquest of Egypt ... Nabati remained alone in his homes ... and the end of the tongue was the Coptic Maoism. Do they overlook them, and they are already heedless. So I return to him to stay with him. And together we die. Then we are born again ... these two?

Positive,Positive,"This religion and the future of this religion are two valuable books for the martyr Sayyid Qutb, during which he presents focal points dealing with important pillars on which the great Islamic religion is based. Many people have forgotten about it, forgotten by others and ignored others. The most prominent of them in this book is the concept of Islam as a method for human beings and in it the writer shows the nature of Islam’s work in life and how it is on Although it is a divine approach that depends in its mechanism and results on human efforts, it is a dynamic religion that pushes towards work, movement and construction. It urges its followers to take reasons that motivate them to plow and sow on watering and caring for hard work and effort in order to reap the fruits .. It is the religion of instinct, the religion of logic is God’s law. Here, Mr. says: Some people expect from this religion as long as it is a home from God to work in the lives of people in a magical supernatural mysterious reasons and without any consideration for the nature of humans and their innate energies and their material reality at any stage of their development and in any environment of their environment. . He adds: This divine approach, which Islam represents in its final form, as stated by Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, is not achieved in the earth and in the world of people. Once it comes down from God, it is not achieved by a word. Be divine directly the moment you download it. And it is not achieved by simply communicating it to people and clarifying it, nor by divine oppression in the manner that its law passes through the course of astronomy and the functioning of the planets .. Rather it is achieved by carrying a group of people who fully believe in it and uphold it according to its energy and strive to achieve it in the hearts of others and in their lives as well and strive to this end with all that Owns. . It also shows the effect of that human effort on life and the soul, and he says: It is evident that leaving the divine approach to human endeavor to achieve it within the limits of human energy is good for human souls and good for human life .. We say this not to explain the will of God Almighty in making an order about what He has made but let us record only a realistic observation of the effects of this will in the lives of worshipers. . Then the writer turns to other aspects of the topic to present concepts and other characteristics of that approach, such as uniqueness, facilitation and influence, indicating each of them separately. Then he concludes with several Islamic principles and concepts that, in his opinion, caused a radical change in the concepts of nations and peoples, and it was a revolution in the full sense of the word that went beyond the borders of Muslim societies to spread all mankind and color the civilizations with their unique ideas. Which:. One humanity: liberation for the first time from the concept of national nationalism, ethnic, tribal, color, sexual, etc., and the trend towards human unity .. Almighty says: O people, we created you from a male and a female and made you people and tribes to know that if I honor you with God, I fear you, God is knowing an expert. . Great truth of God. . Generous humanity: Islam made human dignity derived from its own humanity, not from any other offer such as gender, color, class, wealth ..... etc .. The Almighty said :. We have honored the children of Adam, carried them on land and sea, provided them with good things, and preferred them over many of those who created us a preference. And when we said to the angels, bow down to Adam, and worship only Satan, my father, and he was proud, and he was one of the disbelievers. .... Great truth of God. . One Nation: Making Islam from a faith is a supporter of gathering, because belief is the most generous characteristic of the human spirit. The Almighty said: This is your nation, one nation, and I am your Lord, so worship. . Edema and creation: Islam established the foundations of morality in society and established systems and legislated for it and made it a basis in all dealings and made it a philosophy and etiquette even in times of wars and battles .. The Almighty says: And fulfill the covenant of God if you pledge and do not deny faith after its affirmation and you have made God a guarantor for you if God knows what you are doing, and you will not be like the one whose void has been revoked after the power of Ankatha. You take your faith as an income between you. To be a nation that is more of a nation than God. . Here are some beautiful quotes from wonderful passages mentioned in the book: Human instinct in its origin is consistent with the law of the universe .. When a person departs with his life system from that law, he not only collides with the vast universe, but also collides with his instinct that is between his sides, and he suffers, is torn, confused, anxious, and lives as humanity lives today in the torment of unhappiness despite all the scientific victories. And all material cultural facilities. . It is not true, starting with the fact that this divine approach costs the human psyche a more difficult effort than to tolerate it or to become long on it .. It is a truly noble approach, but at the same time it is an innate approach that depends on the balance of instinct and spends this balance. And its advantage is that he knows his way from the first moment to this balance. He knows his way to the human soul from the first touch. He knows her paths and curves, and he gently tramples her; he knows her entrances and exits, and he walks up to her in an upright manner and knows her powers and abilities, so he never exceeds her; she knows her needs and longings and meets her completely; and she knows her original builder energies, then he releases it to work and build. When Islam first confronted mankind, it faced this reality with the balance of instinct alone. The balance of instinct was with this debt; despite the long generations that passed and accumulated over the ruins of the broad pre-Islamic reality .. But the instinct of instinct was stronger than all of that aggregate; and the response of instinct was sufficient to shake that aggregate. . God has imposed jihad on believers not to hate people to convert to Islam but to establish on the earth his just, upright and just order that people choose their faith that they love under this system that includes both Muslim and non-Muslims in complete justice. The Almighty says: There is no compulsion in religion, adulthood has emerged from the abolition, so whoever disbelieves the tyrant and believes in God, you have adhered to the trustworthy loop, which is inseparable, and God is All-Knowing ...

Positive,Positive,"This book examines the underdevelopment resulting from the emergence of the phenomenon of the newly independent countries, which is called the third world .. It is known that there are many previous studies and studies on underdevelopment, but these studies have taken economic, industrial and sometimes social perspectives without examining the study of the underdeveloped human condition .. This book is so A type of entrance to the psychology of underdevelopment, which is an attempt based on observation and psychological and social analysis of the phenomena experienced by the oppressed person, an attempt that is not intended to reach final results but rather to contribute to the results that complement the social and economic studies of this phenomenon .. The human being of these societies was not seen as an essential element in any study whatsoever, so the author intended to put things in their proper framework by studying this category and analyzing its properties and knowing its structure and dynamism .. This book is a study of the psychology of the underdeveloped person, as the psychology of underdevelopment in human terms is the same psychological The oppressed human being is under the rule of oppression imposed on him who holds the reins of power .. The writer also worked on overcoming the superficiality that overshadowed the studies of development scholars on the reality of underdevelopment and tried to prove that the underdeveloped person stands as an obstacle in the face of changing the backward social structure due to the suspicion Tahama with his psychological structure .. The writer started the first section of the book with the psychological features of the underdeveloped presence by identifying and defining the retardation and put forward the theories of retardation represented by the superficial method in the study of retardation and a social and other economic method that attributes the cause of retardation to industrial and technical retardation and structural economic retardation and then presents the psychological perspective of retardation and its psychological characteristics and the most important These characteristics are oppression where a person goes through three stages: The stage of oppression and submission resulting from the complexes of deficiency, shame and disorder of permanence. The stage of persecution. The stage of rebellion and confrontation. After studying these characteristics, it is necessary to study the retarded mentality and its systematic mental characteristics, which suffer from the disorder of methodology of thinking and the limitations of dialectical reasoning. The writer attributed the mental retardation to two factors: education policy, mental retardation, relations of domination, subjugation, and mental retardation ... The author ends this section by studying the unconscious life of the oppressed person Its unconscious dynamics, that is, the hidden and driving factors of underdevelopment: The relationship of authoritarianism and subjugation of cataract and resulting in anxiety of the castration. Nature impinges on the image of the bad mother and leads to anxiety of abandonment. And underneath these coats of human being subjugated, defensive methods must be used in an unsuccessful attempt to get rid of the position of injustice. This is what the author presented in the second section, where he spoke about the four most important defensive methods, namely: Self-sufficiency. Either by sticking to the past and returning to the glorious past. Or thawing in the group and returning to the clan family, as he finds refuge in him from some of his responsibilities. Or even relying on others. Identification by the ruler. Identification by authoritarian identification with identification of his flesh, aggression, values and lifestyle. Superstitious control of destiny. There are two types of this control. Either control the present, for example the awliya, their shrines and their dignity, the jinn, the orcs and the devil, the hostile relationships, the envy and the magic. Where the oppressed person attributes what he is exposed to in his life for one of these reasons. Or the second type of control, which is controlling the future, such as flying, dream interpretation, fortune-telling and divination. Where his fate is related to one of these aspects. Or to attribute his status and backwardness, and anything that was destined to be delivered to him. Violence. Some manifestations of violence: Masked violence. The aggression, whether self-defeating or outward-oriented. Symbolic violence. Like delinquent behavior. Existential tension and persecutory relations. Among the psychological theories that explained aggression and violence: A view of animal psychology. A psychoanalytic view. Phenomenological point of view. Finally, it is necessary to talk about the position of women in the underdeveloped society, which has the largest share of oppression and marginalization. The writer has drawn features of the oppression that women live in the industrious and under-industrious milieu, in the middle class and in the privileged group. One of the oppressions experienced by women is deficiency and reduction. And the looting is either economic, sexual or ideological and is the most dangerous. Among the defensive methods women use against oppression are narcissistic inflation and indirect control over men.

Long for one cause, which is to raise a voice Stalking and nullifying falsehood and limiting the lives that are constantly lost in the corridors of dark prisons, where the false force is exercised, taking advantage of power and influence. Rajab asked: Is it possible to repair the will of a person whom I no longer associate with life in connection .. I am that person, no, I am not a human being, the prison in his early days tried to kill my body. I did not imagine that I endured everything they did but I endured it was only my will that receives the blows and turns back angry looks and silence. I was misled as well.

And many many human values are buried here and there among the folds of the book. He accompanies you on a journey floating around with different feelings .. between anger and contentment .. between laughter and crying .. and sometimes even bereavement. Confused about speeding up to keep pace with events or slowing down so long to enjoy. It touches on many contradictions .. our hateful racism .. our unjust class ... our pure materialism ... our social hypocrisy ... our false condemnation ... and our complying with the unfair restrictions of society that God has brought down from authority. However, he was not satisfied with criticism only, but also praised some of the prevailing positive values, such as coexistence among a group of crazies ... friendship ... and the spread of peace between people, for example. In more than one personality, the writer raises the idea that evil is not rooted in the human soul, but it is an urgent matter .. It is the result of harsh conditions and suffering .. hardening the heart and obscuring his mercy, perhaps an invitation not to rush to judge others .. despite the fact that the novel is a special case for a Filipino / Kuwaiti Tah Between two countries .. except that all expatriate workers can be compared to them .. the next time you see a foreign worker .. remember that he has a humble house in the land of Mendoza of his own .. and has a family ..

Positive,Positive,":. Book review video: : //. . / = .... The first novel by Izz al-Din Shukri, and it turns out that his style really evolved a lot in. The following accounts, but it is clear that one of the first things that he started with has the ability to draw the reader&#39;s attention to the end .. The novel is as if it were compilations of writings, narrations and talk about Fakhr al-Din, a person who died and has an investigator investigating his death case by referring to his past and history after the issue strangely closed. The novel in its six parts begins with the life of Fakhr El Din in his village and then the secondary period that had a great impact on changing his personality. The university period and his studies at the Faculty of Law and the psychological, emotional, and fateful fluctuations of Fakhruddin’s life, followed by the period he spent in the army that coincided with The timing of Iraq’s occupation of Kuwait, followed by his tenure as a lawyer and his relationship to his beloved Sherine .. See through all this the personality of Fakhruddin with its advantages and disadvantages, Fakhruddin is a very ideal person, adhering to his principles that accompanied him from childhood, loving to others but his biggest flaw is his pride that cost him a lot, He even cost him his soul at the end of each narration For those who knew him, he became more like a living corpse, alive but he lost his soul .. With the end of each chapter, one of them confirms the death of the pride of religion in a different way, this may lead to some people thinking that they are talking about the different pride of each of them, but it is the same pride of religion that was killed by his disappointment in his family and their betrayal To him after the death of his mother and father, he killed him, his first companions abandoned him with the first crossroads, the selfishness of the university comrades, the cruelty of the army, the brutality of the law firm and the greed of society, that Fakhreddin died more than once. And every time I make sure that the pride of religion in one form or another represents me at some point in my life .. The novel, although it begins with a police start, is a societal novel with a political character, we see the defects of society through the pride of religion, which is not without its own flaws as well, which we sympathize With her or we decide to overlook her because we see the cruelty of the world around him .. The novel is flawed by the rapid movement from time to the second and from a personality to the other on the same page without clarifying that in most of the time, but that the words of pride of religion in most of the times are more like speeches and this is unrealistic, I felt pride Debt is ideal, sometimes too much.

Positive,Positive,"It was very unfair to say that the last version of the Temple Secrets. Is it a response from the author Paul Sussman to the novel The Da Vinci Code? After looking at and reading the two, it came out that the two followed several points, which makes the individual say that they are the same, not the opposite? . The style of the novel .. historical police where you start. With a murder that brings us to successive events from the stories and legends of Lofu and the distant past of Da Vinci&#39;s paintings, he pondered some of his paintings, as he was making fun and hard of some religious beliefs. This is the first similar point in terms of style or type of novel, to be more precise. As for events, they revolve around a religious symbol that can show the power of belief and other heroes .. Here it seems that Paul Sussman has taken the same path with a religious symbol that may be used to ignite another war if it occurs with the wrong hands. My evaluation of the novel was going to be because it from the beginning was inconsistent. The reader cannot understand the course of the event. Except when it passed for the sixth semester .. But it included information that enriches the reader very creatively, so it was evaluated by a counterpart. Cultural, religious, and historical information that is evident and which reflects experience and culture. I still think, however, that the last mysteries of the Temple surpass the Da Vinci Code, perhaps because the characters were not walking, but were swept away by events, to create an unparalleled masterpiece, unlike this narration, where the monk was. Langdon and Sophie are walking to cover up the truth or hide it, as happened with the monk
