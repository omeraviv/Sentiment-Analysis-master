"Taste the taste of the grill and enjoy the experience. A friend said to me about his experience in tasting their food, which attracted me to try it. When I went to it, I had difficulty finding a position because of the zahk. I stood in line and bought four types of rice that he had in addition to the chicken grill. And he reminded me of pick-up flavors, the taste for rice is frankly all similar to the flavor of the spice is overwhelming and this means no distinctive taste the chicken is well roasted and spices maggie one of its components that are placed inside the chicken gives a new flavor to the grill chicken and is the same mixture that the West puts inside the turkey the cause of the noise and Fame is that it is by style restaurants For fast food in the demand mode and queue numbers

"Ahmed Al Shugairi is a person whose words are not enough for me to express the feelings of goodness, peace, mercy and goodness within me. This introduction came to classify the thought that I can talk about when I talk about something that he has supervised as a writer or regarding his thoughts .. A beautiful book differs somewhat in its content The book is divided into two parts The first section, which talks about Ahmed Al Shugairi&#39;s trip to India and the second section which In it he tells us about his journey with Gandhi, the most important and greatest of the things that he took his way to tell us about the genius Gandhi. In general, the book is very beautiful in its idea and it contains some real information, which clearly wrote utterly to solve some societal issues. I did not content myself with the first section and I wanted to extend the trip to get to know India more, which will motivate me to visit India.

Love is the state of Alana&#39;s identification with the other. Yazinab never absent and present in the conscience. I am the one here I am not who I was. Sadness, human beings varied from resident and from transit. Optimism is a great risk for my likes. Her face took her astonishment.

"Most people judge books based on the cover, which is common. As for others like me, I judge him from the beginning of his pages; the writing style is what makes me keep reading .. In this novel specifically, I read the first of its pages and felt like a continuation of another book, as the writer started to tell the story as if the reader knows what he is talking about .. I stopped reading I put the book aside, I was very surprised when I got this high evaluation? It is true that people&#39;s tastes differ, but everyone who asks and reads from him finds him praising him and saying, keep reading, it&#39;s wonderful. I didn&#39;t give them any attention, and I read several other books, but destiny wanted me to think about it, and I found a colleague of mine who encouraged me to read it with me .. I started and deepened, and I signed this book from those books that you find yourself thinking about and wondering about, I felt that I was actually with them , I felt the sadness that they feel, with joy, of resentment, and even of the taste of the pies they eat .. I lived with them their joy and their sorrow, and what more sadness. The novel begins with the grandfather and ends with the grandson of the granddaughter.

"W Barcelona offers residential services I stayed at the W Barcelona from day to day, in a great room. I arrived early and registered my name at the hotel. The registration process is always busy, and there is a big and happy surprise but with mixed feelings. Sometimes your early arrival leads you to a room that no one else wants. My share of room number, was on the fifth floor. The beach was opposite my room, but a third of the view was obstructing me due to the other prominent rooms at the front. This only affects the first floors, so be careful, as each room ends with a number that has the same problem. These rooms are also adjacent to the storage and laundry rooms, among others. I loved the design of the room, the shared desk with the bed is very soft, what a really good bed spoil me, as well as the spacious space. The shower space can accommodate five people, not joking, so let’s consider, for example, that you took your boyfriend to have sex for the first time. You will inevitably discover the peculiarities of their bathroom laughing out loud. I did not consume anything from the room fridge, as there is a big store and restaurants at the beginning of the beach, and this is a pleasant walk away. Prices for the pool area and services are very moderate. On Sunday, on the top floor, you do not stop by the pool, the staff working in this area did not check the area even once, so I did not receive any services. Another day, I learned that the top floor was open, and I went up. I learned that it was closed when I asked for a service. Then I learned that it is not closed, but there is no service. I was just meters away from the main bar. The position of the workers in this area is as if they say, I know, man, that we are very calm. We do a favor for you here. However, I left the area and did not return to it for the duration of my stay. Hint I use the signs; I can&#39;t read minds, but if the staff is so lazy that they can&#39;t do the services upstairs, there&#39;s something wrong. At the nightclub, I was disappointed again because of the lack of communication, and the lack of signs or information about the region&#39;s protocols. I saw every two sitting on your sofas, so I had to leave completely. If there were signs, there would be no embarrassment for the people. After eleven o&#39;clock in the evening this region becomes private and the cost of staying in euros is where the excellent service provided by the workers once the place is opened. It seems that those who provide alcoholic beverages are good, but when they are busy like this then there will be speed, yet my drink was moderate. Wave Restaurant I had a very good meal, and a great attentive service made me happy. Managers always work hard, but sometimes regret can be an easy backup. Guest services What about the low seating for guests? Sitting in this drop feels as if the seat is the one sitting on you, the opposite must be done, according to the known power arrangement. And we ended up changing rooms, on the number floor, room number, which is the same type of room as it overlooks a port, after I mentioned that the wonderful rooms are supposed to have nothing to obscure seeing from them. Note that the warm rooms are located on floors from to; these rooms seem to be great except for rooms from to; all overlook the ocean and the harbor. As for all the large rooms and others overlooking the beach and the city. Location I did not find the location far from the old neighborhoods, so you can walk on foot, or take the bus number / which stops on the main road near the hotel entrance, and the price of the bus ticket. Euros, and the taxi may cost you approximately Euros. Overall, I would probably come here again, as the location fits in with me, as is the layout of the room, the bathroom was excellent and the two rooms were reasonably quiet. It was a shame there was the low pool service as well as what is known as nerve cooling. As the title shows, this place caters to a specific demographic as it focuses on it well, but I am not a fashion fan, but all I want is comfort and kindness. It is a service.

"I was one of the lucky ones to see a draft of that novel. So my testimony will be hurt. Regardless of my witness to the labor period, the author is one of the closest to my heart on a personal level. So I will try to summarize. Adoration is the next novel for a peace hymn. If you like the hymn, you will love. Abdul Majeed has developed a lot of his style of narration and has started to move from event to smooth event. In a passion he entered into the convolutions of the soul more, so he made clear the difference between the human qualities that make man from a person who does not rise to the quality of angels and does not descend from the characteristics of demons. In love you will understand more about the Igo .. The Igo that prevents us from rising and without Ego will give us wings to fly in the sky. He also dealt with traffickers, the greatest of souls and most of them. I liked his new narration. Connecting the past to the present.

"The Rubaiyat of Khayyam is a philosophical poem with distinction in which faith is mixed with skepticism, pessimism with optimism, confusion with certainty, existence with nothing. Omar Khayyam invites them to enjoy life with all its pleasures, and what wine he praises in this work is only a symbol of this material life. Khayyam believes that our earthly life is much better than our eschatological life, adopting the nihilistic view of life, this life that has no meaning in all its tragedies and the misery of people in it and also what our emergency presence is in .. In this poem also there is an internal struggle between the life of the faithful tents who He wants to repent of his sins and the age of Khayyam, who doubts and revolts on religious concepts of fate, resurrection, and lastlife .. Indeed, there is still discussion about the ratio of these Khumaiyat quarters to Omar Khayyam, who was known for his morals and knowledge, but this does not prevent classification These quartets as a philosophical work explores the depths of the human psyche in their crises of existence Of this world Alamvhom and ruthless.

"This is a charade, as Dr. Mustafa Mahmoud said, it is inspired by what Sheikh al-Akbar Muhyiddin bin Arabi wrote about the counterattack, that is, the contradictory struggle within the human soul, when the soul wants something and wishes its opposite. And the text revolves, as the doctor points out about the apparent name, and he is the ruler and predominant of the people of the earth. Then the inner name, which is the ruler and predominant among the people of the subcontractor, who loves isolation, being alone, meditating and worshiping .. The conflict actually revolves between two personalities that represent controversy and conflict between the people of al-Zahir and the people of the subcontinent, or the worldly soul searching for pleasures and satisfying instincts. , And the blame soul searching for serenity and salvation .. The events of the representation that have been invalidated by a Sufi woman and her hero are represented by a man representing a outward personality, then a dialogue takes place between them, after which he ends up asking her to follow her, so she tells him that he will not be able to patience with her, and the taking continues The response to the speech in the context of an accelerated fiasco represents an opposing viewpoint ... just as it is complete Thelaya includes lyrical lyric connections, through which the heroine recites poetic passages from Ibn Arabi&#39;s poetry in a way that is appropriate to the context of the latest .. The hero’s ideas soon begin to collapse and the woman answers, saying: You trained my brain and thwarted my mind .. from you to God .. from you Allah. Then the events move on to talk about the injustice and negativity of the nation, the book includes a summary for this is: Muslims smoke hookahs in cafes and wait for God to be loved for them. And it is a shame .. and a fallacy even in the matter of their religion. After that, the book moves on to talk about the fundamentalist groups that have distorted the image of Islam by taking the path of violence. The doctor says: The Islamic groups have started from completely wrong beginnings and are still insisting on them .. which is an attempt to jump on power and usurp the rule .. And I thought that jihad begins From jihad with the other and conflict with the other .. I forgot that the jihad actually begins from the jihad with the soul and the struggle with the enemy that lies within the soul .. Satan, selfishness, fanaticism, the devil of intolerance, archeology, and madness of empty leadership .. I forgot that Islam started with thirteen A year of psychological education in the school of prophethood, where the great companions were trained in c Ed older with self .. in the separation of Walker snakes Amplifies Dr talking about Israel and what the Zionists are doing from the crime and killing and seek arms from one side in the face of the world of Islam, and the extent of their threat to Slmm.

They are shouting at us by promoting the merchandise of Islamic terrorism that they made, funded, and rented to him the professional mafia gangs that raise the slogans of Islam .. to accuse our Islam of what was fasted With their Torah.

"The second part of rare cases was full of exciting and strange stories during which the writer fought terrifying adventures, but they must have been interesting. In this part, I lived with every teenage girl .. but my wonder was bigger .. Because I really realized that the women’s plot is often great. These accounts showed me many facts that I cannot believe in my life because of the nature of the kind woman who is looking for tenderness only. The story of our neighbor&#39;s girl who bury cats amazed me with her amazing ability to mask a story of fiction and even her ability to do such a pernicious work that is the heart of a human being. And the story of where my husband’s wealth is no less than her predecessor, so how can this kind, loyal woman to her husband dare to do such a thing, but how can this sister of her wife take revenge and plan a crime that is worse than this real world ugly brutally brutal secrets ... As for the flat girl number has loved her a lot .. Her innocence and personality that really attracted me, even though her story did not carry a lot of weirdness. Someone visited us at night and astral projection interfered with the symptoms of Stendhal .. I liked it very much. I was very interested in the issue of hysterical fleeing ...

"The two books provide the most important insights for those interested in change. The first part was more literary and enjoyable than the second part, which was marred by many lengthy dialogues that resemble articles. In my opinion, the prominent weakness of the two works was dialogue, sometimes you find it colloquial and sometimes you find it fluent without logical control. I don’t mind mixing colloquial with classical if he finds a strong justification for that .. Perhaps the second part of his style in which he wrote was tended because of the urgent need for the writer to develop the idea of the two books more. I was struck by the technical details and the details of business administration and development work .. In the end I was very impressed with the two works despite the drawbacks that I had on him .. Despite my feeling of some kind of boredom in the middle of the second part .. A very important work especially that it was written in the pre-revolutionary period and has many predictions and lessons Unfortunately, we did not benefit from the revolution, such as mixing abstract development work with politics, its adaptations and endless adventures. And like the need to pave the society and raise its human quality in order to better receive change and contribute to it effectively

"What makes someone special in his field is not just talent, but talent when it reaches the limit of madness ... I have always wondered ... Who is where Saramago comes with those imaginary societies? How can he weave a story where everything is so mixed up? In his writings, Saramago always creates a state of collective awareness that moves society as a single block towards something, or towards a strange event ... In death interruptions, the writer imagines ... what if death feels bored one day, and then decides to stop? What will happen ? What is the impact of that on the people of this community? He wonders in blindness .. What if everyone becomes blind? What could happen in a community of blind people? How do people deal with this phenomenon? He wonders here in Insight .. What if the people decide to challenge the government and not elect anyone? How does the government act on this? What will be the people&#39;s reaction to what the government did? Questions you may see as silly and silly, but Saramago grasps them wisely and weaves them into a solid and beautiful garment ... The answers to these questions, and the truth is said, illogical, and you may feel that they are unnatural .. But who said that Saramago is natural or logical? Didn&#39;t we just say that creativity that is not characterized by insanity is not creativity? Another thing that distinguishes Saramago is that he tells the novel in a reader-like manner, not a narrator, so you find him sometimes wondering what will happen in the novel shortly and sometimes updating himself with thoughts that revolve in his mind ... What really exhausted me is the narration style .. long breathless phrases .. lots and lots of sentences The objection that requires a present mind to pass it ... I saw this before in the interruptions of death and I thought it was a translation error, but I found it here too ... You can pass all this and enjoy it with a little patience, but if you are not patient, then I advise you to try. .

What I can say is that this fruitful reading has opened my eyes to a deep thought and a unique analytical approach in dealing with problems and humanitarian issues. There is no doubt that I will have a return to the origin of this biography, that is, my intellectual journey in seeds, roots and fruit, as one of the thinkers said that life after I got acquainted with Al-Masiri&#39;s intellectual journey differs from life before reviewing it.

I was impressed by the empty language of the Imam, from any cost or concealment, and he impressed me with the breadth of his knowledge and the breadth of his chest in his quotations from various Arab and foreign writers and in various fields. It amazes me that one of them claims that he is a scholar of religion and did not read to the Imam, and I was amazed at the capacity of religion and his ease, and how much we escaped from this capacity, closed minds and hearts

"I did not know the secret of the violent attack on this novel, because the end did not satisfy the audience. I think it is the first part of a trilogy that Zaidan will write or so it was said .. Zidane, as usual, is a wizard and a cunning, so his literary rhetoric adorns the words of that novel. As for coercion, the genealogy was flowing between the lines. It strikes under the belt by opening controversial topics and leaves it to the reader in his neutral style. Is Zidane a religious writer, is he biased to the ideas of Islam and nationalism, or is he just a neutral who exposes things to the satisfaction of a larger audience? In the end, I believe that it is a good novel, and I am eagerly awaiting the rest of its parts.

"Finally, I finished the readers of the book The Ottoman Empire, which entertained me a lot. In its development and role the state of the adult caliphate. The writer started talking about the origin of the Turks, their conversion to Islam, and the establishment of the Ottoman Empire at the hands of Othman bin Artgrel. A nation that does not read its history is a lost nation between the darkness of ignorance and error, and this is our situation today. If we read our history well, we would know our enemies in our present as they were the enemies of our ancestors in the past. This book presents the plots woven against Islam and Muslims, such as Freemasonry and Zionism and how they used weak rulers to implement their despicable desires, such as Muhammad Ali Pasha, the governor of Egypt who was a poisonous dagger used by the enemies in the implementation of their plans. Between the lines of Ottoman history, my heart oscillated between the elation of the conquest of Constantinople at the hands of Mehmed the Conqueror and the deposition of Sultan Abdul Hamid II and the fall of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. At the end of the book, the writer appended the causes of the fall and collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

"The book is divided into two parts, the first part is the book itself, and the second part is the AKP and Turkish program. Part one: the book. Worth three stars. In my opinion, it was prepared by the second part of a previous book, but by another author, Ali Muhammad Muhammad al-Salabi. The book is the Ottoman Empire, the factors of rise and causes of the fall. The writer started the book from the time of the fall of the Ottoman Empire at the hands of Ataturk and quickly passed through the most prominent events that it passed through, especially the Islamic parties that took power like the National System Party .. Then he moved to a qualitative shift in the history of Turkish rule, which is Najm al-Din Erbakan and his parties Safety, Welfare and Happiness . In this brief, the features of the Turkish state, which are fiercely secular and loyal to the policies of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, are clear to us until the army interferes in its entirety if these principles are threatened and it performs a military coup if necessary, as it did in a coup when it carried out the coup against the Najmuddin government, the problem of the Safety Party. Then the author moves to the axis of the book, which is Erdogan, then he deals with the story of his origin and his disciples at the hands of Erbakan, then he took over the Istanbul municipality and arrested him, then he left and set up for the Justice and Development Party and passed on his three elections, the last of which was fought in the last year. The book in its entirety is good, especially in the tendency of Dr. Willing to simplify matters to suit the non-specialist. One of the bad deeds of the book was the photos in it. The book contained many pictures and it is an excellent way to clarify a lot of things, especially in maps and others, but the pictures here were misplaced and not selected accurately. They are normal pictures like Erdogan&#39;s and another image of a giant banner for his election campaign, and so if the images were selected more accurately, it would be an excellent thing. Part Two: The Party&#39;s Program. Worth five stars. The least described program as a program of understanding people. The program is based on a thorough study of the conditions and conditions of Turkish society, its capabilities and the resources available to it. A program made specifically to suit Turkey with its values, civilizational assets and available resources. Until you find that, for example, in talking about livestock, it identifies the best places for you to develop livestock. Part of fundamental rights and freedoms is one of the best approaches I&#39;ve seen, especially in its relevance to a country of a complex nature such as Turkey. The state is very secular, secular and loyal to Ataturk&#39;s policy, and the party is a party that draws its ideas from the correct Islamic approach and with a flimsy party policy, especially with the repetition of military coups, it becomes clear to us how bad the situation is, what did the founders of the party ?? They resorted to defining and defining concepts, especially with the relativity of political concepts, and created a marriage between the secularism of the state and the Islamism of the party in a wonderful political system. See in the program it. We see religion as one of the most important components of humanity and secularism as a necessary thing for democracy, with an emphasis on freedom of religion and belief and we refuse to distort secularism by making it in hostility with religion .. Secularism is a principle that allows everyone regardless of their religion and their belief in:. Freely practice their beliefs. Express their convictions the way they want to live. At the same time, secularism gives those who do not owe a debt mainly the right to organize matters of their lives consistent with this trend .. And when he spoke about the policy to which they seek they said about it. Politics is the will of society to build a present in accordance with sound rules and foundations and to carefully plan its future. There is a lot and a lot in the party’s program, but it must be emphasized that the only benefit in my opinion from this program is specialization. Each country has its own principles, values, and available resources that can be exploited. Each country must have its own experience of being affected by other experiences, not by blind transportation or application

The hero is a pharmacist, and the events clarify to some extent what the pharmacist suffers in our reactionary Egyptian society. How did we transform that profession into mere hands that transmit the drug only? Also, the vipers ’gram was also a note that is not longer noticeable from the frequent eating that Ahmed Murad tends in his novels and works to the degree of cost not to add new To events and will not affect if deleted. I don’t know if the imagination is sick or the writer wanted to attract a certain type of readers to buy a lot of editions.

"A very important discovery this year. Wonderful Wadih Saadeh. Have you heard about nihilism? Here nihilism will smell and breathe in his words. The office is wonderful and elegant prose. I chose for you these two syllables. . The dusters. The desolate roads of Habun alone. The earth has become dust, and here we are completing the life of dust .. We are continuing the life of the dust of the earth. This is someone who must complete his life, and here we do .. We do not complete the life of the earth, but the life of our dust. We do not complete life, but death. We came to accompany the dust in his last blow, we carried him to his resting place, and we slept with him .. The land was not like us. It is our opposite and we are its ruins. We did not come to complete that land, but to denounce it. We did not come to continue, but to deny .. No religion before us, no religion after us, no religion. Dusters without religion or religion, for dust is nothing but aerosols. They swim in a vacuum. In space whose mother or son does not Earth. In the paternity vacuum and the sonship vacuum. We are going to our God, to nothing .. We are the dusters, and this is what we saw in our blowing, this was not something before it became dust, it was nothing before we became dust. . Beauty transit. Beautiful fast transients. They don&#39;t leave a shadow. Perhaps a little dust, it soon disappears ... the most beautiful among us, abandoned his presence. Leaving a clean room vacant seat. Beautiful in the air in the absence of his voice. Clarity in the dirt with its uncultivated area. The most beautiful among us: the absentee .. Boycott the place and boycott the time lightly. Do not leave the place to overturn it, nor for the time to waste it. He devoted himself in the quick blowing, leaving no one who left his bed or wheat for his field. Retracted from the condition of walking to reach. Withdrawal from access .. Transit quickly as a migrant angel. Not leaving residency may be a place of sin. Not committing a sin, not committing a residence ... quickly under a sun that does not touch him, under rain that does not wet him, on dirt from which no impact remains. Quickly without trace, no legacy, no legacy .. He did not have enough skills to learn a language. He did not have to absorb habits. He has no language, habits, teachers, or students. Passing over language, above customs, above ranks, names and imitation ... without a name, above calling and calling ... and above gestures, except for the gesture of crossing ... and without sound, because the sound is heavy in the air ... because the sound may collide with another. It might crush another sound in space. It may disturb the breezes ... and without desire. Because the desire to establish steadfastness .. transients quickly beautiful. Do not reside in a place in which to leave the ugliness. They do not have enough time to leave a stain in the memory of the residents ... who stayed long with us, leaving spots on the fabric of our memory that we do not know how to erase them ... painful spots, wherever it is on the seats, so that we can no longer sit .. long residents take away our seats. They turn our home furniture into pieces. So that we sit, if we sit, on their ribs, on their bones ... the resident residents are crushed. As for those who pass, they do not crush anyone and no one crushes them. They shall not be trampled upon beings, nor be burdened with footsteps. Even the air does not hint at them for a moment ... without anxiety, regret, gods or followers. One faith for them: crossing ... abandoning places, homelands, fathers and sons. Restrictions. The vandals of the gallows made of iron, place, time and belonging .. They are falling, one after another, clinging to the residence. Falling with their homelands, which became an illusion. Their affiliations, which became a lie. With their paternity, which has become a burden. With their faith that kills us, kills them, and kills life ... transients have no victims. Do we therefore have to glorify life quickly, to glorify its transit, to glorify suicide? Lightly bird whisk and open Aura wing. The openness of the transit air was lightly open, and the starting air did not pass .. They passed quickly, as a moment of diminution .. They had a voice from the sparrow, from a branch, a look, from a blossoming Shamim .. their birds to sing and leave, not to be imprisoned in cages or paved in mummified facades. Their birds are the traveling spirit, not the feathered resident .. and their fragrant fragrant flowers outside the pot ... other than the traveling, the indifferent, the tampering with the residence, the possessed, and the dead, who would have discovered the beauty of crossing? And what moment does life discover more than the moment of its absence? Is it necessary for the leave to be authenticated more than the residence permit? And, therefore, should our life be just an exercise in the beauty of leaving? The most beautiful of the departed. The most beautiful suicide. Those who did not want anything and did not take anything. Those who took one step in the river were enough to discover the waters ... the most beautiful of us who are not among us. Those who left us are light, leaving modestly, their seats for people who may come now, to this party ... a silly party, and yet the tenants do not leave the seat. But why not seats, as long as the celebrities start guests and end enemies? Let us go, then, lightly, before the daggers swallow us up, before we make the banquet dish .. The moment of reaching the celebration is the beauty of the celebration. And then, soon, the beauty becomes the departure. The departure step is always the most beautiful. The departed are mixed with the breeze. As we stand to make funeral for them, let us commemorate their memory also. Because memory hinders their departure, brings them back to their place, makes them inanimate ... Memory hinders those who wish to die. And make those who want to live dead .. Let us bury it then .. to bury the memory while we sing .. It is a silly party in any case, but since we have arrived, let us sing and dance .. seconds, we may be beautiful .. but the most beautiful will remain: the absent .. Thank you Oh wonderful, I will make sure to read the rest of your work. And scheduling them within my plans

"Your only proof of freedom remains when Victor Hugo decided to present his novel The Miserable in the nineteenth century, he did not know that it would turn into this great cam of art, which met with artistic and public success and demand, and became the primary source for many of them, so the genius director Tom Hopper came to present it once Others are in a musical saga, creating a different atmosphere, with perfect craftsmanship, as if you are watching her heroes on stage and not in front of a lyrical movie. With every scene, you will feel a desire to applaud the director Huber&#39;s ingenuity in pushing his actors to sing directly in front of the camera until you feel with their voice sadness and imprisonment and To the extreme anger of what they are subjected to, and that feeling will not diminish when you rush to sing with them as if you are one of them, as well as his skill and strength in choosing the actors especially the actress Anna Hathaway who succeeded with great mastery in presenting the character of Fantine, and despite her short role but her strength in performing the character was drawn A basic line for her in the movie, and she presented an aesthetic image of the mother and her great sacrifice. And the performance of each of the two stars Russell Crowe, and Hugh Jackman will not be less than the same power of Hathaway, where everyone succeeded in increasing the beautiful meanings of the novel, and far from the well-known story that was presented as much as we mentioned and I mention among them a wonderful Atef Salem, which was starred by the Egyptian screen monster Farid Shawky, this time he is forced The elves went to steal a loaf of bread, and then he is sentenced to prison. After leaving, he escapes from observation, and the officer remains sentinel looking for him to bring him back behind bars ... We find that the writer that Boublil focused in the dialogue on the true message that Hugo always presents in his writings and writings where the human message is presented through Deep dimensions were represented by a guy B freedom of mankind, oppression and injustice to which it is exposed and the bad social conditions that oppress it, the most important of which is ignorance ....

Zidane elaborated on explaining Arabic theology and shred it. As for the connection of religious violence with theology, it was not clear or sufficient, but rather was closer in his conversation with creation.

"Championship, motivation and the main driver of events are the revolutionary idea and situation and the desire to make a fundamental change in society, not people. The idea that Dostoevsky clearly declares his wish to change and rebel for a better life is why people give such great attention to others&#39; opinions about them, that they control their lives and are considered their weak point and through which they can easily control them with the remote control. The analysis is still waiting for me to have the opportunity to give him the right to write in detail, perhaps after finishing the second part. When I had the opportunity to complete what I started, I found that the supplement was required:. You are confused as you approach the end of this chapter in the classification of characters .. From a good and a wicked person in particular Nikolai Staffogen .. He and his friend Peter are very complex and very complex personalities that curse them sometimes sympathize with them and seek excuse for them. In the end, you really find yourself wondering: Will I know at the end of the novel who the demons are, and whether they include the father and teacher Stephen Trovimovich .. He is the other who seems to suffer from diseases of selfishness, negativity and inaction, the inability to resolve any issue or make any decision .. These characters are considered to be rejected characters in Societies preparing for a fundamental social change in them, where the negative intellectual is hated and undesirable .. It does not provide, but delay. One of the most wonderful dialogues in the novel is Stephen&#39;s dialogue with Varvara Petrovna, when she attacked him violently, accusing him of wanting to exclusively acquire knowledge, and in return, he despises others on the pretext that he is more knowledgeable .. He is stingy with his knowledge so he is responsible for what they reached and directly to. But we find that he himself is frank with himself and reveals it in front of his friend, the narrator, and confesses that he is like a capricious child, who has many freaks, and he says: You have put your finger, my friend, on a painful sore point, and that the friendly fingers are cruel, merciless, but lack civility. Sometimes I think of this woman, Farvara Petrovna, who has reached that whole amount of generosity, tolerance and patience towards my bad faults, the truth is that she is not a lot of patience. But is it permissible for me to complain about the bad nature of myself, who I likened to the child in extreme selfishness without having the innocence of the child ?? As usual, in light of societal developments, we find that there is no dialogue between the heroes of any revolutionary movement that is free of these sentences that bounce by rebelling against the frozen ideas that the clerics boil in order to control the poor of society and compel them with religious authority to accept the class differences and the abhorrent reality to them, this sentence came to Stefan Trofimovich:. The more painful a difficult life for a person, and the more miserable persecuted people are, the more persistent the dreams of rewards that they will receive in Paradise. And of course, you do not find a society devoid of the likes of Leputin the chatter, the gossip that does not stop rhythm among some friends to control them and know their weaknesses and influence them through them ... And we find that this is what Ibn Stephan excelled in controlling the wife of the ruler, which is what we will find in the second part The conflict rages, and the ends begin to take clear paths

"Wonderful book, including the meanings of the letters. Very light despite the amount of information presented in it and its ease of absorption, especially for those who are not inclined to books on philosophy and religions. The author got off to a strong start with those heavy questions in the eyes of those who are ignorant of it and simple in view of those who worked hard to know the details of our religion, Islam. So the difference between Islam and other religions is thank God that I was aware of the answer in advance, if somewhat shallow. Hence, the story of the search started with Ben Atheism, Christ, Gentiles and others. I learned many things that I went through daily and I never thought of them as the names of the gods and their meanings. And how it has become the names of famous landmarks, brands and others. Also, I always wondered why they worshiped the Buddha to this degree. Ignorance reached them, so the writer explained the story of the Buddha, why did people start worshiping him, etc. In addition, I liked his dialogue with foreigners, and his attempt to lure them without fanaticism, leaving them with a chance to think without pressure. In particular, his conversation with the woman, and how verses from Surat Al-Nisaa misinterpreted what is apparent in front of her and not in the hidden sense. Here lies the miracles of the Qur’an, and we do not learn from the Qur’an from the first reading and the first thought, but it requires care, attention and effort to take all the benefits from it, so let the Qur’an be the spring of our hearts. As for his visit to the church, my curiosity has increased around me for as long as I wanted to explore it from the inside and I am trying to enter into dialogue with them, except my fear prevents me and the poverty of information brings me back steps. In a chapter, a soul, and their pastors, he spoke about human personalities and their types inferred from the Holy Qur’an, and he impressed me. The book as a whole is very useful, showing the writer&#39;s eagerness to deliver information in a simple and clear way despite the diversity of information. He did not hesitate to put evidence from all religions. There is a quote that I like the quotation of German physicist Werner Heisenberg. You will likely become an atheist when you drink from the cup of knowledge, but be absolutely certain that you will find God awaiting you at the end of the cup

"A book that starts from scratch with jihad operations in Saudi Arabia, the author divides jihad into two classical jihad, which generally represents a speech in Chechnya and the global jihad that represents bin Laden, the author studies how jihad begins in Afghanistan and how the Saudi government was supporting the Mujahideen and receiving them as heroes. Then how the repression that happened to the Awakening in general and the jihadists in particular in the mid-nineties. What made many after their release tend to Al Qaeda and the global jihad that many were not convinced before this suppression because it causes a lot of controversy unlike the classic jihad that comfort the Saudi mind more since it is an aggression against an infidel gas in Chechnya, for example, the author progresses with history down to The September events that caused al-Qaeda to direct its operations into Saudi Arabia after the fall of the Taliban in Kabul, and how the dispute between al-Zawahiri and bin Laden was against al-Eiri, who saw the inappropriate time to launch an attack inside the kingdom, but bin Laden’s insistence and launching suicide attacks gradually weakened al-Qaeda to That almost ended. There is a lot also that the author on Chechnya, Bosnia and other sub-fronts touched upon, if you will .. In my view, the book is very excellent for those who wanted to understand that stage.

Khurshid was able to appear in the media after the January Revolution, but the book remains more important than its TV interviews, although in these meetings more What about the book .. And the most important thing I see D focus on him from the lessons and benefits of this book: that a person under tyranny loses all his defensive elements and all kinds of his dignity, even the innate ones, so he can accept that the husband of a woman knows everyone that she is another lover, and accepts to marry a woman who knows that she is another partner ..

But as soon as the individual engages in an audience, he takes the traits of what he was there or it can be said that they exist, but he did not dare to reveal it and express it. The individual, once engaged in an audience, loses his mentality, acts reasonably and is governed by emotions. Inspiring images and cheerful slogans are what take over the soul of the audience. Even tyrants are eager to inspire the imagination of the masses and the flames of their enthusiasm.

"Qushtumur second reading:. The first reading was in a microbus and I am returning after I bought Qeshmutr for 6 pounds in Mansoura. The story is not about the five friends. The narrator is a friend of a spectator who did not appear in his capacity as being satisfied with the transfer and commentary on the authority of Taher Al-Adri and Hamada Ibn Al-Thawat, who loves the thing and turns against it. ..And it is true that there is no more correct concept of happiness .. There is a reference to the book “The Return of the Sheikh that Al-Sabbagh brought to one of the characters of the novel.” This is what came to my mind where Professor Muhammad Abdul Nabi brought his novel The Return of the Sheikh. The last for the bitch and the storyteller. / Quoting from the narrator before we are guided to Qushtamur coffee ..

"To start with, the most beautiful thing about this novel is the apparent change in the personality of the wolf Omar ... He turns from a reckless young man who does not even perform his prayers .. He does not know anything about his religion ... without a goal .. Oh God only collect money in every way .. legal or not legitimacy. To the strength of the Mujahid, Omar Dsarov .. who sacrifices the precious and precious for the sake of his religion and his cause, which he believes in the most faith .. Negatives in my view :. As everyone mentioned .. Lots of spelling and language errors .. The dialogue that took place between Omar and the leader of the Arab camp, who was an aide to the Mujahid, a speech that God has mercy on and accepted as a martyr: ? He said that its people are the best on earth. Of course, as it is known .. the hadith is weak ... and we in Egypt are now suffering from the scourge of the spread of this hadith as correct. So it caught my eye very hard .. I wanted to mention it. Most of the dialogues revolve around the issue being the issue of the homeland in the first place .. Yes, I mentioned the issue of religion a lot .. but. What we know about Chechen jihad is that it is an authentic ideological. The end was not what I expected .. Throughout the story and I feel happy .. But the end saddened me a lot .. It was crying especially for the presence of the innocent child who will be orphaned in the end:. My positives:. A novel that talks about Chechen jihad .. This in itself is creativity:. Although many did not like coordination and the method of moving from one event to another .. However, he liked me a lot .. but he needed more skill: .. I hope that this aspect will be corrected in the upcoming works of the writer, God willing:. The information in the novel is very useful and useful .. I felt shy about my lack of information about the history of the forgotten Caucasus:. But it forced me to read its history and study it, God willing:. The development of the Omar dialect was an excellent symbol of the change of his personality, mentality, thoughts, and method.

"I started reading the blue elephant and in my vertigo memory that I did not find different from the cheap teenage stories, linguistically weak and naive in building events. The beginning of the blue elephant gave me a temporary negative impression, from rhetorical expressions that are sometimes lenient and smarter, but it started to dwindle with the progress of the pages of the novel, and it really impressed me with innovative analogies that are not like the absurd Vertigo analogies, until they shine artically and stylist as we near the end. I still have to point out a few minor negatives: / Contradiction: the page of an honest wound on the left hand, a page on the right .. / Some English phrases have errors, which may be typographical .. / Confusion between the vocabulary of the leg and the leg, the humerus and the forearm .. / Excessive use of impulses, intimidation, impulse ... etc. Wrong use, and stylistically monotonous .. / Combining wheat from the flesh of simile, it looked like someone feeds a gold ring with stones from Zalat .. The writer&#39;s style evolved a lot from his first novel, and his rhetorical skills were evident, but they needed linguistic refinement. He had mentioned at the signing ceremony of the novel his reading of the book of jurisprudence Al-Thaalabi, and he meant the jurisprudence of language and it is a small heritage book, despite its importance does not fit our time. The first is that the dictionaries of error and linguistic correctness, the best of which are written by Dr. Ahmad Mukhtar Omar ..

In the middle of the novel I felt a severe psychological fatigue from the psychological struggle that exists within all the heroes, Dostoevsky did not make Raskolnikov a center of the novel but rather made the human psyche a place that everyone shares in a greater or lesser degree; the ideas he presented about feelings and psychoanalysis greatly inspired me and gave me the ability to perceive different aspects And deep inside the human soul.

There is no TV, but there is a TV in the lobby that is constantly viewed by smoking guests. Smoking was not allowed in our room, perhaps it was allowed in other rooms.

On a personal experience: I did not actually inspect Elvis for about two months, due to circumstances beyond my control, in the first days of this I was tense, fanatic, and sensitive, that I missed my whole life, and I was living in a different world, far from my companions and acquaintances, after a week passed, I felt that I was calm and I said God life without a beautiful face I went back to most of the needs I love by following a program with Mama or listening to the radio and using the phone. I ask him about my friends who really loved me. With the first meeting I had with my companions, I was enjoying, and I don&#39;t want to go home, I want to spend the longest time with them, and really happened despite it being a period of exams .. there was no need for my annoyance other than the needs of the people I love and I do not have their phone numbers I mean, Elvis is the only way I see The second need is the needs in my studies that I want to know, and I can only reach them via Facebook. At the first opportunity I had, so I could see people who did not know their news except from Elvis. Also, there are normal words that will be said in return for him, who knows how to influence my meeting with the people I wrote face to face, even though the speech is far from disturbing me. During the absence of Facebook, I was meeting with them, and I really felt that they made me crazy, and that there was no need for me to meet them. The bottom line, if there is any way for me to overcome my needs that I am in, so I can cancel it immediately and take the electronic suicide step:

"I expected the book to be full of scientific, physical and mental evidence of the existence of God ... How was Mustafa Mahmoud, may God have mercy on him, bound and then believed again ... But I found him listing foolish evidence that they inferred about the absence of God and began to refute it and prove their naivety. Here they are the scholars raving about science, but when they pray for what they cannot explain, they conclude their words with a word of chance ... more than a sentence that attracted my attention that God does not infer the existence of, but inferred the existence of things in the presence of God. I do not remember the sentence with the text, but this is its meaning .... God have mercy on a scientist, thinker and writer Mustafa Mahmoud, who God guided many people

"The novel, in its entirety, is good, and was walking in great sequence and new style. But the first thing that entered the entrance of magic and charlatans and the underworld. A novel that took a second course, for myself, I was not loved. The writer, Hosni, said that there is no separation between the knowledge of all of us of love and of myself with his passion for psychology, between magic, sorcery, and the underworld. This is more than something I did not like in the novel but a wonderful writer and I enjoyed the novel and the dust of diamonds and waiting for suspense in

"A wonderful work worth reading. I liked the most important way in which the novel takes us from the beginning of the Mamluks for a year, and the thread that connects all of this is the idea of searching for freedom.

"A written novel from his age means adding my life many times, but it is an embodiment of reality since ancient times, and it does not change for a moment but rather it has become full of hypocrisy and hypocrisy more than before as if hypocrisy is like oxygen no one can live in that life without hypocrisy the novel this course I did a movie but the movie The injustice of the novel is the injustice between it is the idea to be dealt with, and it is the ethics represented by pills that a person draws without touching on the content, but the question here is if the Sebaei is the one who wrote the novel and he has the right then it turns into a movie that did not convey what came in the novel completely this is a difficult thing for sure because Difficult to embody a page narration in a film that lasted an hour and a half, but There are things that brought the film a far cry from what was narrated, so what was the first to shed light on water that came with the narration, as this is not hypocrisy?

"The first note about the novel is that it captures you from the first to the other. Hours I would just want to content myself with what I read and closed, so that they could see other needs, but I was not as much. The novel is really charming. And you live the details of Andalusia and occupy it in the smallest details. The first time read about the fall of Andalusia the way de. I just have one note. I think anyone reading a hundred years of isolation will notice that there is a terrible similarity between the two versions. How to deal with characters and passage from one character to another, and deal with the death of the characters of the novel. Almost until the same period. The events of the novel took nearly a year. At first, I thought the similarity was a coincidence. But when the similarities were met with so many things, I ruled out the chance and thought that Radwa Ashour was intending to do something like a hundred years of isolation. Frankly, I do not know this is sweet or not? We can consider that she appreciated the need to do as great and valuable the Marquise business if that was a good thing. We can consider that the element of imitation is not a good need. I am confused personally. But in the end, it remains that this novel enjoyed me to the max and deserved the stars well

"What a pleasure to give a book five stars and your conscience relieved. How sweet is to live a sincere romantic situation under the auspices of the Romantic Ambassador and her philosopher. The book is a letter filled with a passionate desire and formulated with the best rhetorical images, and this is something expected when the two parties are Al-Rafii, Mai Ziadeh or Marie Ziadeh .. Syrian Christianity with Lebanese origins in relation to her father and Palestinian origins in relation to her mother. And she is a wonderful writer on the Arab level, and she was and still is a model for the free Arab woman who has an audible voice and good opinion .. Some sources mention that she has many lovers, including Al-Rafii, but the most prominent of them is Gibran Khalil Gibran, and she is the only one who declared her love after a year of their relationship. On my opinion of the book:. A love from a third party. This was my feeling, it is very strange that you look at the messages of lovers. It is more surprising that you learn from them how to formulate the meanings that your heart does not conjure up and cannot formulate your pen .. It means my country like this ... One who loves one and I in the spirit of sitting with them like this:. I think the Al-Rafei School in romance is one of its features, innovation and distance from the beaten and common words of lovers lying in a sincere style and feelings of the lunar light .. His creativity is not only prose but sets your eyes on places of poetry what is the most beautiful and the most beautiful and sweetest. In the shadow of the distorted love and the indulgence in describing the charms, wading and studying in it, this book came to restore the joy of the classic love and the feelings swinging between ebb and flow ... between Akouf and Azouf ... between eagerness and separation .. it is a essence in itself and a very enriching reference for young researchers looking Refine their language and feelings .. Note: There is a download link included with the book introduction. And now I leave you with some quotes to elite me too. Interesting reading, God willing

"I finished reading the novel &quot;Butterfly&#39;s Book&quot; by the talented writer, Sherine Sami. Which I think is a wonderful literary energy and talent that has not yet been discovered, although this is normal in the first novel, and I am confident that the next work will achieve a much greater resonance after Sherine made a balance of confidence in the taste of everyone who read the work, and mobilized an audience waiting for her new creativity ... Language: attractive and coherent, indicating a writer who was a good reader in the first place, and not from that prevalent style that decided to write just because he had read a work or two, as the writer seemed to be influenced by the Naguib Mahfouz School in caring for the narration and detailed description, and the use of the smooth dialogue language Simple, closest to colloquial in dialogue .. Characters: Each character has its own language A, her style, and her way of speaking, which confirms that the writer made for each character a file with all the details about her before proceeding to write, so that she does not fall into the trap of mixing between the way she speaks and the way the characters speak in which many authors fall, especially in their first works ... plot Coherent and interconnected. Rhythm: The rhythm could have been more vibrant and active in short some marginal matters and not digressing in them, but there is nothing wrong, because the current rhythm is acceptable and not slow in a very moving way. Cover: One of the most beautiful and coolest covers I have seen in the past three years, and has a magical ability to stick to memory and stick to it no matter how the eye sees after it other covers, as well as its complete suitability to work in a way that makes it difficult to imagine a cover other ... I liked high heroine to work to the extent The disease is with her, because she is the human being that she loved and was not associated with, and she lost and lost with another person, and she is the sister that her older brother did not feel and she strayed, and she is every girl who was a project for a successful human being, but the good intentions were not sufficient to make those dreams come true, and I wished that she had found them before they were lost. To protect her and I hope others do that before it is too late ... What did not satisfy me at work is that, like most Arab women&#39;s literature, despite my reservation to this classification, it often focuses on the pain of the oppressed female victim, but the truth is said that the restriction of the butterfly succeeded in attracting me to its world and forced me to abandon this distress from that problem without paying attention except me and me On the last page, I think Sherine Sami will be smart enough to get out of this cocoon in her new work to navigate other worlds, just as her dear Sherine Hinai succeeded in getting rid of that syndrome. The evaluation of five and awaiting the new work, God willing, for the name will have a big affair in the near future, God willing

"This is a book against the narrow, exclusive, puritan and simplistic concept that reduces the full identity to a single affiliation advocated angrily. Against the widespread, very malicious and very dangerous way of thinking that diminishes identity because it puts men in a prejudiced, sectarian, fanatic, authoritarian and sometimes suicidal position and turns them often into murderers or supporters of murderers. Amin Maalouf calls instead to imagine our identity as being made up of multiple affiliations so once we see in ourselves and in our origins various, accurate, and contradictory intersections, contributions, hybrids and influences until we have a different relationship with others. Amin Maalouf believes that we often exaggerate the impact of religions on peoples, while neglecting the opposite of the influence of peoples on religions and criticizes the widespread opinion in the West, which easily sees in Islam the source of all the evils suffered by the societies that belong to it .. And believes that there is no point in asking what It says the truth of Islam, Christianity or Marxism if we seek answers and not merely to affirm negative or positive prejudices, then we should not be entrusted with the essence of belief but rather with the actions of those who have been relying on it throughout history. He says somewhere else. The twentieth century taught us that there is no liberal doctrine in itself. All beliefs can be deflected, and all can be deformed and all their hands are stained with the blood of communism, liberalism, nationalism, all of the major religions, even secularism. Nobody has a monopoly on fanaticism, and on the contrary, no one monopolizes what is Humanitarian . Finally, the wish made by Amin Maalouf at the end of his book seems very far away, or almost impossible, at least for our time.

"I am sad that the body, as well as the soul, does not have wings flying in the sky, but that one has a permanent ambition that drives him to the perches and forward. Faust the man whose soul always aspires to the highest but cannot endure staying, he is imprisoned in his body and himself .. Faust the person who goes himself down to the world of the earth and desires but he cannot stand survival because his instinct refuses to degenerate .. And between these two oscillates the power of the soul and the strength of the soul and all of them They gravitate to him .. But Faust is the European man who wants to be a part of the upper world never descends, he wants to be an ideal honest family surrounding everything. And I think this is what Goethe criticizes, which causes him to fall down and accompany Satan himself, seducing women, killing and harming them. But with all his crimes, a person insinuates and breaks his fast ... in the night of the Aalborg and Revelation Night Burg, which is a party for the king of the jinn and attended by demons and goblins. And in this chapter Goethe criticizes and analyzes in short terms various philosophies .. He says: Many dreams: The dreams that filled my imagination, have tyrannized to me this time, ie tyranny. And for my life, if all my delusion is now true, then today I am a mad fool. . A man of tangible facts. Being here is a source of my suffering and suffering. For the first time in my life, he showed me not sure of myself, and my faith is about to be shaken. . All of this is the first part of a novel that Goethe has embraced for years and has left us with a lot of smack yet. In the second part, Faustus returns, regrets, and repents to show Adam’s first human .. The translator’s language is good and clear, but he interfered to explain in the footnote the purpose of Goethe and what it means and this I think is confiscation of the reader and this is not his place, and if he wanted to mention that in his introduction or In an independent literary and critical work.

The writer Saud took me on a journey through time and space to a new world I did not come to that moment that I grabbed the pages of the book and I lived completely with all the characters that he created and sympathized a lot with Issa or obsessive about his problem that has no solution .. Being that he does not belong to any country in them and his confusion between Kuwait and the Philippines that he is a Filipino cannot live on this principle, but this half is frequent with his Kuwaiti half .. As I was impressed greatly by his exhaustive research on God Almighty between Many religions .. That opportunity that did not come to many of us by virtue of birth in a particular religion .. which is a blessing Printed by God Almighty .. He unified him with nature and his overwhelming love for it made me as if I smelled the scents of nature and sat under the big mango tree in his grandfather&#39;s garden .. That man who was exhausted by war and framed part of his mind .. Also, the legend of the pineapple mentioned by the writer was As a new piece of information of its kind .. I loved Kuwait, despite its negative aspects, as I liked Egypt .. It removed dust from the human sense inside me towards all human beings; for each of them has an entity, feelings, belonging and circumstances that must be fully respected .. and not treating humans as machines that do not Reason or understanding ... the pleasure of reading in this novel is endless .. it is a masterpiece that every Arab takes pride in ...

"One of the best books written by Omar Taher means after dogs do not eat chocolate along. Omar Taher offers a lot of irony in many situations in Egypt, but in a way that is not vulgar and unpopular, as many people do not do. Of course, his language is easy to mix between colloquial and simple Arabic language without verbal complication and no words. Originally, he needs profound words in any satirical book. I liked very much the first article in the book that was named on behalf of the new Muslims. This was the best article I almost read in my life. It talks about the conditions of new Muslims in the world, and how they rejoice in Starbucks and KFC that is on campus, and so on. I liked a lot of articles like why I encourage Zamalek, I liked persistence in principle, and I liked the guardianship of Egyptian protections for her daughter&#39;s control of marital nest:. The book is, in general, very beautiful and entertaining. You can save on one rule

"The least thing I would describe the novel as is a masterpiece in every word in a metaphor. This is another story that I read for Nour Abdel-Majid, despite the separation. I do not know how come this is ?? The novel has everything in it. It is a masterpiece. The style of the novel. I liked it very much, Medhat Abdul Rahman, with his intelligence, kindness, wisdom and way of looking at the problems, I liked his devotion to his wife and his tenderness, Ali Shahira, and how he stood by her in every need, I liked his generosity and loyalty to them and his affection for them, every thing in it I liked. Awowi Ali Raouf was upset because of what he did. He was an example of a faithful, faithful, loyal and faithful man. She was more than famous because of her method of revenge against Raouf. The novel influenced me rigidly and made me do many things, the most important of which is what Baha said: There are things that are not forgotten .. There is no forgiveness nor forgiveness. But we must continue our lives and try to build all that is destroyed and stand again and we look forward. Hard to tell a masterpiece .. Thanks to Nour Abdul Majeed for the second time:

"..,. ,. .. .. My friend, who has a lot of confidence in her opinion, told me, this book is a real treasure and I would like it if everyone read it, and I did not expect the fact that the young author has a deep knowledge to write in such deep thought. The words of my friend encouraged me to read this book, and because I could not go to the library, I uploaded an electronic copy of the book and started reading the first chapter and formed a general idea about it, and because my specialization in Islamic studies found ease in understanding a lot of what he mentioned, the majority of his articles are religious intellectual dialogues, and I found them Most of them are in agreement with what we studied, but some phrases and points I wished if I reviewed them more, and some of them are general observations such as his inference that the Arabs honored women except after Islam and inferred with Khadija’s trade and poetic status and the strength of the opinion of Hind bint Ataba, and it is known that these women were like that before Islam and increased Islam attributed Status. .,. ,. ,. I found that this book is a scientific mental response based on Islamic visions of many questions of the mind in this era in an easy and easy way. Sultan Al-Musa in this book is flying us in his own journey of research and learning, starting from his first position with the first atheist he saw in his life to the conclusion of his book that summarizes There is a way for everyone who has a question inside, saying:. . ,. Trust, man, that knowledge and work will never come to you on a plate of gold. If you do not seek after it, do not dream that one or both of them will come to you. ,. ,. This book is suitable for the secondary stage and above, this stage is the most frequently asked questions of young people, I liked the fact of his way of presenting the issue of women, and many others, ,. ,. The book is easy, simple, the style is about two hundred pages, and as far as I know it is about fifty riyals. I expect that I will buy it soon, so I am not satisfied with the electronic version and I think it will benefit me as a reference later. ,. ,. Thank you Sultan Al-Mousa for your book

Hadith Qudsi is the focus of the book .. It may pass on some as any hadith. But its meaning is great and needs to be paused and examined ..

And how it regained its glory again with Abdullah bin Yassin. He who started the bond with the Senegal River and five who answered his call to pray. Then the country would expand. By Yusuf bin Tashfin, Emir of the Muslims and Nasir al-Din. For me, the first part of the book is a supplement to Azazel. Defining me in Arianism. Also complementary to the Granada Trilogy.

"I love these novels, which keep me tight for them until I finish them in a few hours, no matter how many pages there are, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s no wonder that I love Egyptian literature in general. :. Yesterday I saw a scene from the open door movie, especially the scene was a night reading of the message of Hussein, the message full of love, support and hope .. When I realized that this narration is the same as the movie, the decision came quickly and must be read .. The novel deals with the political events that took place in Egypt From the mid-forties to the tripartite aggression, as well as Laila&#39;s life and its progression from childhood to boyhood for maturity .. The novel is full of revolution, enthusiasm and questions that undoubtedly passed on to many girls: Why am I not? What is different between me and the young man? Why this inferior view? Through the events of the novel, the idea of origins, customs and traditions that cannot be departed is always repeated .. He shows us many examples, about salon marriage or the interest and what it entails for the girl, and about the traditional eastern man who sees his partner only as a dependent and submissive person and about the people who always defy their society with all His norms ... Leila understands the secret, reaches the door and opens it .. And as she finally arrives and understands herself .. It is a beautiful novel, and her thoughts are so, it is unfortunate that you never feel that she wrote in the sixties, the situation is not the same ..

If you replaced Kuwait with any other Arab country, the novel would not lose its credibility and our racism against each other as human beings.

Imagine a time and place in which people from different countries, cultures, religions and backgrounds work to discover new knowledge, understand more about the world and come up with new innovations that they trade with each other with the utmost openness and freedom.

Juan is a lot of details and artistic painting, and I love the details and my look is very good.

A full court, despite its shortness, its poems do not depart from the subject of the hour, then take with each hand a poem to teach you a new meaning for the hour, for hands, for the matrix numbers, for the face of the wall, for the philosophy of time, colonialism, politics, and cheating boards ...

I felt the writer’s surrender to this unfortunate reality without trying to change it. I see the novel from the same angle from which Hussein al-Zahar sees society and observing him from the window of his dark room in terrible silence and finite precision, then trying to change it in a mistake ... a little mistake, we fix with it the biggest mistakes ... and with this a person gradually loses himself with every small mistake to To become the biggest mistake society has ever known ...

"Initial review. The creator, Dr. Hussein El-Sayed, was able to compete strongly with the godfather in the durability and quality of the terror plot. Smooth, wonderful language, well-informed, and abundant information, which means a lot that compels me to run the internet next to the novel to search and learn from the wonderful magical information. The best character ever is Dr. Mohamed Shaheen, a character is a very ingenious and delicious mixture and grains between Dr. Rifaat Ismail Mao behind the nature, and between the arrogant and well-informed doctor of Safari novels, Dr. Arthur Shelby. And frankly, a great mix. The most wonderful thing is that the character appeared in the following novel, the black sheikh with maturity and the most beautiful details. Thank you very much for this delicious horror meal. And for the rest, God willing

"If you open the novel, you start reading the first pages in it. For a moment, you think that it is an ordinary novel that will tell a little about the suffering of a young man and the Egyptian revolution, and how this young man was affected by it .... But wait .. go deeper into the novel a little bit, then you will see that it is one of the books that may change your outlook for a lot and a lot of things .. you find in the novel that hidden terror .. things that you might really think could happen from what might make you panic and this is one of the writer&#39;s genius points .. the novel was divided between the ruled and the ruler and then both ... she gave us all the details about Khaled greeting the smallest details without the slightest Boredom ... a great writing style that makes you feel the same person and what you mean Behold, as if you were in your mind ... Then we started talking about the ruler, that wonderful character in my estimation, for the first time I do not favor good for evil, but I remain throughout the novel motivated to end it without any hatred for any of the characters ... Salah Al-Najmi is a solemn figure despite everything the writer created In its creation from the ground up. A strong personality eager to learn is pathetic and dazzled together. It captures you with all its events ... The scene of the battle in the novel is a majestic scene and the author described it with precision and magnificence as if you are above the fullest behind the goodness of the state you see the battle ... I thought that the writer would take the revolution like any of the writers who must To pass on the revolution the honorable passage in their books as a kind of rooshness, but I mistook again the revolution is the focus of the novel .. Egypt and Egyptians are the most important things in the novel .. where I mentioned the most important characteristics and the most hateful pests. I spoke and described completely how the Egyptians are exploited from all sides and followed by an end that may be the solution to what we are in .... Finally .. It is really exhausting novels .. But you find pleasure in all your trouble .. Enjoy the pain as delighted by Salah Al-Najmi. So fear their anger and do not ignite a fire that only their Creator extinguishes ... so that they may be victorious with them, they are the best of the earth’s soldiers ...

"Love is nothing but a state of loss of self-confidence in which sublimation is portrayed to us, and it is only a compensation for that deficiency. With this theory, the book made me come up with new perceptions of situations that emptied the soul, which I cannot explain, and after that I was able to overcome them and gain more control over such feelings. The book needs in-depth reading from my point of view, frequent pauses, connectivity, and internal discourse critical of the writer&#39;s opinion and the feelings of the soul. I have to admit to myself that the book took me out of an internal psychological conflict after an emotional trauma and made me aware of the steadfastness which is the truth that I believe in reading therapy

I was very surprised when I learned that many call Rosy that he is secular and secular, as far as I know: He separates religion and the world. This is the opposite of what he does in my opinion.

His hero Aamir, who represents every human being in us, and who did not get Imran himself except in the midst of the greater wandering. We are all Aamir who used to beat the liver of the earth to ask for gold, but he was searching for his absent heart in its hollow. He was hitting the earth without mercy, crucifying himself as we were together. Gold is in the heart of fallow, and by it he finds light in himself, even after a while .. The writer moved in flexibility and smoothness to the fluctuations of the different soul by its delinquency by obedience to it and presented in strength to that genie that we fear collectively and is facing ourselves presented this through easy and sound language and the idea of the novel is very strong and passion is overwhelming and the narration Distinctive and filled with genius phrases and phrases close to oneself and informed What is in it is that it will touch a part of every human soul and present images of those distant depths, and the end is distinguished by being appropriate and attractive, as each soul ends with an end that fits with what it is filled with .. It will remain the truest author of what the author wrote, but Dr. Mustafa&#39;s writings are characterized by a strong sense and symbolism characterized by two things . First, it respects the reader&#39;s mindset and makes him think a lot. Symbolism is a color of writing that calls for the realization of the mind. Second, it makes him leave his imagination unleashed, envisioned and thinks in his own way, so you find ten people who each imagine their own connotations and their own point of view. The writer hired them through his characters and places of events in an excellent way. .. And the author possesses that character that makes you aware of his writings from all the colors of writing, and the ordinary will not be his creativity. The best is that it is only a beginning ... Personally, I learned from them that the end is only due when we have made the last of our love as happiness or the last of what we have From the purity of Ali or another of our greed and greed as a whole who seeks money a And what we have to seek to know God as the end of Amer.

I immediately refrained from many books and refrained from acquiring many of them for several reasons that were established after many visits to these commercial libraries: What is permanently observed in it is the abundance of nausea and absurdity in the Arab cultural product, from publications and books. It is, in addition to its small and weak ratio compared to European and American countries, this little is dominated by aggregation, imitation, copying and banality .. The price of prices is not tolerated by the largest proportion of shoppers and even members of the class Medium compared to an average sized book is not worth all that high amount. The Internet has enriched many books such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, books of information and the like, there is no need to purchase these books and spend huge amounts of money on it, and there is something that sings them in electronic ways easier .. Having a long row of books awaiting reading in my library and my home, there is no need to multiply from other books, But just a simple renewal and additions here and there ... I finished a medium-length tour of the library with four books. I was surprised at the accountant that they were all inadvertently novels, although I do not care much about them, but I balance them with many other cultural and intellectual books ..

And to Qusay&#39;s corner there had been since Anis Mansour and his days came in the Akkad Salon, but I did not join him in that unique session. And me with him a bitter pause later. In a heterogeneous manner, Bill Gates and a lengthy technical material were with us, a study from me for one of the endless Microsoft technical certificates .. I was confused about where to start and what I commend and who I will triple to him but the opinion settled from the subconscious of the wonderful late Yahya Hakki and his unique Qandil or Hashem In which he made his reputation as a work of the most important works of the short or slightly long story in the twentieth century .. We are here talking about a story written since the forties of the last century and you have always heard about it and read a lot of praise and praise in the books and cultural and literary circulation circulated, and perhaps the most important of those singled out in criticism in That time with a wonderful article is Al Adi By the martyr Syed Qutb, may God have mercy on him, then added to his valuable book: Books and Characters. Until the beginning of this article, it will captivate you and inform you that a flood of praise will spell out this story and this fictional creativity. When Sayyid Qutb opens this article to:. Oh Yahya Hakki ... where are you, man ... I wish I had the executioner&#39;s whip, lazy creator. . Syed continues to list my talents and creativity and compare them to Timur and others .. When he mentions that my right is less productive compared to others, but it is distinguished by type, quality, and talent in this little .. As for Timur, for example, he writes, writes and writes, and he must come across a good thing in this much that he writes. I also remember what the late scholar Mahmoud Shaker Abu Fahr wrote in his valuable book, False and Asmar about that humble man who visited him one day for the first time in his house with a writer and then contacted him later asking him for permission to be his friend and to visit him continuously that was the humble man Adeeb Yahya My right, since they have become close friends since then, and some sources attribute the professorship to Shaker and the apprentice to my right to death, may God have mercy on her in the last decade of the twentieth century .. So all these introductions that I have read, heard and seen about Yahya Hakki and Qandil or Hashem made something inside of me Great about this writer and his production so maybe p Some think that I have made the issue of ruling on it, and it is an easy issue, and it has a look and a blurring upon it. However, really despite all that, I was missing a lot, many, and not the inspector like the informant and anyone who tasted the custom. Every wonderful description about Qandil or Hashem and the smoothness and aesthetics of the language and style of Yahya Hakki Al-Qasasi does not all enrich that description from the moments of his reading and taste. For the first time, I read a story on many of my reading of this literary genre with this wonderful language, the smoothness of words and the splendor of the method that penetrates into the souls of the soul and does its act, for when you read to revive my right and specifically Qandil or Hashem, it is as if you drink water, or sip honey with its ingenuity in language love and draw pictures with ease and elegance Verbal grace .. Qandeel Umm Hashem’s story revolves around that young Ismail, whose rate does not qualify him for admission to local Egyptian colleges, and his father decides to send him abroad in Britain in order to complete his studies and return to a doctor that the family is proud of despite the hardships of distance, separation and financial pressure on the family because of this only With distress .. that villager turns to another man in Britain who bites, befriends, breaks, and also succeeds in his studies and returns to an ophthalmologist, but he is a doctor who revolts against customs, traditions, sophistication, and amulets, defying and praising against the current trend to dare and carry his stick and smash a lamp Hashim, that lamp suspended over the shrine of the lady takes the poor from Its oil to treat their patients with all their diseases and offer gifts and gifts to him .. The result was that the simple people of the neighborhood revolted against him and beat him until he nearly died to be rescued by his former colleague, the guard of the mausoleum and his shepherd .. The young doctor then decides to treat his fiancée, the ruminants in her eyes with his modern form, in which he has recovered dozens in a Britain. But her condition gets worse day by day until she almost loses sight .. In the end the young man reaches the stage of reconciliation between his youth and his traditions and returns to visit the shrine .. The shrine of the lady is not dispensed with his modern treatment .. This is the story in short, which will not make you need to read it of course, but The last sentence, perhaps, summarizing the whole idea of the story, which is dealing with crises of interaction between East and West. Between the backward East that has just looked for the glamor of Western civilization. Between the sight of the West and the insight of the East. Between the mind of the first world, and the spirit of the third world. Between decades and centuries of eastern backwardness and delay, and recent years of superiority and terrible western scientific progress .. This was the preoccupation of intellectuals and writers of preoccupation in the half of the twentieth century with the era of colonialism and the end of its end, so people were three types :. A class that satisfied the West with its advantages and disadvantages and decided to merge with it and completely strip it of its identity .. It classified completely closed to itself and closed the windows with many arguments until those withered and died .. And an intermediate class between this and that closed the doors as it all opened the windows and received the new with its advantages and disadvantages ... Perhaps this last class It is what Yahya Hakki, may God have mercy on him, tried to display and address through the story of this rebellious and confused young man between his traditions and his society who was looking at him with contempt and disgust and then reconciled and appreciated after that after he realized that there is no mind for the West without a soul for the East .. Is this conflict over? I do not think so, and still we are witnessing many civilized traumas who first went to the homes of the West, its universities and institutes to send his speeches from there despising its societies, universities, students, and curricula ... not reconcilable neither with himself nor with his family repeating the same mistakes and negatives. May not benefit his community, even in the end, what he learned and studied. He benefited himself .. quotes. Yahya Hakki formulates and casts all of this with unparalleled linguistic creativity and intellectual creativity. Look at him describing Ismail&#39;s arrival in the steamboat to Alexandria after he finished his studies: Why did the ships deliberately make this reluctance to reach, and what was the fastest in separation? Anyone who takes refuge in the arboretum remains a captive of his life. He describes him as Britain and described his girlfriend Mary: The acquaintance has a collision between the two characters, which comes out victorious or loser, the acquaintance has a meeting, and the friendliness is up to the future. He who seeks the morals of angels is overcome by the morals of beasts. These eastern emotions are vicious and hated because they are impractical and unproductive, and if they are stripped of benefit, there remains nothing but their weakness and humiliation. Rather, these emotions have strength in secrecy, not in disclosure. And the human soul does not find its strength and then its happiness unless it separates from the masses and confronts them. As for integration, it is weak and resentful. Here, it describes the poor people, and perhaps it describes all the Arab peoples: What is the benefit of jihad in a country like Egypt and with a people like the Egyptians, who have lived in humiliation for centuries, so taste and taste it? This is an old people and returned to their childhood, if there was someone to lead them, they would have jumped to manhood again in one step. The road is familiar and glory is old, and memories remain. The lover does not measure or compare, and if the comparison is entered from the door and the love passes through the window, here he describes how Ismail reached the stage of conciliation and reconciliation with himself and his community: Where are you, O Light that I have been absent forever? Welcome to you, the blurring of my heart and eyes was gone. I now understood what was hidden from me .. There is no knowledge without faith. He stuck to his knowledge of his spirit and foundation, and left exaggeration in machines and means. He relied on God, then on his knowledge and hands, so God blessed his knowledge and hands. There is not everything in you and me ... there is beauty, secrets, fun and splendor. Al-Saeed is one of her feelings. Then you have to. Between the migration season and the jellyfish. Perhaps Yahya Hakki, son of that neighborhood, did not intend to return to bless those shrines and their oils, but he wanted to convey the idea of reconciling science with faith, the science of the West with the faith of the East, and ended it with a happy, bright ending .. Here comes to our minds the story of the migration season to the north by Tayeb Saleh. It deals with the same idea and revolves its contexts around the same topic and the same way with that young man leaving from the Sudanese village submerged to Britain to study literature to return after the same period of years in Qandil or Hashem and events continue .. but the end of the season

"And in the shadows of the Qur’an, I learned that there is no place in this existence for blind chance or for occasional gesture: for everything we have created in so far ... and created everything in appreciation of it .. and every matter of wisdom. But the deep wisdom of the unseen may not be revealed to the short humanistic view. . Love those who emigrated to them and do not find anything in their chests what they gave. The history of all mankind was not known as a collective accident, as was the incident in which Ansar welcomed migrants. With this kind love. With this generous effort. With this satisfied participation, and with this race to harbor and the potential burden. Even to tell that no immigrant landed in Dar Ansari except by lot. Because the number of those who want to house crowds is more than the number of immigrants. Life in the shadows of the Qur’an is a blessing that only the one who knows it knows, a blessing that raises, blesses and praises life. It is not belief in wish, but what is revered in the heart and its sincerity is action. . The meaning of Islam: surrender and obedience to God’s law, and the meaning of not surrendering to this law, and the adoption of other law in any part of life, is a refusal to recognize the divinity and authority of God, whether this rejection by the tongue or indeed without saying. Do not be afraid that you are the highest. You are right and wrong with them. You have the creed and they have the craft.

Suffice it to say that it is completely unrealistic. Then it moved from the tragedy of saft al-Laban with all its people, streets and homes, to its roofs and sands. It has taken from those paradoxes, different lives, and the injustice applied to us only and not as a wick that ignited the spark of the revolution. The author also managed to describe how all the people of the nation coalesced against corruption and injustice. She made it very clear who was against this revolution and also what might these people do in order to get what they want. The semen is very hard, especially the residents of Saft al-Laban.

"The book is very sweet, I don’t like short stories, pure because I don’t live, live in it and merge in it, but I felt in the book that every story merges easily with it and lives the narration style sweet, all the time. It has the same spirit and they must remain in the same book. You will not feel that there is a need for a possible increase in God. If it fails, we will not feel it. Almost all the stories are strong, and each one has an influential role, although the connection between them is strong. The most story related to the metro has taken me to a world that already exists, but we do not see it. Life is the role every day. The metro is the people. We meet it with their details, but we do not scratch our minds of them. The reading does not feel very pure. This is the first book to provide a very professional book.

"My first experience with Kundera, and certainly not the last, will be with him for other long sessions. His style of the novel is very unique, the way the narration and its overlapping is terrible. He says the novel in one of the passages by Kundera himself: It means that the novel must be unquote. Meaning that they are all integrated. And another point about the difference between the road and the road. On the road, the road itself does not matter, but it is important to get from point A to point B. Or the path is its importance as a path, and the path itself is to be an end. The sense is not just access. This thing summarizes his style with this novel. It does not matter where it begins, how it ends and what will happen. By reading it you will know that every page and perhaps every sentence of its own has value. And this is his view of the art of the novel, it is not like a movie waiting for what will happen, but rather you must feel that for every moment and every page there is something itself and a goal. ... I will definitely have other sessions with Kundera when I devote myself a little

"I loved this novel very much, and I enjoyed it a lot as I gradually moved between its seasons from Claudio&#39;s childhood to his maturity, and I liked more that it was that simple, like depicting a routine, almost life-free routine. Among the lines I felt a lot that I had traveled to Spain, where Claudio lived, he started with the city he used to live in, the neighborhood, the street, the house, his room and the fig tree. I lived with him and with interest in the details of his life and stages and attracted me to that more, being a painter and a lover of reading, and contented himself with his small surroundings.

"Here, I was struck by a poet cry that had brought pain alive, so I cried with it and breathed pain and revolution over the spiritual, psychological and physical imprisonment I tasted .. Fatima, with my own eyes, was not rebellious against religion but rebellious against the male slapping hand that sanctifies the man and makes the woman a slave. If there is a deficiency in us, then what is perfect for you, and perfection was for God alone? The woman’s knowledge and work is not a denial or a shame, even if our arrogant orientation insists on making it so .. I am fascinated by the prose poem and more fascinated by her love for her ... Buthina’s talk about poetry and writing in general is a sweet torment like a beautiful spinning with his thicket .... an easy loose language that is prose A caravan that cares about holding it, so what you keep escaping from your fingers is a challenge and a bravery. I did not give the fifth star because I wished that Fatima had defeated Falcon with her headscarf and commitment at the end of the novel.

"Those who raise up about Islamic education have overlooked the most important aspect of it .... The tragedy of Muslims lies in the fact that they neglected the science of faith and its path, which is the innate introduction to the Book of God. Faith is not inherited. And the discerning of the educators sends those who pledge them on that journey, looking and thinking and thinking, so if they believed their belief was based on the principles and experiences established in their conscience, and increased the grace of reason in appreciation and use ..

This book helped me in drawing the milestones of my journey and setting its initial cognitive framework, contenting myself with some of what I singled out in detail and detailing it in some of the chapters, and looking for what is more beautiful in its narration from other chapters. My reading of parts of the book also helped me more than once to determine what would require me more research and study in my own leg .. The book in its entirety is a compilation and composition of what was written by the former, the writer collects his parts and comments on them in a sequence that began with. Determining the path of the mind to know the divine self. Then he presented a set of major cosmic phenomena that indicate God. Then the significance of these phenomena indicates the names and attributes of God and the linking of what the mind has attained with what we have reported with the transfer .. Then comparing the Islamic belief with other beliefs of religions and the attitudes of philosophers .. The book was as if it were a summary of the research of its owner in this aspect and extracts of what he reached in his research journey is .. I think A good and happy start for another trip, starting from here. To reassure my heart . ... God is the helper:

With a giant pool, a heated children&#39;s pool, a nice waterslide and an outdoor jacuzzi pool with sea views. My luxurious sea view room was very impressive, and the housekeepers and reception staff in particular were very pleasant. My only major problem was with the quality of food and service in the main restaurant Ramses. The food never reflects the quality of this hotel. It was below average, without luxury decks and with very poor service. My package included bed and breakfast, and I&#39;m mainly talking about breakfast here. Anyway, I tried the food in this restaurant at dinner, and it was very bad. In any case, the Italian food in Mezzaluna was good. My other minor problem was the TV channels. Although they have an acceptable range of channels, I tried to add two MBC MBC Action which are essential in the Middle East, but I could not. They told me that the channel list is fixed and cannot be changed. Another minor problem, the shuttle bus that visits Naama Bay three times a day for free, which was a wonderful thing times is not flexible. Morning, four o&#39;clock in the evening and then in the evening there should be at least a bus at six, seven or eight in the evening for Naama Bay, in my opinion in general, the resort is a great destination for those seeking relaxation.

"There are many visions and many writings, confirming that Islam recommends good deeds to women and depicts them metaphorically with fluffy flasks calling for attachment to them, so it places them under the guardianship of the man, making him a degree over the woman, but he is higher than it is because he is the one whom God has preferred and he who inherits weakness or Everyone, who is complete with reason, religion and religion, and his highest position is not only religious, but also his religious woman in the hereafter, and he also has other women: Hur eye is like the pearls of the hidden, did not touch them before man and no jean, whenever he assumed their virginity Aden virgins, and there is no consolation here for the women There is no room, therefore, for their succession on earth from God. It does not make sense for God to represent a woman on earth, whatever her position .. So her position, whatever it may be, should degrade the position of a man, at least to a degree, and by more than one degree sometimes, and by all degrees often. Our saying of honoring Islam for women is the biggest lie that does not exist ...

"Four dialogues for which Plato Socrates specializes, the dialogues in their entirety are wonderful, evoke the mind and urge him to think, research and ask, all dialogues begin with introductions on the tongue of Socrates and end with either negative results to criticize one of the misconceptions from Socrates ’viewpoint especially Plato or positive to support an idea they believe in .. I like in the introductions that the repeated delivery is very much in the responses of those who are interviewed by Socrates, which appears in the repetition of a group of vocalizations. Examples of yes it is correct. What I might imagine and other amusing signs The full introduction of Socrates’s propositions and in my imagination if there was some objection to these introductions with logical views as it is the Socrates ’style, it could have been the product of the richer dialogues, with the exception of some responses from Simias and Sebaceus in the Phaedo dialogue, so they had some objections that contributed to enriching those The interview a lot .. There are also the introductions that the translator, clever Naguib Mahmoud recounted for each interview separately. I think that it is better to have subsequent comments for each conversation in order not to lose on the reader the pleasure of the interviews themselves .. The Mutafiroun dialogue most of its results are negative to criticize certain ideas about piety and I would have preferred The result of any Abate to define piety in the eyes of Socrates and Plato .. The defense dialogue is better to call it pleading and not the dialogue because Socrates dwells on it in defense of himself and there was no dialogue except in the narrowest limits .. The dialogue of the Qataris I liked and disagreed with it in only one side is when I imagine the laws and blame him for He escaped the death sentence in a hypothetical dialogue in which the laws accused him of treason because he was satisfied with them and accepted them even if he was sentenced after that to flee from their rule, and the difference between me here is that he does not escape from them or from their rule, but if he had accepted to flee then he escapes from the injustice of the applicable law And not from them, how many valid laws are fulfilled Dam from the misuse of its applicants, because the effect of Socrates escaping at the time was not by him from the breach of laws in anything, and this is my opinion. The last dialogue, which is the discussion of Fidon, is the most beloved and most enjoyable of the conversations to myself, as Plato created it on the tongue of Socrates in proving the immortality of the soul, as I liked the idea of a succession of souls on the bodies, according to which the soul after death awaits in the lower world until it is authorized to be chained to the body New, and thus, the one soul rotates over several bodies in many times, and the idea of learning and knowledge in its reality is nothing but a reminder of what the soul has acquired in its first world and in the lower world, it is a truly inspiring idea that made me wonder about what kind of spirit inhabited me who was in the past, and made me Also imagine that spirits It is only a very limited number that alternates and regenerates in the bodies in an endless cycle, and the dialogue also raised the idea of succession of opposites that Plato believed a lot. In the end the book is creamy and worth reading again

The book focuses specifically on the concept and origins of the wilayat al-faqih theory and its primary role in the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran at the hands of Khomeini ... a book that is neutral. It also provides a remarkable traceability to the evolution of the theory of wilayat al-faqih historically and politically. It is considered an introduction to understanding Iranian politics and the principle of wilayat al-faqih. Then it shows the meaning of the guardianship of the jurist and the role of Imam Khomeini in developing this theory and the arrival of the system of guardianship of the jurist to power and the exclusion of all parties and other political currents where the line of disagreement and the origin of governance according to the theory of guardianship of the jurist: God is the Messenger the Messenger text the Imam Public Prosecutor of the Jurist. And since the existence of the Ahl al-Bayt is no longer clear, and since the scholars are the heirs of the prophets, then the Shi’ite religious establishment is responsible for leading the Islamic nation represented by the wilayat al-faqih.

"One is confused about the classification of this novel. Her name may sound like a romantic novel. And with the beginning of the novel, we find events enveloped in mystery. And with penetration into the events of the novel more we find wonderful human glimpses. The novel that sparked my curiosity to read more works of this creative writer. A novel that explores the depths of the human psyche with its problems, ambitions, ambiguity and suffering. Your problems may lead you to despair, hopelessness, suicide. But only you can change the course of his life to where he wants, even if it seems difficult to change. Even if fate seems to manipulate you and lead your life completely towards a certain path. The problems, suffering and pain presented by the writer in the novel by its characters. Which they were able to overcome with will and determination. It makes you wonder: Can a person go through worse than this? How if we despair and turn away and melt our will? . Shots in it and various scenes made me cry. I cry because some of her messages shocked me in my heart. As if written specifically for me ... the style of the writer is beautiful and likenesses as well. The choice of names in the novel was successful because I hate long names and do not memorize them:. Because I love you ... Mark Layla told her about his isolation and suffering. Nikon told her repeatedly to Mark with her tongue, her heart, and her deed. Effie told her to Connor with her actions and future that she had put in his hands. Connor told her to Effie by standing by her side and not giving up. Five stars with appreciation

Round trip around the world. A journey in history ... from the fall of Granada to the conflict between the Mamluks and the Ottomans in Egypt. From the heyday of Rome to its downfall at the hands of heretical Lutherans. The journey of a human life he called his family Hassan bin Muhammad Al-Wazzan and he was called by the father of the Vatican John Lyon Medici. A person known in Africa as Rumi and known in Rome as an African. His life was not perfect, as in most books, through which pictures of Amin Maalouf know life as it really is, life in reality and on earth, as God created it and as it has estimated for us. A life in which happiness coincides with sadness and calamities comes after, followed by relief and flight from God’s destiny to God’s destiny. And we realize in the end that God is arresting us with the right, extending it to us. .. Hassan or Leon concluded his life book with a compass to his son, it is one of the most beautiful things that were said, and if the father had not given his son any other, he would have stopped him. Wherever you are, people will want to explore your skin and your prayers, so be careful not to tickle their instincts, my son, and beware not to give in to the crowd, so you are Muslim, Jew or Christian, they should please you as you are or lose you. And when the minds of people waving to you, tell yourself the land of God, wide and spacious, which is his hand and heart.

"Political philosophy is a book in the depth of philosophy, history and civilization that dives between the solid dualism between the foundations of monotheism and polytheism and the loose dualism, even if it did not give it its full right, because it is a theoretical deconstructive book between faith and disbelief. It is a small book. The contemporary reader and Muslim generally feel the importance of the theoretical dismantling effort presented by Al-Masiri in the first part of partial and comprehensive secularism in particular. And pushes the Islamic to search and learn about the branch of ontology or existentialism because it is a philosophy that expresses a gap in the entire Western civilization.

"It seems to me from reading the other comments that I am. I did not notice the dimensions of the plot. As others understood it, it seems to me that some did not pick up the primary goal that Mitchell tried to reach .... I will try to clarify this point and what I understand from the book, then I will talk about my impression of the book .. I will start with what I understood; the book basically talks about The philosophy of colonial rule, neither the history of colonial events nor its final outcome, and for this reason the author spoke in the introduction about the philosophies of Jacques Derrida and Michel Vaucault in. This philosophy is based on two principles: the first is a high degree of representation, that is, the use of signs on meanings that are not physically present, for example, the organization of the new European-style neighborhoods in Cairo and Rabat was a symbol of the existence of a precise system, different and separate from the buildings and streets It is the article of the organization itself, and the old neighborhoods have been preserved to symbolize the lack of order, in contrast with the new neighborhoods .. The second basis: It is the principle of permanent control, that everyone be under supervision, without the observation authority being observed or visible. What I see and understand is that these two principles are part of modern systems of government in general, so the introduction of new army systems and forced recruitment The one who started with Muhammad Ali was not a conspiracy but a transfer of the prevailing systems in Europe, as well as education systems and the architecture of cities and villages, and the brutality with which this matter was made was part of this, perhaps forced labor during the era of Muhammad Ali and Ibrahim his son Ziada and Diligence from them .. This is not a justification for these methods in any way, but an attempt to understand the reason behind it, and Muhammad Ali and the workers of Tawfik and the British attempt to transform Egypt to serve its economy were motivated by this approach, so their solution was to transfer the European systems of government with its philosophy .. Follow this of course Attempts to change culture, religion, language, and literature, bad faith cannot be excluded from it, and those who rise up to address this These are attempts, including Mustafa Kamel, who attacked Qasim Amin in the matter of women&#39;s emancipation, despite his conviction of some of the principles of this system, as it appeared in his talk about methods of education .. Attempting to implement this philosophy of government in our country led to the emergence of this collision, so the writer applied the theories of Derrida To clarify the weakness of this philosophy .. This is what I understood from the writer&#39;s intent, and the damage that occurred to Egypt was not only due to the application of this system, except for the impact of the same on Western countries. The system of oppression that we suffer now is partly the result of this philosophy. As for the main reason, it is the fact that the military and the rest of the state in general agree on corruption and injustice, as if it is a religion that has ... As for my impression of the book, it is difficult to define it. The book raised more questions in my mind than answers, and it is a commendable point in it, especially since these questions converged with other questions that I was thinking about the nature of these regulations. Two shortcomings I took on this edition and the book: Despite the quality of the translation to some extent, I found some spelling errors and punctuation, especially in the recent chapters .. Some parts of the book could have been presented in an easier language.

All the characters were carefully and carefully crafted carefully and accurately .... even though you may be mistaken in their names in the first ... .. the reason can be this narration style that transports you from one important task to another .. you are interested in the other in less than seconds and you forget your eagerness to know about an event In the first ... the way to present events is new, but enjoyable ... by living in a world and then moving you to another smoothly and then to another and so on.

"It is unfortunate that the enemies of Islam know its ability and the Muslims do not know it. They knew from the beginning of the call that Islam is an invasive religion of its nature that is rejected only by those with souls, it is a religion consistent with the pure common sense that broke the right and did not contaminate the disease of arrogance .. it is a religion that addresses the human mind and appreciates and respects it. And he seeks the supremacy of the human spirit, which always seeks to find something metaphysical related to it in order to fill the void within it, as he does not distance himself from the fools of Jews and Christians who own nothing of their religion except to convince his adherents that they only have to believe in crucifixion and salvation, otherwise there is no there Something about peace, s Blood for man is a complete system of religion and world, and it always pushes man to ask and research not only to believe in what is said without realizing his mind .. Hence, conspiracies have been woven for him from the first moment in which he commanded his prophet to crack what he commanded and warn his close clan, since the war was fierce ever since. Now and for more than a year, we have witnessed that the war does not end since the invasion of Badr, passing the wars of apostasy, and what the old and modern Crusades were about us far away ... Our religion, and not to our race, are today fighting those who are sons Our skin speaks in our tongues and they condemn our religion, but they are a dagger in the back of Islam. There is no doubt that those who sold themselves to the Crusader and Judaic ambitions brought about I do not say in Islam, but in the Muslims of defeats what the enemies of Islam failed to do for centuries, so we had to face these and our war with them before our battle began With others, the class must first be cleansed before the battle begins ... and the question that is always repeated remains for this hatred of another ???. The answer is no, as these people realize that it is a battle, and the end result is that only one must win. When do we realize that ?????

"After reading a novel, I knew how to master the writing of the novel by mixing the literary and political styles together at the hands of the English writer George Orwell .. a novel that diverges in the depth of advanced societies, rooted in it and in its dictatorial system with an exciting constitutional constitutional template, was able to predict the future future of peoples, the matter What distinguished her among the world’s political narratives .. And if Orwell’s writing was not an interesting pleasure, I would not have fled to his other narrative, which is rich in definition, Animal Farm, because I am not one of those who really love political subjects. And it became clear to me that even if the purpose of the novel is similar to the subject, only each one It is a masterpiece in its own right that does not resemble a mind Other .. Animal Farm. In the content:. Those who read Orwell&#39;s biography and his clear political positions understand exactly as he submits himself that this novel has its satirical purpose, mocking communism and the Stalinist regime that ruined the concept of socialism in Orwell&#39;s opinion. Orwell, who fought Stalin in the atmosphere of World War II, came to describe this situation with a story, let me say, everyone can read and fully absorb it .. A farm that varies in its animals from pigs, dogs, horses, ducks, chickens, etc...the owner of the human is Jones She succeeds in draining it away from the farm, to take control of her own leadership. Between the pig Snowball and the other Napoleon, there are disagreements over the leadership of the farm and the fulfillment of its affairs. The turning point in the story takes place, where Napoleon can defeat Snowball in a violent fight when he feels the latter is victorious over him. This battle was the beginning of Napoleon&#39;s presidency of the farm, which Orwell symbolized Stalin as many critics analyzed .. The farm affairs develop, seven commandments are laid down as laws for them, some battles occur with other farms, all of this until we reach the paper end only, where it explains In short, the revolutionary who once revolted in the name of justice turned into a monster that does not differ from the human race by anything, as there is no difference between what is seen between a pig and a human being ... The end of what we are still under its weight ... It is true that it is by its events and personalities, where the interpretation is prolonged, symbolizing what was before During and after the Stalinist era, as Orwell raged, it was only suitable for any society to be described as a human being. A distinct from Hiwanath ... only feet-two method:. When you read this novel, you come back like a child who loves token stories. Symbolism is a key element of this novel, which, if it lacks some narrative elements, is but it revolves around a certain historical era that was shaped intelligently by Orwell, on a farm of animals. It goes beyond being a short story, with its mark and sarcasm, to a hybrid world, in which the donkey obeys and does not speak to any defeated person, the loyal horse who works hard without knowing what is happening, the protected dog that represents the police of power, and the pig itself i.e. the power made by the people She pounced on him in the name of freedom ... a favorite.

There is almost everything beside the hotel although it is a bit random shops. There is a new annoying phone located in the middle of each floor and next to the rooms and its sound is very loud ... wake me up from sleep more than once .... I would never recommend this hotel to anyone who may sleep in the afternoon or noon times because of this annoying phone. There is a pub for drinking alcohol next to Reception and elevators The elevator took a drunken man with me and one of the hotel employees was forced to go up with us in order to protect me from what I could have been exposed to with this drunken man.

And money through the five and what is thrown in the thresholds and scenes, who among them stands up to these temptations, especially if we know that most of them took this path except for the satisfaction of his desires in sex and money ??

"Beautiful, it ended in record time, like all of Noor&#39;s novels. But this time, as far as I am concerned, the novel ended with the death of dreams. Or do you think that what is meant is that dreams sometimes die but can be replaced by another method? Even if this was intended, then everything I read after her death did not concern me at all, and I did not mean to reduce the effort of the author at all, so there must have been an end to the novel, and I have succeeded completely in writing this end, which some may see a happy ending. Yes, it is a happy ending to Jabr and Mary, after all their suffering. Until I wrote that suddenly appeared on the scene, I took a share of that happiness, even if it was not complete. As for Yassin, the handsome and rich doctor who loved sincerely and sincerely, he made me cry with his message of dreams that I read in public in appreciation of her or in appreciation of what was between them. Sorry, I did not dream of dreams, I pity her a lot until the moment of her death when I told Gabr that it was from her scent .. She did not tell him my daughter or daughter or even Yassin&#39;s daughter. Just an orphaned girl who smells who I love. Algebra is one of the characters that we only see between the two heads of a book, so where is the man who marries someone whom she does not love, who tolerates her wailing and depression and raises her child who is from another man. Where is the man who loves in this way? . Also, we will not see it in our real world. We will not see this woman who would like her daughter to be called her husband&#39;s sweetheart. And smile. I was born from a mother and father that you did not see. Mama and Papa spoke to two other people who were not her real parents. So is there more cruelty than that?

"An exciting novel, as usual, Ala Al-Aswany .. I did not miss a moment and I read it. It is not a pure historical novel ... even though this was my belief when I heard about the historical period about which you are talking. Honestly ... I do not think it takes him five years, according to what is written behind .. Although the people you are talking about are theoretically impossible to answer any documented information they were living with what and not the details of their lives with the magnificence that Dr. / Alaa wrote. The narrative plot was weaker than the previous two novels, the architecture of Jacobian and Chicago ... I had imagined that all people would relate to more than that on the last novel, as he did with an unparalleled genius in Chicago. May I say that the dose of sex was in excess of the need ... but no ... sincere ... for me this is a normal thing ... without hypocrisy and frankly sex and especially stayed in Egypt actually constitutes events and represents a part and a terrible factor in The lives of the Egyptians. However, he stated in the novel that he provided the dose of enjoying the novel and its events and let the one read it, and he is amused especially that many of it are related to the cam of Qafsheya and a special story when I come to Aisha&#39;s biography ... However, Alaa Al-Aswany thought he was intentional and basically he was speaking On him again, we will also speak on it, as well as a line .. This was generally more polite and less shocking than the previous two novels ... especially, and we know that this period was a period in which this talk will happen .. this is not a period far away from us in Time, which gives it a separation from us in a way ... as if we are watching the things that happen, not part of the written reality. The genius of the novel in two needs:. The first thing is to choose the main topic and heroes. This novel talks about the invisible people ... as one of us when he was watching the images of Faruq and not the era in general, he focused on the image of the Aswan man and not the Nubian who stands to serve the people de ... we are all attributed and commented on the distinction of Faruq. .. The beauty of the princesses ... the confusion ... the personalities and relationships ... the sessions ... the decoration even and the inanimate objects were more important to us than we do not see them as countries ... even though the countries of our ancestors and our relatives ... the countries of the true Egyptians .. Countries of most of the Egyptian people ... countries of scavengers and delivery workers who are sitting on the coffees day and night and those who are confident in the lines of living and the good children who are in the college I did not marginalize the owners and put them on, it is not like that ....... The people who do not appear under the sun ... The people who live in the faces of the walls ... The people that you feel are not in society ... The Murlock who spoke to Wales in a wonderful machine Time. These people are the backbone of any society ... The people who do not struggle to fear and know them will meet another world ... all vital, sincerity, concerns and feelings .. a real world in which real people live, not fake by a little money, parties, shows, Arab and Brides have a game and a little zombie, they move and act like a place ... the world that Metsi knew of his interference and was amazed by it and decided that she sacrifices everything needed so that it remains one of him despite the external form that asphalt. He concluded, but the novel and a very hard copy of the image that was righteous ... which I think you did not focus on in the first place when I came to buy the novel .. Or it can be felt that it is a picture of a closed or not this way .... countries of the protagonists .. countries that strike each day In the end, if you mistake it or not, it is wrong, for justice, and I hope that they will not be like the mind of the people ... The countries that exist are not living. Those living are not living ... insects who respond from all of Egypt to suck their blood, and when they die, they are in a million others. ... the people who didn’t hope ... The six envisioned countries are Abdoun, Hassanein, Karara, Bahr, Abdel Aziz, Mahmoud, Samahi and others ... who we did not like We see them other than when Dr. Alaa and Rana people are really in this novel. The second point: This is a strange perspective about the novel, and I will read it to me. Man is by nature a primitive being ... instinctively ... originally like any animal ... Originally instincts are the primary motivation in animals ... and this is not an insult ... this is a fact ... instincts are a grain of hormones that are excreted in us as they do not excrete at any An animal ... lust, fear, hunger, and thirst ... It is true that the difference is that I have a mind of mind: whoever restrains the animal being led and our case is intended instincts and costly and free because this is the length of history in a cultural and moral class that is ours We will avoid this with our instincts, because we do not discuss animals ... a class that remains to be formed with our experiences ... with the collective mentality of human beings over time ... from religions and literature and He sees it ... it is the class that we work with people ... I can&#39;t tell a mask that in fact it is not a mask ... this is supposed to be left with us being a human being and a human being ... it is the layer that we say we are supposed to do what we do and what we do in situations .. is what determines our behavior based on our social position, etc. But no matter how thick the layer is, this is the atmosphere for each one of us ... except that our subconscious mind is not a penny, it is the origin in us, it is a grain of chemicals, our life, we will not be able to get rid of it, no matter how much we try, and no matter how sophisticated ... ... whether with all rudeness, like what they used to do with Mahmoud and Fawzi in the novel, and like what I did not work with the girls who slept with them ... whether by finding justifications such as what he did Karara and Hassan when they went to the ko, so that the beating will return again in exchange for it Tipping back. Whether in circumstances that pass by our superiority ... like what was full and Abdoun hours they spent with the Koo and Mister Wright in every call, although this was not what anyone imagined. I was asked by real feelings of contradicting custom, which people settled on, like the opinions of the Egyptians, and the love of Metsi for the whole .... and this was what I was talking about, that the sex in the novel was employed from this perspective ... I know you are just any good community .. You will find the richest and most aristocratic classes by interfering and interacting with the lowest class in society with the image of your age what you imagined .. and what more picture will shock you other than sex, Alaa can explain it in the story .... instincts are a main engine in people&#39;s behavior ... interactions and results The one who appears on her with the strangest aspiration of the results of changing the course of any nation .. Think of burning my dear to himself and not what, except for Hitler, remains Hitler .. Q I was talking about Er. In the end ... the Automobile Club is not better than the Yaqoubian Building and not Chicago ... My relationship with it is not so much because it happened in a relatively long period ... The political projection if it means means to the one with a tiger there is not clear to me ... People are not drawn like I did not get used to Alaa Al-Aswany ... but in general I enjoyed her very much. And oh right ... the first thing in the first place is that the characters of the novel are out of it ... and Karl Benz&#39;s time is not surprising. I can say that Karl Benz’s time appears to be an important part of the novel, which is that the six are always a key driver in any event .. whether by her will or whether by attracting the man to her, she has the same idea of instincts as Brdo, and that this changes the course of any need ... but if it is his intention actually ... the novel remains a major aspect of its focus on one subject ... the point where writings are written and a complete literary aspect is adopted on it and a flaw originally comes as a sub-topic in a novel. The first part is for science fiction. I forgot to talk about it originally from the many pieces of what is strange and separate from the novel .. I do not know he was trying out a new need or what

Accomodation in the magnificent, distinctive caves is first class: comfortable beds, well-equipped kitchen and shower room. Everything has great touches, and the cleanliness is a skilled maid who comes every day to change the covers and clean carefully. The best time is when sitting on the balcony amid beautifully cared for flowers, looking at the amazing volcanic landmark and watching the cliffs change to pink as the sun sets. In fact it is so special that you may leave the beach early to return to the charm of your balcony. There are hundreds of steps of stairs going down and then going up again, and breakfast is not served with such a good kitchen, who would need it? There is no swimming pool with the Aegean Sea that surrounds you, who needs it too. If any of these matters cause you, you will not be able to enjoy the magic of Ares Caves. But you will be the loser. Additional tip: You will be encouraged to take a trip to the local volcano. The boat trip around the volcanic landmark is wonderful, but the volcano itself is a disappointment. You have to take a steep path for half an hour in the heat, and then search for some brown stones.

These two views are from beautiful scenery alike. We were lucky enough to be moved to rooms overlooking the Nile that were a bonus ... although I never imagined that the rooms overlooking the pool would be so beautiful. Everything in the hotel was clean and comfortable, but I have to provide a negative comment about the staff of the guards in the main restaurant ...

Death is present, killing has become a feature of difference, intellectual differences no longer exist in their gorgeous form, but rather killing and death in the human arena ... I am satisfied with this amount and leave the rest to the deficient reader who is able to understand the symbols that Sinan spread here and there, the hidden words and hidden messages that he sent to future generations ... =. Were some people very superficial, or only I who felt this way? I could not touch them, despite the size of their aches.

"Of the novels that dazzle you, arouse your enthusiasm, and thinks that it is the best that you have read, but once you close it and with only one day passing by reading it you forget .. but few are the stories that make you stand in front of it amazed, stunned, make you think, change, change your perception of all things around you. You are raised to the top to see the foundations of the highest, purest and purest selves, to see the truth clearly and clearly. You see rampant mold in everything around you, shocked by the fact that the mold comes not only from those around you, but also from within you. Some of the novels are what you can express our feelings: joy, sadness, crying, fear, hope .. You feel it while reading it, so that you can touch it inside you, make yourself confused while you cry with heroes, laugh with them and grieve with them. But few are the stories that frighten you. It is not the horror you feel when reading novels by Stephen King or Adgar Alan Poe. Or what you feel while reading any novel that talks about ghosts and werewolves. Rather, it is your horror while reading a symbolic philosophical novel. The horror that causes you to fear the same fate is what befell the protagonists. After every page, you are afraid to lose your sight or drown in that milky river as the author described it. Sarmago terrified me. The length of my reading of the novel and my eyes are wide open, perhaps due to the ugliness of events, or perhaps it is an instinctive movement for fear of meeting the same fate. How did he manage this suffering and tragedy with this creativity? How to plot plot and events, make you see them in front of you, and live inside them. The novel demonstrated the human nature of man, making him lose only one of his senses, to reveal his instincts, animal nature, and selfishness. He is going wandering on his face, without organization, his first and last concern is to satisfy his instincts. And if he has some power, his second concern is power and control. Was it strange that this woman was the only one who did not lose sight? How can an epidemic approach an angel like her, an angel who feels his responsibility and duty is to help those others who cannot help themselves. You don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re being helped or helped, but rather it&#39;s the call of duty. It is the reason why her eyes remained healthy for him. Like a mother who holds the hand of her child to love without falling down, hold your hand to guide you, so that your eyes are no longer able to see. Like a mother who cleans her baby without disgusting or regretted, she cleanses you of all that is attached to you from the fouling of quarries. Like a mother who roars when the danger approaches her children, she is killed if it is the only option to defend her group ... Like a mother who still feels the responsibility towards her children even after they grow up, she still feels her responsibility towards her group, her protection and feeding ... how a pandemic like this to approach From the mass of tenderness, courage and giving like her? His description of city life by the black gangster terrified me. Such an epidemic may reveal the dirty side of the human being, and it may turn a city upside down. He might return it to the first primitive ... His description of their condition without water and food made me wonder, How did the first humans live? It seems easy to get used to the difficulty of life when you find it as it is, but after you and your body get used to progress and technology, it is difficult for you to deal with nature alone. You cannot wait for rain, do not eat flowers and tree leaves, nor search for water wells and cavities. It becomes impossible for you to deal with nature face to face without stages separating you. Tired but after I finished reading it, I feel that I have become more visionary than before; perhaps it is the insight that Sarmago makes you realize and takes your hand to make you touch it inside you, or maybe it is only an appreciation of these eyes, after what you saw from the scourge of blindness. I don’t know exactly, but all I realize is that it changed something internal .. creativity is embodied in words. Done

"A book that made me confused about my confusion, does a person spend his life day after day, or stands up to build a decent life, either a decent life or death, writes the planets as if he lives between us and witnesses our condition, I wonder how he drew that picture in the last century, I see him what he would do if he was living now and witnessing All of this tyranny, and how do young people lose their vigor and determination day after day as they face this sweeping flow of thieves who are free in broad daylight? See what he would do. He sees us submissive, deprived of pride and dignity like this .. In my view, I see the first and most important reason for complacency and despotism is education, education in its three main aspects moral education, religious education and scientific education, the fall of education led to individuals accepting submission to other than God, contentment with humiliation for life, This is because they do not understand freedom and appreciate its value, so how do you ask a bird that has been trapped in the cage since its inception to fly and fly in the sky until it opens the door to the cage in front of it, that he does not know how to fly and does not realize his pleasure and the beauty of flying away from the cage and so man, he lost some basic values that raised him to submit And the millet He was satisfied with it until he became palatable .. As for the solutions that he presented, some agreed, and some did not. The most severe thing I agree with is the presence of an alternative solution, otherwise we fall into another tyranny in a new form and a different color, but in the end it is also darkness, but I disagree with him that the solution must be from time Soft and this is what differed in it. When he found the alternative solution, he must confront tyranny with full force, determination and decisiveness. The people of the oppressors must be cut off ... In general, a wonderful book that helps you reflect on the negligence in which we live as a nation, as groups and as individuals.

All their feelings came from the love of his wife, the hatred of his brother, and the respect of Dr. Jalal to him and his greatness, Najib. Sorour, who is the most wise of our time. Because my acquaintance with Nagib Sorour before the novel was not more than an illiterate poem, so the novel was an important reason, so my idea of his personality was completely changed. We answer Sorour. Al-Ula Al-Maarri The novel was an introduction to the life of Naguib Surour. The views of Naguib Sorour impressed me on those who considered the great people of this era, from Salah Juheen, Naguib Mahfouz and Abdel Wahab, and even Umm Kulthum and Abdel Halim, and I was more impressed by the strength of the dialogue that took place between Naguib Surur and Naguib Mahfouz in the Abbasid Hospital and detailing his famous recording session of the illiterate poem.

"A very beautiful novel that deserves good reputation and fame and, of course, the Poker Prize ... very fun in a smooth manner ... It draws you from the beginning. The translation makes you think of it as a Filipino novel translated into Arabic, surprising that the writer is Kuwaiti, not realizing the truth except in the last lines of the novel in a very short translation made it a narration closer Reality from fiction, and there are actually many similar stories, so if Jesus and Josephine were a novel that we read, then we can be sure that the reality includes many people who resemble them with differing details ... to A we are the reason we obtained it but inherited it, it plundered a lot of pleasure and joy from us, it seems that we differ a lot from inside us, we are dispersed .. This is how when we sanctify habits that God did not descend from Sultan .. they do not differ a lot from us they had great aspirations such as Josephine that was She aspires to finish her studies and get a good job, many of them are chaste women whose difficult circumstances limited them to work in homes and they did not want vice, such as Josephine when she said my master left my country to escape such things, and she also asked him to confirm after the marriage was this only we become a couple? She was not sure yet that Rashid had rightly become her husband. They are humans just like us. According to the reference, except that we enter religion and bring it into our affairs as we like, and by this we do harm to ourselves first and foremost. As for religion, it is preserved by the Almighty and sanctified .. As is always the case, not everything that a person develops realizes, and the reality is not like imagination. There is no return of Jesus to the Philippines and his surrender, even though he has the right to enjoy living in Kuwait, being materially better than the Philippines like any Kuwaiti, but this thing won the novel a lot of realism ... In short, I say the novel is very beautiful, really worth reading ... Thank you Saud Al Sanousi ..

"Ibrahim Essa if you followed him neutrally and not baffled him or against him. It is people who can attract you to him and to his writing. A tightly written novel, sketch and description with interest for the characters. But the empty filling and narration was more than the core of the events. In his novel, he retaliated against the ruling regime, but in a way that would not cross the mind of the length of the novel. Through the brother-in-law of the president&#39;s son, it is a really great loophole. I liked some of Mawlana Hatim Al-Shinnawi&#39;s propaganda terms and as elders they say they are peelings of religion, that is, its surface. They do not say its depth because they do not find anyone who understands it or funds it for the media, but the scales are funded. Of course, I will not judge my disagreement or my agreement with him on any religious matters, because they are based on fake characters. The bottom line is that the novel defects it in its literary judgments, narration style, and dialogue are colloquial Ali Foshi. I think from my point of view, it is cut off from writing, then returning to the sequel, but it is a good novel.

Of course everyone who reads this book realizes the frightening and confusing similarity with the state of Egypt these days and of course The splendor of this book lies in the ability to predict and extrapolate what the situation will be based on according to the actions of governments and the morals of the people .. What I liked most about Utopia is that it is not only a social account of what the writer expects to happen within ten years, but the attempt to extrapolate within the reasons The results and motives behind this farce are an attempt to read For the same humanity and the reader’s involvement of the characters themselves while trying to reach the motives and reasons behind their actions and beliefs, utopia discusses human greed in the lowest form, the ability to transform mental and logical abilities to keep pace with the surrounding environment, trying to understand or extrapolate where things go to us .. Jabir has some hatred He has intelligence, cowardice, courage, nobility in the middle of this quagmire, and of course, his sister, Safia, defends with all his might the power of her will and the freedom of her choices, as Rasim says ... Germinal, the innocent insignificant girl, and how he is still clean inside despite all her sins .. and the most important character She is the utopian boy who doesn&#39;t The writer committed himself to his name, and if he had known himself to the jealousy with Alaa, the mysterious figure who would almost understand him at the beginning of the novel and then be disgusted by his actions and that internal darkness that governs his actions, the insignificance of himself, which is revealed in his words when he attacked Safiye .. Side characters such as Al-Sarjani and Azza and Sumaya and Abd al-Zahir also devise for her psychological dimensions that are intertwined throughout the events .. The novel discusses consumer religion, morals and many other social and psychological dimensions..I only fault with the novel that you feel while reading it that you are watching an American movie translated, even if this brings the language closer and Juvenile breeding events to watch these movies may be Justified in the events of the novel to overlap the Egyptians with the Marines and the Israelis, but he sometimes dominated the narrative in my opinion, which reduces the affiliation of Arabic literature and an example of this I really hate his guts, as the Americans say.

Then his transfer and friction with a group that made him an extremist fundamentalist, through which he almost became a terrorist.

"I was in the process of collecting my thoughts and final observations about the novel, when I got to the last pages, and if Dostoevsky surprised me with these lines in which he responded to the words that began gathering themselves to confront him, he wrote: I admit that I do not wish to be a novelist depicting a hero who is a member of a family coincidentally an effort without fruit and beauty. These models are still from the current life in any case, so they cannot be complete with aesthetic. How can the writer avoid errors, exaggerations and omissions here? It will be for the writer or reader to guess and go overboard with guessing what remains for a writer who does not want to be limited to historical narratives .. Rather, it dominates the desire to write about what is current reality? To guess and .. to make mistakes. . Similar names are a basic problem in the novel, where I had to stop and check for sure about any character who was speaking, my first reading of Dostoyevsky, an intimate novelist, speaking from within the characters of his novel, from the heart of her fears and dreams, we approach through him to man, and the teenage novel is only a long reflection on This strange creature .. Quotes :. Neither do you know what to do, nor do I know what to do, when the Russian, when he went out of the way for which the habit was drawn, did not know what to do.

It is an interesting and interesting thing to see what the views of the high society people feel about each other, and on what basis they respect each other. . Why is life so short this whole palace? Most probably, the goal of shortening it is not to be boring, because life is also an artwork of the works of the Greatest Creator, drafted in complete final form as a poem by Pushkin. Brevity is the first condition of art. But those who are not bored should be allowed to live longer. . Simplicity, dear, simplicity is the most cunning. . He has a wide mind, but his heart is worried. . But this love that the strong holds for the weak is sometimes much more violent and painful than the love between two equal, because the strong bear the responsibility of his weak friend despite his will. . A person cannot live without prostration. Without prostration, man cannot bear himself. . How could all the feelings of peace and the joys of the armistice all combine with the beating of my dying, unruly, painful, delicious pain, and with the appalling stormy decisions that I intend to make? I do not know. . Laughter. Atheism. Suicide. Suicide is the biggest sin of a person. But the Lord is the only ruler, because He alone knows everything, standards and limits. It is our duty to pray to God for the examples of these great sinners. If you have heard of such a sin as this sin, pray to its confused supplication before you sleep, and intercede with the Lord even if you do not know him, and if you do not know him, your intercession will be more beneficial as well. . But are they many of those who stand and persist in caring for others ’happiness? If the money is not a god, then it is half a deity. . A lock in theories and utter ignorance of life. . Sadness mixes with joy whenever years pass, then it becomes impossible for a happy exhale. This is how things happen in this world: every soul is tested and comforted. . A human being is a device that informs of the complexity that a person cannot understand anything, especially if this person is a woman. . But it seems to me that when a person has a large part of culture, he cannot express his victorious victorious happiness. . Russian women come down to them quickly, and their beauty expires. . As if this human being had surprised her by a fixed idea, so she was very tormented because she is beyond her powers. . Their weapon was always logic. Where logic is, boredom. . So, humans realize that they are completely alone, and suddenly they feel abandoned orphaned. . To tighten what they will hasten to love, in order to suffocate the great sadness in their hearts. . My friend, I suddenly felt that serving the idea never absolved me, as an ethical and sane person, from the happiness of at least one human being during my life, practical happiness. . The educated, superior person who seeks a supreme idea turns his back on daily life sometimes, so he becomes ridiculous and funny, becomes freaky, becomes cool, and I even say frankly that he becomes stupid, in practical life of course. . All that he possessed of freedom had disappeared at once when that meeting was, and the man found himself forever drawn to a woman who had nothing in common between her. . Your whole culture and culture has cost you torture and fights that you have fought throughout your life, but it has received perfection for free. This is not equal in anything. This is what arouses frustration in women. . You have a tough soul, the same woman. Mama was demolished a demolition. . One can speak with words what he wants, and indicate with words anything. As for deciding, legislating, and implementing .. this needs special printing and strong grievance. I marry him because I will be quieter with him than I am with another. Then keep myself whole for me. . There is no doubt that I abuse you. This is a severe fancy flaw. One thing I know is that if I was with you I had finished, and if I was absent from you I would have finished too. As long as I am with you and without you, you are always with me wherever you are. I know that I can hate you more than I can love you ...

"This is a great hotel, but there are still some remarks this year that we went back to the Hotel des Cascades. It is still a great hotel but we had some minor problems. The comprehensive menu was ok but there was a limited amount of drinks to choose from and only local drinks were included. We would be grateful if more wine selections are available. We had hoped for some development as we were returning visitors we had visited this place before. We got a room with a beautiful view of the Red Sea. The golf courses were in good condition, however the vet was not deep enough and needed some attention. One day, unfortunately, the stadium was crowded with too many players, so we had to wait over a minute after our time to start. The break took more than hours and this is a very long time. In the middle of the week a large group of local residents came to the hotel. This has greatly affected the general atmosphere. The hotel was not prepared to entertain children and most guests came to play golf and enjoy a quiet day at the pool. But with this large group it was not possible to calm the afternoon at the pool. Finally, I would like to ask the administration to prevent smoking in the Eagle&#39;s Bar, smoking in this bar created a bad public atmosphere and made our clothes smell of smoke.

"If you want to know the state of the Palestinian woman, you must use this narration. You will surely live in her airspace moment by moment. She will laugh sometimes and cry sometimes, so that she knows that life on this earth is a gift and an ordeal .... The novel spoke about Magida&#39;s suffering upon her marriage to Ismael Ibn Ibn Jenin camp, The intensity of the pain that she felt was from the Palestinians of Jordan, where the bridge, search, torture, humiliation and all forms of torment are found there .. The events of the novel move us from the marriage of Magda and Ismail to the burning of the Al-Aqsa Intifada after the criminal Ariel Sharon defiled it and the response of the Palestinian street With calls for resistance and response to the crimes of the occupier, he went out For an entire people, including men and women, old and young, with marches that roamed the entire Palestinian cities, and it was necessary to sacrifice the soul and the money and all that we have, so the martyr rose and many were injured and the houses were destroyed on their residents and the money and properties were confiscated and the people were not left Except God. During the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Magda was in the last months of her pregnancy, and, God willing, she would lose her fetus, Nour, as a result of exposure to a young woman in a university march, and of course she was hiding the news of her pregnancy from her husband, as she was not meeting very often, because of the nature of his work as a nurse and resistance at the same time .. she rolled Days and every day, the siege and restrictions on camp residents are increased in order to search for resistance fighters by the authority of Oslo and the Zionist occupation, until the massacre of the Jenin camp took place and many camp residents were martyred, homes were destroyed, and everyone threatened to kill, what was from the people The camp except to flee to their relatives outside the camp, and there Magda met Ishmael and Lall He has to be a mother of two children who are hope and light .. The longing in the hearts of the fans increases whenever their rows inflame the torments of separation, so was Magda’s condition, so her husband now can no longer visit and see his children, he is one of the wanted people for the authority and the occupation army, and if he must From a conversation between the spouses, the messages placed at the grave of their child Nour are the solution, as Ismail sealed it with the number of Zionists who were killed .... Undoubtedly, the husband’s absence left the great void in his family, so Magda decided to join one of the media agencies in order to spread the suffering Prisoners and the people, as soon as Magda became famous and her writings began, the authorities and the occupation began to pledge He was killed or arrested, and she was actually arrested for six months and then deported to Amman. There, she did not remain idle but continued her media work and opened an institution that manages the affairs of Palestinian women .... One morning, the tragic news to her was that her husband was besieged and He was arrested by the occupation forces, to become a hostage to them, the days passed and no one met with another, and despair crept for everyone that there is no freedom after today, but God is against the resistance by kidnapping an Israeli soldier to become a bargain with the occupation, where the condition of the resistance was to launch He was released in exchange for a prisoner from various organizations, and Ismail was scheduled to be released, as C. When he deported him to Gaza, his family prepared to travel to Gaza to receive her resisting son after a severe absence and a longing, to set foot in the land of Gaza and bless the hands of those who were credited with his release, to embrace the husband and children, the breath of air, sunlight, and everything in Gaza .. This is how the novel ended with seeing light and hope in the face of God Almighty, and this is what every prisoner in his prison demands, and I ask God Almighty to hasten relief for our leader Abdullah Al-Barghouthi, the owner of this narration, as he is in dire need of light and hope in his life, to complete what remains of Life .

"Before going into the details of the novel, I would like to point out that the events mentioned in this novel are not suitable for small age groups, people with weak seals, and those with sensitive equipment ... The novel was named after the Impaler, according to Vlad Dracula, and to the state of Laashia, one of the European provinces that was affected by the Ottoman tide ... Dracula, the bitterness of shame and disgrace, and subjected to the Ottoman tutelage against his will, which made him decide to rebel against Muhammad al-Fatih, the Ottoman governor and take revenge on the Boyars ’group of traders of Saxon origin who ruled in the state of Laashia and revolutionized Father Dracul at the instigation of the King of Hungary and spared no effort in punishing his people and anyone Its relationship in any way with the Puyars or the Turks who were present at the time in Bucharest and Turkiche, the capital of the impaler .. What is noticeable is that the name impaled was not in vain for the son Dracula, but applied with his letters to him .. It was that the foolish monster was penetrating a column whose end was flat on the back of the person, a man who was Or a woman until he settles inside by the amount of two fists and then raises it on a wooden pillar and remains suspended like this until death; that depends on the path the column goes through. Either he reaches his heart or until he comes out from between his eyes .. It was said that those boys were eating his food between the trunks of suspended trees. Individuals had a delight in watching together He accused and their slow death .. The brutality of that crazed did not stop there but rather it was said that he was filling pots of up to five people with water or oil and leaving holes in the mouth to the heads and burning the fire underneath and coming with his old drink and he was afraid to watch the screams of people while they were ripening on the fire .. It was also said that he built A castle for him called Bunary, a distance of a thousand and five hundred degrees from the earth, a ladder dug by the Boyars, who gave them the chance to live by running through the piles .. He tormented a group of Roma whose homelands have children and were ripped and matured of the best of them and ordered the rest to eat their brothers and subject them to him and his rule ... It is said that Vlad Dracula He was killed in his prison in Hungary upon the recommendation of Muhammad Alfa The governor of Al-Othmani after he escaped from Laashia and was betrayed by his brother Radu and followed the Ottoman rule ..... The novel speaks in its entirety about the myth of the return of the spirit of Dracula. Killed in his bathroom and broken from his neck as if he was a bite of a bite .. He also avenges his killers and the Ottomans .. When the myth of the return of the impaler and spread of fear spread throughout the Ottoman Empire, Muhammad al-Fateh decided to send an envoy called Orhan Effendi to refute that myth and spread the tyranny in the hearts of people .. begins The novel is the journey of Orhan Effendi to Bukhar Six and paradoxes and events continue to become clear in the end that the one who commits crimes in the name of the spirit of Vlad Dracula and has Micah and Michael who decided to avenge their father ... Lessons learned from this novel:. If someone wrongs in the right of someone, apologize to him immediately and before it is too late, because he may leave and you will not be able to apologize to him at all. Do not trust a beautiful woman who seduces you and lures you to your death. You have to suspect the least likely person to commit a heinous crime ... as a poor servant, for example. Trust completely in what reason and logic say, and follow their rules with hidden intelligence, because perhaps logic of despotism becomes one of the most important reasons for reason and general safety. Exposed intelligence inevitably leads to serious consequences. Do not cast your mistakes on the devil, who has no energy except by whispering to you .. For your mistakes are borne by the evil emirate first. Finally, it struck me strongly that all the horrific crimes committed in history against humanity adhered to religious beliefs .. I do not think that religion is absolutely related to inhumanity .. I do not know whether it makes sense for me to send a message to those who use religion as a cover for his brutality that he not only offends himself but also religion ... but I I send a message to people not to believe that any religion is linked to bloodshed ... because the sky is shaking with blood.

"If you have not read the novel yet, then do not see the rural areas until after you read the novel yourself. The novel is divided into three lives, the first is the month of wedding, the second is the shock of the desert, and the third is the mother of the boys. The protagonist is slowed down, and the first life says of him: As he takes the cup from the trembling hands, he says in a low voice: Thank you, Aunt. I wished for a moment with a dreamy heart, if it was he who came to address me .. but he was not, he was my brother, my younger sermon than him, who called them the writer; because he writes to them the contracts of trade, and he is called there Nabati even though they are all Nabat, and he who will teach me in a later life, hidden The words of the Arabs and the secrets of touching the meanings with words .. It is from a line called the cover of the novel is the hero, but when we see it only a little. With one double-sided God, and with eternal truth, I say the truth. There is only a son and a mother in the universe, where every mother and son are in them. The son Ishtiaq and the mother bosom. And they have birthing and birth. El-Lat, the essence of all beings and the origin of the hourly images. Inactive in the womb is safe, and all dormant. Do not listen to those who underestimate and rise up, then Han, true to mankind. It is time for my two-sided appearance to come. The Nabati Prophet. With these words the words of the hero started. The events of this novel take place in the seventh century AD, where wars were grinding between the Persians and the Romans, and between the emergence of prophets, including the Prophet Qureshi Muhammad the Messenger of God, and how the Arabs became a military and pivotal power. Egypt, and talks about the Christianity, and there was a slight rescue of Christianity, and after that Maria marries an Arab husband from the Nabataeans ... who are the Nabataeans? They are Arabs who lived in Egypt, Iraq and the Levant by Islam and Christianity. Where did this name come from? The name is more likely to be derived from the distinctive characteristic of this huge ancient group. It is an attribute that distinguished them from the rest of the Arabs, as they were able to extract water from the arid desert. This is the popular opinion, but the fact is that the Nabataeans were skilled in engineering the collection of water that rarely descends with torrents. This narration tells an important time period in the history of Egypt ,,. Including: the ten years of the Persians ’occupation of Egypt and the strong Arab presence in the Levant and Iraq before the emergence of Islam, and like the long Turkines that preceded the coming of Amr bin Al-Aas to take over the affairs of Egypt and many related myths. But the novel presented all of this according to the context of the events, and according to Maria, whose name became Maoist, after she got married to this Nabati merchant .. The first life ends with a marital marriage and the second life begins, which is a journey through the Sinai desert, this life was not very important, but the last life or The boys describe the customs of the Arabs in marriage, describe some events, and describe the era of the many prophets in them, especially the Nabati. The only comment that we hear from the Nabati about Islam was when they brought him a copy of the Qur’an, so he looked at it long, and he looked at the distant plains, and then he said, as if talking Himself: brings this, blood coming? Many of the Nabataeans entered Islam, and the Jews and the Nabataeans were expelled except Egypt, to pave the way for the conquest of Egypt ... Nabati remained alone in his homes ... and the end of the tongue was the Coptic Maoism. Do they overlook them, and they are already heedless. So I return to him to stay with him. And together we die. Then we are born again ... these two?

"This religion and the future of this religion are two valuable books for the martyr Sayyid Qutb, during which he presents focal points dealing with important pillars on which the great Islamic religion is based. Many people have forgotten about it, forgotten by others and ignored others. The most prominent of them in this book is the concept of Islam as a method for human beings and in it the writer shows the nature of Islam’s work in life and how it is on Although it is a divine approach that depends in its mechanism and results on human efforts, it is a dynamic religion that pushes towards work, movement and construction. It urges its followers to take reasons that motivate them to plow and sow on watering and caring for hard work and effort in order to reap the fruits .. It is the religion of instinct, the religion of logic is God’s law. Here, Mr. says: Some people expect from this religion as long as it is a home from God to work in the lives of people in a magical supernatural mysterious reasons and without any consideration for the nature of humans and their innate energies and their material reality at any stage of their development and in any environment of their environment. . He adds: This divine approach, which Islam represents in its final form, as stated by Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, is not achieved in the earth and in the world of people. Once it comes down from God, it is not achieved by a word. Be divine directly the moment you download it. And it is not achieved by simply communicating it to people and clarifying it, nor by divine oppression in the manner that its law passes through the course of astronomy and the functioning of the planets .. Rather it is achieved by carrying a group of people who fully believe in it and uphold it according to its energy and strive to achieve it in the hearts of others and in their lives as well and strive to this end with all that Owns. . It also shows the effect of that human effort on life and the soul, and he says: It is evident that leaving the divine approach to human endeavor to achieve it within the limits of human energy is good for human souls and good for human life .. We say this not to explain the will of God Almighty in making an order about what He has made but let us record only a realistic observation of the effects of this will in the lives of worshipers. . Then the writer turns to other aspects of the topic to present concepts and other characteristics of that approach, such as uniqueness, facilitation and influence, indicating each of them separately. Then he concludes with several Islamic principles and concepts that, in his opinion, caused a radical change in the concepts of nations and peoples, and it was a revolution in the full sense of the word that went beyond the borders of Muslim societies to spread all mankind and color the civilizations with their unique ideas. Which:. One humanity: liberation for the first time from the concept of national nationalism, ethnic, tribal, color, sexual, etc., and the trend towards human unity .. Almighty says: O people, we created you from a male and a female and made you people and tribes to know that if I honor you with God, I fear you, God is knowing an expert. . Great truth of God. . Generous humanity: Islam made human dignity derived from its own humanity, not from any other offer such as gender, color, class, wealth ..... etc .. The Almighty said :. We have honored the children of Adam, carried them on land and sea, provided them with good things, and preferred them over many of those who created us a preference. And when we said to the angels, bow down to Adam, and worship only Satan, my father, and he was proud, and he was one of the disbelievers. .... Great truth of God. . One Nation: Making Islam from a faith is a supporter of gathering, because belief is the most generous characteristic of the human spirit. The Almighty said: This is your nation, one nation, and I am your Lord, so worship. . Edema and creation: Islam established the foundations of morality in society and established systems and legislated for it and made it a basis in all dealings and made it a philosophy and etiquette even in times of wars and battles .. The Almighty says: And fulfill the covenant of God if you pledge and do not deny faith after its affirmation and you have made God a guarantor for you if God knows what you are doing, and you will not be like the one whose void has been revoked after the power of Ankatha. You take your faith as an income between you. To be a nation that is more of a nation than God. . Here are some beautiful quotes from wonderful passages mentioned in the book: Human instinct in its origin is consistent with the law of the universe .. When a person departs with his life system from that law, he not only collides with the vast universe, but also collides with his instinct that is between his sides, and he suffers, is torn, confused, anxious, and lives as humanity lives today in the torment of unhappiness despite all the scientific victories. And all material cultural facilities. . It is not true, starting with the fact that this divine approach costs the human psyche a more difficult effort than to tolerate it or to become long on it .. It is a truly noble approach, but at the same time it is an innate approach that depends on the balance of instinct and spends this balance. And its advantage is that he knows his way from the first moment to this balance. He knows his way to the human soul from the first touch. He knows her paths and curves, and he gently tramples her; he knows her entrances and exits, and he walks up to her in an upright manner and knows her powers and abilities, so he never exceeds her; she knows her needs and longings and meets her completely; and she knows her original builder energies, then he releases it to work and build. When Islam first confronted mankind, it faced this reality with the balance of instinct alone. The balance of instinct was with this debt; despite the long generations that passed and accumulated over the ruins of the broad pre-Islamic reality .. But the instinct of instinct was stronger than all of that aggregate; and the response of instinct was sufficient to shake that aggregate. . God has imposed jihad on believers not to hate people to convert to Islam but to establish on the earth his just, upright and just order that people choose their faith that they love under this system that includes both Muslim and non-Muslims in complete justice. The Almighty says: There is no compulsion in religion, adulthood has emerged from the abolition, so whoever disbelieves the tyrant and believes in God, you have adhered to the trustworthy loop, which is inseparable, and God is All-Knowing ...

"This book examines the underdevelopment resulting from the emergence of the phenomenon of the newly independent countries, which is called the third world .. It is known that there are many previous studies and studies on underdevelopment, but these studies have taken economic, industrial and sometimes social perspectives without examining the study of the underdeveloped human condition .. This book is so A type of entrance to the psychology of underdevelopment, which is an attempt based on observation and psychological and social analysis of the phenomena experienced by the oppressed person, an attempt that is not intended to reach final results but rather to contribute to the results that complement the social and economic studies of this phenomenon .. The human being of these societies was not seen as an essential element in any study whatsoever, so the author intended to put things in their proper framework by studying this category and analyzing its properties and knowing its structure and dynamism .. This book is a study of the psychology of the underdeveloped person, as the psychology of underdevelopment in human terms is the same psychological The oppressed human being is under the rule of oppression imposed on him who holds the reins of power .. The writer also worked on overcoming the superficiality that overshadowed the studies of development scholars on the reality of underdevelopment and tried to prove that the underdeveloped person stands as an obstacle in the face of changing the backward social structure due to the suspicion Tahama with his psychological structure .. The writer started the first section of the book with the psychological features of the underdeveloped presence by identifying and defining the retardation and put forward the theories of retardation represented by the superficial method in the study of retardation and a social and other economic method that attributes the cause of retardation to industrial and technical retardation and structural economic retardation and then presents the psychological perspective of retardation and its psychological characteristics and the most important These characteristics are oppression where a person goes through three stages: The stage of oppression and submission resulting from the complexes of deficiency, shame and disorder of permanence. The stage of persecution. The stage of rebellion and confrontation. After studying these characteristics, it is necessary to study the retarded mentality and its systematic mental characteristics, which suffer from the disorder of methodology of thinking and the limitations of dialectical reasoning. The writer attributed the mental retardation to two factors: education policy, mental retardation, relations of domination, subjugation, and mental retardation ... The author ends this section by studying the unconscious life of the oppressed person Its unconscious dynamics, that is, the hidden and driving factors of underdevelopment: The relationship of authoritarianism and subjugation of cataract and resulting in anxiety of the castration. Nature impinges on the image of the bad mother and leads to anxiety of abandonment. And underneath these coats of human being subjugated, defensive methods must be used in an unsuccessful attempt to get rid of the position of injustice. This is what the author presented in the second section, where he spoke about the four most important defensive methods, namely: Self-sufficiency. Either by sticking to the past and returning to the glorious past. Or thawing in the group and returning to the clan family, as he finds refuge in him from some of his responsibilities. Or even relying on others. Identification by the ruler. Identification by authoritarian identification with identification of his flesh, aggression, values and lifestyle. Superstitious control of destiny. There are two types of this control. Either control the present, for example the awliya, their shrines and their dignity, the jinn, the orcs and the devil, the hostile relationships, the envy and the magic. Where the oppressed person attributes what he is exposed to in his life for one of these reasons. Or the second type of control, which is controlling the future, such as flying, dream interpretation, fortune-telling and divination. Where his fate is related to one of these aspects. Or to attribute his status and backwardness, and anything that was destined to be delivered to him. Violence. Some manifestations of violence: Masked violence. The aggression, whether self-defeating or outward-oriented. Symbolic violence. Like delinquent behavior. Existential tension and persecutory relations. Among the psychological theories that explained aggression and violence: A view of animal psychology. A psychoanalytic view. Phenomenological point of view. Finally, it is necessary to talk about the position of women in the underdeveloped society, which has the largest share of oppression and marginalization. The writer has drawn features of the oppression that women live in the industrious and under-industrious milieu, in the middle class and in the privileged group. One of the oppressions experienced by women is deficiency and reduction. And the looting is either economic, sexual or ideological and is the most dangerous. Among the defensive methods women use against oppression are narcissistic inflation and indirect control over men.

"If you were an Arab leader, you would not have agreed to any agreement with Israel, then this is normal. We took their country, yes, God promised us this land, but this matter does not concern them .. Because our God is not their God, and this happened two thousand years ago, so what calls them to give him attention? They see only one thing that we came and stole their country, so why should they accept this? David Ben-Gurion. I was hoping that I would find a happy ending, but a realistic end to the extreme. I liked the gift, the dove, the pilgrim Mahmoud and Khaled al-Haj Mahmoud .. Yasmin and Sumaya. Al-Anisa, Al-Azizia, Khadra and Fatima Salem and Naji. Like you liked Palestine ..

This is how we are. The eastern society, an incomplete man, plays with this and that, and in return he does not accept anything but a pure woman who was not touched by anyone, so what do you realize that perhaps this lover is better than your wife?

"The book&#39;s author, Abd al-Rahman Munif, was born in Amman to a family from Najd, central Saudi Arabia, and studied in Amman, Baghdad and Cairo. He worked in the field of oil in Syria for a year where he then moved to work in the press in Beirut at Balagh magazine and moved in late to France full-time constituting a full writing of the novel so the salt cities with their first parts were among the most important of his products, which is a novel that has been translated into several languages, including English, German and Norwegian .. The novel Cruel, agonizing and terrifying embodying the bitter reality that one encounters in the Arab world with just a political opinion that may be aimed at changing or objecting to an unemployed regime, but in light of restricting the freedoms incarcerated, the fate was .. The work is mentioned by several parties equally between the main character Rajab, the prisoner of opinion and Anissa Naughty This major novel dealt with the issue of prisoners of conscience and what happens inside the corridors of prisons, as the torturers like to call torture ... Rajab is a persistent revolutionary figure. Therefore, he did not advocate absolute freedom, if freedom was his only goal, he would not risk his life .. when he carried all these types of torture. Silently .. long silence, for nothing but to overcome the executioners. Long for one cause, which is to raise a voice Stalking and nullifying falsehood and limiting the lives that are constantly lost in the corridors of dark prisons, where the false force is exercised, taking advantage of power and influence. Rajab asked: Is it possible to repair the will of a person whom I no longer associate with life in connection .. I am that person, no, I am not a human being, the prison in his early days tried to kill my body. I did not imagine that I endured everything they did but I endured it was only my will that receives the blows and turns back angry looks and silence. I was misled as well. I was not intimidated, I did not retreat: cold water, let it be, hang for seven days, let the threat of death and bullets around me spill over, so it was my will that resisted. The novel is coherent and interesting, the narration of events brought an interesting image with which it is difficult to stop except when it is completed as well as the plot is elaborate and the language is beautiful high-chain, I liked partially Rajab&#39;s monologue to the ship and the deep dialogues and the strength of the determination that the protagonist showed despite all the difficulties he experienced from torture including Beating and verbal abuse and all kinds of insult and injustice.

"No wonder that this full-fledged masterpiece wins poker, the writer excelled in it on all levels. Smoothness of the story line .. The connection between personalities and events .. And many many human values are buried here and there among the folds of the book. He accompanies you on a journey floating around with different feelings .. between anger and contentment .. between laughter and crying .. and sometimes even bereavement. Confused about speeding up to keep pace with events or slowing down so long to enjoy. It touches on many contradictions .. our hateful racism .. our unjust class ... our pure materialism ... our social hypocrisy ... our false condemnation ... and our complying with the unfair restrictions of society that God has brought down from authority. However, he was not satisfied with criticism only, but also praised some of the prevailing positive values, such as coexistence among a group of crazies ... friendship ... and the spread of peace between people, for example. In more than one personality, the writer raises the idea that evil is not rooted in the human soul, but it is an urgent matter .. It is the result of harsh conditions and suffering .. hardening the heart and obscuring his mercy, perhaps an invitation not to rush to judge others .. despite the fact that the novel is a special case for a Filipino / Kuwaiti Tah Between two countries .. except that all expatriate workers can be compared to them .. the next time you see a foreign worker .. remember that he has a humble house in the land of Mendoza of his own .. and has a family .. Josephine, Adrian, Alberto, Mama Aida and Merla ..Takes a bitterness for the stranger to support them. In the end, she leaves a manic world with questions: What is the homeland? What makes you belong to him? What is affiliation? Is an official document sufficient to be a citizen? Is happiness really what we wish for? Sure, everything happens because of, and for a reason.

The novel will take you to the year AD, when he carried the feeling of responsibility and a sense of nationalism, the protagonist of the real novel, Samir Al-Kuntar, who was not yet seventeen years old, to join one of the Palestinian liberation movements on the territory of his country, Lebanon, those movements that believed that extracting land from the occupier would not be through negotiations and organizations Rights, but through a gun, and through a very daring process, during which Samir and his group infiltrated the occupied land of Palestine, Israel, with the aim of capturing a number of Zionists to pressure the Zionist regime to achieve a set of achievements, including the liberation of Arab prisoners in the occupation prisons, changed the course of his life, where he was injured and arrested A colleague cited the rest of the group .. you&#39;ll find yourself immersed in the details of the life of a man he spent behind bars for a period of thirty years to connect to the year of liberation, where Samir rule despite a fabulous amount of the year. These words will tell you about the painful meaning of captivity, and they will describe the sweetness of dignity to you, even if you are in the grip of the enemy, who works hard to break your will, your dignity, your resolve and your identity. The novel will take you away from your reality, to find yourself alive in the solitary cells, and sometimes in the courtyard of the prison, you will find yourself in the depth of Palestinian liberation groups and among the Arab detainees living their pain and the meekness of some of them, even as if you hate yourself at the time, you will hear the voice of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, may God have mercy on him, emanating from among its words And you will get acquainted with many of the names that I have always heard mentioning via news broadcasts such as Marwan Al-Barghouti and my soul is coveted and many many of them .. Although the novel will plunge you into the details of life inside the prison and will give you a glimpse of the attempts to break the bone and rehabilitate between the thick jail and the detainee of pride, but you will not Radiate Never bored ... feeling that Seetmlkk is feeling distressed ... how excited turns the heroes do not take them in their struggle to blame gun holders and naval battles Khaida to wrench holders and Khaida empty intestine battles.

A very cruel formula ... lived by Samir Al-Quntar and whoever preceded him and those who followed him in the prisons of the occupation ... a cruel equation lived by detainees of conscience, dignity and freedom in the camps of injustice, brutality and injustice everywhere .. even here near us. But what will most disturb you in this novel ... is the symphony of patience and hope played by Kuntar and his colleagues in prison for all these years, who are satisfied, contemplated and contemplated ... that hope, which was carried by Israeli prisons to complete his university studies, even though his rule is five life sentences.

It is controlled by the most insidious men and priests. So he came strangely in shape and turned, and with the heart of a strange child on a strange land carrying in his heart the knowledge of a prophet and faith of Abd Saleh, calling on his people to worship one God and reject the idols that are of no use or harm.

"Do you know what the homeland is Safia? The homeland is that not all of this happen. This most famous quote is the first thing that comes to my mind if a book referring to Haifa mentioned this before I read it, of course. I do not know how a book that does not exceed fifty pages can summarize a human experience of that depth in a few lines. Ghassan Kanafani in Haifa walks you as if you see it in front of you with all its Arab details. The Palestinian cause turns into more than just memories or a stolen past, but it is a future issue, and in the end it becomes bigger than all, it is the human issue. Man is, after all, an issue. It was the closest thing to the sea and it was the closest thing to the mountain, and between them extends the horror and loss of their invisible strands over a swamp of screaming, fear and unknown. I am crying for something else. It is a real Sabbath, but there is no longer a real Friday here and no one is real. And for us you and me, just search for something under the dust of memory, and see what we found under that dust ... new dust as well. We were mistaken when we considered that the homeland is only the past, as for Khaled, the homeland is the future, and so was the separation, and thus Khalid wanted to take up arms .. Tens of thousands like Khaled do not stop them tears spoiled for men searching in the depths of their defeats for the wreck of armor and the flowering of flowers, but they are They look to the future, and so they correct our mistakes, and the mistakes of the whole world ....

":. Book review video: : //. . / = .... The first novel by Izz al-Din Shukri, and it turns out that his style really evolved a lot in. The following accounts, but it is clear that one of the first things that he started with has the ability to draw the reader&#39;s attention to the end .. The novel is as if it were compilations of writings, narrations and talk about Fakhr al-Din, a person who died and has an investigator investigating his death case by referring to his past and history after the issue strangely closed. The novel in its six parts begins with the life of Fakhr El Din in his village and then the secondary period that had a great impact on changing his personality. The university period and his studies at the Faculty of Law and the psychological, emotional, and fateful fluctuations of Fakhruddin’s life, followed by the period he spent in the army that coincided with The timing of Iraq’s occupation of Kuwait, followed by his tenure as a lawyer and his relationship to his beloved Sherine .. See through all this the personality of Fakhruddin with its advantages and disadvantages, Fakhruddin is a very ideal person, adhering to his principles that accompanied him from childhood, loving to others but his biggest flaw is his pride that cost him a lot, He even cost him his soul at the end of each narration For those who knew him, he became more like a living corpse, alive but he lost his soul .. With the end of each chapter, one of them confirms the death of the pride of religion in a different way, this may lead to some people thinking that they are talking about the different pride of each of them, but it is the same pride of religion that was killed by his disappointment in his family and their betrayal To him after the death of his mother and father, he killed him, his first companions abandoned him with the first crossroads, the selfishness of the university comrades, the cruelty of the army, the brutality of the law firm and the greed of society, that Fakhreddin died more than once. And every time I make sure that the pride of religion in one form or another represents me at some point in my life .. The novel, although it begins with a police start, is a societal novel with a political character, we see the defects of society through the pride of religion, which is not without its own flaws as well, which we sympathize With her or we decide to overlook her because we see the cruelty of the world around him .. The novel is flawed by the rapid movement from time to the second and from a personality to the other on the same page without clarifying that in most of the time, but that the words of pride of religion in most of the times are more like speeches and this is unrealistic, I felt pride Debt is ideal, sometimes too much.

"It was very unfair to say that the last version of the Temple Secrets. Is it a response from the author Paul Sussman to the novel The Da Vinci Code? After looking at and reading the two, it came out that the two followed several points, which makes the individual say that they are the same, not the opposite? . The style of the novel .. historical police where you start. With a murder that brings us to successive events from the stories and legends of Lofu and the distant past of Da Vinci&#39;s paintings, he pondered some of his paintings, as he was making fun and hard of some religious beliefs. This is the first similar point in terms of style or type of novel, to be more precise. As for events, they revolve around a religious symbol that can show the power of belief and other heroes .. Here it seems that Paul Sussman has taken the same path with a religious symbol that may be used to ignite another war if it occurs with the wrong hands. My evaluation of the novel was going to be because it from the beginning was inconsistent. The reader cannot understand the course of the event. Except when it passed for the sixth semester .. But it included information that enriches the reader very creatively, so it was evaluated by a counterpart. Cultural, religious, and historical information that is evident and which reflects experience and culture. I still think, however, that the last mysteries of the Temple surpass the Da Vinci Code, perhaps because the characters were not walking, but were swept away by events, to create an unparalleled masterpiece, unlike this narration, where the monk was. Langdon and Sophie are walking to cover up the truth or hide it, as happened with the monk

"The first novel after seeing a story to be completed by you .. By Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq I feel like I lost time. A bad novel with all its meanings. It took me a long time to pass her two months and a half. Not interesting ... and lose realism and credibility in the events ... it is not classified as a literature of terror ... and it does not deserve to be classified among the literature ... without a clear goal. When you start reading, you feel like the writer. Even the cover for fun. I felt that he was not able to collect events and not link them to each other, so he started making new personalities to avoid any need. The writer is information loss and lost sense of it. However, it lacks principles and values. It is not a condition of work in which there are expressions or suggestions, in order for them to be poor. It is also possible that he is missing principles and values and ethics, and his hour of his will will be bad. I completed the novel, and I said to myself now that you will find him familiar with the events ... Now you will fix his mistake ... but it did not happen what I expected. Noisy ... blood ... event spacing ... blood ... indispensable characters ... second blood ... failed champion ... second blood ... end of life was bad. If the writer had finished the book in a famous sentence, our hero would wake up from his sleep and he was terrified, and thank God so much that this was a nightmare that would have swallowed the novel. I did not gain anything, not even pleasure. I hope the writer has a message and a goal that he presents in his writings so that he does not lose his readers even if the goal is fun and interesting. My evaluation has a cover from end to cover / it is appreciated by the author. If you curse her away from the writer, she does not deserve a star. . The novel is presented to me as a gift on my birthday. I do not think when I started reading it, nor did I think it was done when I finished it. But I preferred that I write the reviews of their products after I completely forgot them, so that the words are not sharp or hurt to the writer

Why do you feel inferior, as if you were saying: Islam is ours, you are the birth of a dog. You say to the people: My religion is the correct one, enter in it and God will burn you. Who is the one that people understand, that our Lord is concerned that someone enters into the Islamic religion or not? Why do I feel we are supposed to demonstrate the Islamic religion? We are wandering in order to attract the largest number of les, and entice them to say and invite? Why do you want the religious people to turn into sales representatives ... they would give each other a little bit and say: Enter the debt in our merchants, and give it away. Why are we supposed to stand up and say to them: Religion, this brings a number of features and fascination?

The toilet was in need of repair, which is what we had hoped for from the staff there, but no one came to fix it. Finally the breakfast buffet was an insult to tourists / backpackers. In fact it was stupid to stay at that hotel, so we decided to leave the hotel the next morning to come after we had breakfast. And before we carry our bags and leave for another hotel we went for ten minutes to spend some money from the cash machine, and when we returned to the hotel we discovered that the hotel staff had stolen the money from our bags about a euro stolen after we calmed down a little bit we went to the reception to pay the bill and leave, and we asked them where we can find Police station to report the hotel. But they made matters worse when they refused to tell us the location of the police station. But of course we did find the police station, and we filed the complaint.

He believes in the death of the gods and calls for the superior man who until now does not know where this person will come from if there were no gods. Above all, he comes from a conservative Protestant family, where his father was a priest. Of course, I cannot deny some of the ideas that I liked, but in general ... I did not like him.

And about the theft he made to smoke cigarettes. And about the idea of suicide that I submit to. His trip to England to study, and his sect to oppose this matter. He worked as a lawyer in South Africa and was subjected to racial harassment. At the beginning of the book, I felt an enjoyment until I finished about a page quickly. But in the middle of the book, I began to feel lethargy and boredom ... especially after his departure and his family to Africa .. and not allowing his children to enroll in schools and only to teach them at home without a full-time for them ... As well as his call to the children and young Indians in South Africa to leave the study that makes them slaves and restricts their freedom .. As if he was not convinced of the importance of education except in the final chapters of the book upon his return to India. Gandhi did not know much about Islam, and his readings were limited to Christianity and Hinduism. Perhaps this was due to the lack of devotion to Muslim preachers in India and South Africa or to the scarcity of foreign books on the Islamic faith at the time .. It was mentioned that he had known many Indian Muslims .. He did not mention whether one of them influenced his thinking or not. Although Gandhi was not a Muslim. However, most of what he did and mentioned in the beginning of the book was the first for Muslims to do. Our religion urges us to do and abide by those good qualities.

"Yana, oh ... or in English? The idea of the movie is the same as the idea of the American movie that starred Jim Kerry, which is that a person lives in him two completely different characters, in the Egyptian case in which Jim Kerry was replaced by the struggle of Al-Shafi’i and Rene Zolliger Prem Baroudi, there was a very naive happy to the point of provocation and controlled by a character Another sinister appears from time to time is Hazem, while Lotfi Labib is treating him, and while Hazem is involved in several criminal acts, Saeed remains and his greatest ambition is to win a beautiful love that is played by Reem Al-Baroudi, and during the events Hazem implicates half of the other character Saeed in several things and comes out From inside to take over a piss Suddenly he wandered without Saeed&#39;s control, while the film appears weak dramatically, but it showed representative capabilities for the struggle of Al-Shafi’i, who is known for his talent. His true personality or the way he spoke, so whoever knew him with a master in Tamer and Shawqiyyah only and met him with his real personality, he would find a big surprise. Nidal showed his representational ability in several scenes in the film, the most important of which is the scene of the fight between Hazem and Saeed, and they are the same person when Hazem and his other personality, Said, beat one of them Hammamet, the reactions of the struggle was very strong And convincing to the viewer that there are two people in a fight inside one body, and the other fight that happened between them inside a nightclub at the end of the movie and the scene in which Saeed resisted a firm exit and succeeded in that, far from that, the good movie is not only a good actor, without a good story and scenario and a directing vision An insightful art, production, and make-up artist on the occasion of a happy personal haircut, there is no film, without the integration of all the elements necessary for a good movie that keeps the good actor as a million pounds.

The rhythm is very slow, and the events do not move until late after the boredom has possessed me, so I push myself to complete it without stealing my eyes and pushing me to devour the event as its previous version. Sherine advised me. The first: You have a really good narrative talent so I hope you will be very patient before any work and there is no need to rush and come up with an idea that does not offer, does not delay, does not help you, and does not benefit me as a reader. Take your time until you return to a topic and plot that only you can do ... just like everyone shocked you in the first novel.

And if we look at the romantic part of the film, especially the love story that brought Katie and Alex not going beyond the events of the movie, which was natural and supposed to be the movie is classified under romantic drama and it is the basic line on which events are based, and to complete the surprising moments, you will see the dramatic plots of the film that are totally irrational; starting from Katie&#39;s ability to escape, in addition to her constant contact with her neighbor who helped her without that ever telling her what happened to her husband after his stabbing the knife, also involving the psychological problem of Ibn Alex in the story and his suffering from the death of his mother and not exploiting that in bringing Katie to him and thus bringing her closer to The Alex family, and the author did not refer from a relative or a distant son to his father Alex, so did he cause the death of his mother, for example? Or was he treated badly? ... and in addition to all this, you are one of the first scenes that you will know the sequence of events and predict the end, what will it look like? It can be the nature of the place in which the film was portrayed was one of the goodnesses that are mentioned, and let the evaluation of the film promise, among other things, that the actor Josh Duhamel performed and presented him to the character of Alex and distinguished him with an extraordinary calm that may be appropriate for the character itself.

It is clear and clear that Zahi is originally Abdullah Thabet since I started reading, and I feel that I read Abdullah Thabet’s biography, which he wrote by himself .. Each writer has a point of view and the book will certainly be the writer&#39;s attempt to make us see that his point of view is more correct.

The rooms are in rather poor condition, for example the whole metallic paint frayed on the bathroom fixtures, bird waste on the balcony, it was so hot that the balcony was not used. The staff was rude, or did not understand what we were asking for additional pillows that required a two-day wait and demand times. The food was very average, just nutrition, not food. Breakfasts are ok, but dinner was not fun at all. Same food every day. Drinks are very expensive. TL for a small beer EUR. Hotel facilities were very good. Several swimming pools, sauna and Jacuzzi were needed because the bed was solid Turkish bath, nice gardens but services were lacking. The fantastic tour guide said that the hotel was excellent in the past. However, the German owners sold him to a local Turkish company that did not invest in the hotel. Likewise, the multilingual staff were German, Russian and British guests, and management was non-existent. Elsewhere, we found that the Turkish people were really kind and helpful, but not here

"One or two stars ??. I will put two stars ... a star: Because the suspense factor was active in this novel, as you will be able to finish it in a day or two .. This is, in my opinion, a factor that has some strength .. Another star: because the writer worked on his narration with research and investigation and this was clear more than Perhaps necessary. Now we come to the novel&#39;s weaknesses: First: The novel was overflowing with colloquialism in an exaggerated manner. I love the novels that take you in the ordinaryness of the country until it enters into the real atmosphere. Like the novel Al-Madhoun and Madame from Tel Aviv. You feel really in the hollow of Gaza between the people and the Palestinians. But here with this blue elephant. It was like a teenage novel that many words were written in English. Can you imagine such a sentence in a poker-nominated novel? . Taki ... but this is a victory ... and. . Originally, Maya was answering from him. . He is in Maadi .... Wait, I have my phone. . . Yes, it is a novel that reached the short list in Poker. Second, it appears to me that the author here was not convinced that this was a pure police novel. So he wanted to make it a power of legends, flowery words, and psycho-medical information. Love, isthmus, and death .... up to a degree that is not enough for salvation, and I arrived after the first page, praise be to God. Third: Am I the only one who felt this, or was there anyone else. He felt that the writer was practicing the muscles of his information and language, if you will, to the reader. For me, I cannot stand this act. The writer who sees himself higher than his reader, his writing becomes narcissistic. It came with new language styles and phrases, but it added nothing to the language, not even to the novel. We return to our basic point that this narration is destined to be police, not linguistic, philosophical. Also, the reader is not required to be a psychiatrist to know the meanings of the medical terms included in the novel. It would not detract from the novel that the explanatory notes were added to the aforementioned types of diseases. Although I am against mixing English with Arabic. Three stars decreased out of five ... I think I will be satisfied with this amount. The novel is light, had it not been for the preoccupations that I mentioned before

The last scenes, when Christ fell and participated mysteriously in the killing of these monks, then the appearance of comforter in the form of a lover answering the hero&#39;s existential questions in a few lines confirms to you that the writer could not answer these existential questions about death, especially after reducing all the scenes and feelings of love in sexual scenes Just as if this is the only sign of life ... the metaphysics at the end of the novel with those absurd scenes of Christ and the Comforter was a tragedy ending your reading of that novel

"I know that what I will write now may not be interested in the author of the novel nor his fans who love the novel and the film, but I write about my thoughts, ideas and questions during my reading of the novel, and that is one of the few times unfortunately that I write a review on a book whether I like it or not .. the first thing that occurred To me it was a question about the writer himself, what did Muhammad Sadiq read to write this novel? And what is now reading? And what will he read next? That question stems from my firm belief that a good writer is also a good reader. Many writers have spoken a lot about this, and they have important and inspiring articles. But the deepest and most important of them was Borges when he said simply: I do not like to sit with a book writer more than he read .. Perhaps this is a matter of good reason. If the quality of the books he read improves, then his writing improves. Or at least the books gave him new ideas, or maybe he improved his style, performance, wording and language. Many novelists around the world wrote about things that killed writing, but their formulation, and the angle they saw the story made them offer excellent books .. Anyone has the right to write whatever he wants, that freedom that allows everyone to do whatever they want. In the end, this is in our interest as readers. The presence of all shades and colors fills us with joy and happiness. But insisting on celebrating one type of literature, songs, and films reveals how bad the taste has reached .. In the same sense, you have the right to write a script, but do not write on the cover that it is a narrator, as happened here. The novel is written as if it is a movie script, but even this scenario has many shortcomings .. As for the title, there was no embarrassment and the title is just a simple problematic issue regarding what fills the novel from mistakes. The writer said that Hebta means number seven in the Greek language. First there is no longer what is called the Greek language, it means the Greek language. Secondly, the number is pronounced Epta in a thousand, not a distraction. Third, after reading the novel, I wonder about the relationship of the title to the content. The title of the novel is just like this. The reader must discover that it is seven stages of love. What is the relationship of Greek love and its stages? Why the Greek language in particular? I do not know. But the only answer is to preserve the requirements of marketing and advertising. An attractive and strange title must be chosen .. In the end, I say that these famous bad books have a terrible negative effect on the talented writers as a real talent. It makes them feel that everything that they write, read and do has no value in all of this. Perhaps they stopped writing because of despair. That is why I say to all talented novelists, who have not yet had the opportunity to appear and spread, that you do not underestimate and not be sad. I know that when you watch what is going on, you may get frustrated. Low-value books with valuable content are at the forefront, people read them and many talk about them and eventually turn into movies. I tell you, dear, I hope this will not make you sad. I hope you won&#39;t stop writing just because you can&#39;t keep up with the prevailing general climate that encourages bad and bad. I tell you that people&#39;s tastes change, as everything changes. This general climate will change for the better after a while, it is only a matter of time .. You should know that in the nearly forties there was a novelist named Ismail Wali Al-Din filling the world and working people, and his novels turned into movies. Naguib Mahfouz did not know then a few. Now what is left of Ismail Wali Al-Din? Several bad commercial movies? And where did he write? Is anyone reading to him now?

The area is very far away from entertainment, desired malls, disturbing cars, road works, entry and exit very busy. I lived in many hotels in Dubai, the worst double Tree Hilton, and I wish everyone the attention and not to go down at all.

"I came back with my review ...:. I am always wary of many books that meet a great boom and echo, and this is based on many books I read because of the uproar around them, then I discover that they do not deserve all of this in my view. We say this is my personal opinion. But I allow myself to give the opportunity to such books, so perhaps they deserve all that and more, and some books have proven as well ... But I have noticed that the majority of these books harvest this noise from the general readership because they touch something inside a person, touch his feelings or suffering and start to manipulate the feeling On the surface, one of us would like it, but if many of them were subjected to a fair evaluation, why would these works not be huge? This book I see is a book closer to the commercial, which tickles the religious senses of others and presents a utopian image of a person’s relationship with his Lord, and completely ignores a person’s relationship with his community .. I can say With a mouthful of narration that narrates the horizon narrow, and the judgments that it claims Miqa, it is essentially superficial and contradictory ... The writer drops the story of the miserable wife Ella who lost much of her soul after a exhausted life of caring for a husband and caring for the children and then met her dear when she decided to search for work on the love story that Rumi and Tabrizi fought in her words ... the narration The novelist and the syntax are excellent, the style is smooth and enjoyable and very fit when you lose fitness in reading. Hold this book until it paves you back to reading again ... I am not skilled in literary criticism, but I will write my abstract opinion:. The work is not that strong enough to fuss this noise .. It frankly misses a lot .. A very consuming and boring idea .. It does not arouse any enthusiasm for me .. The only good thing is to link the past to the present and this leads us to criticize the historical aspect that I see very weak in this novel. There is no strong historical history or observation of that period, the novelist could leapfrog the novel to higher levels by supporting the historical side in a deeper way than the surface in which it was taken up ... And whoever recites Azazel and the Granada trilogy or the narrator of Cordoba will fully realize the weakness of its historical side ... One of the advantages of fictional work for me is that no one conquers his idea, unlike books Intellectual or objective .. dialogues and you can choose what suits you and each in his opinion right and wrong, but this novel felt that the victory of the idea of mysticism is very present .. it always highlights that the last word of the sun and his thoughts. The ideas of others are presented in a way that appears wrong and superficial. There is a lot of exaggeration in that ... So I say that the horizon of the novel is very narrow .. and contradictory .. People are two classes: a hard-liner who loves pleasure or worship governs by appearance ... Tabrezi&#39;s category: love and love and outside is excluded even if you drink wine ... a childish and naive idea, not From Sufism in something .. It promotes that Islam is just that way, as depicted by Shams who is in the novel, and besides that they are ignorant and lost much of Islam .. This is a kind of madness and contradiction and I only show you what I see ... It is not reasonable to ask others That they do not make judgments regarding our actions and that this is only between us and God, but man is present in a society and his actions most of which affect this community A Pei or willing .. The Quran came with individual, community, political, military, and family organizations. You cannot separate yourself from society. Then you say, I will drink a glass of wine and I will practice sweet disbelief and then promote it as the ideal Islam. Yes, I strongly believe that there are behaviors that we have nothing to do with it, as it is between the servant and his Lord, as long as it does not affect society or my freedom as an individual .. But the flattening of the idea in this narration is the one that I reject ... Therefore, I say that the horizon of the novel is narrow and does not present the pure image of Sufism Rather, Sufism presents its most naive form ... The truth is that after reading it for a long time, I slowly began to hate: What does this narration want? What do I need to deliver? None of what was mentioned in the introduction to the book did not convince me that there is none of that which profoundly communicated or presented .. no love, no love, no worship ... unjustified reverence for the relationship of Shams and Rumi is strange? There is contempt for the rest of humanity in an indirect and perhaps unintended way .. The sun and those like it are the mystics in this narration who were able to reach very high levels of spirituality that would not be understood by the simple people who look to Islam without what is seen by those who dance and rotate and then their souls are united at levels Etc. etc. Then there are many nodal fallacies that I cannot yet pass safely ... What does it mean if the adopted child in Rumi House watches you see dead souls and talks to them as if they have. On other worlds ... Then there are a good number of transgressions that have no origin but flaws ... As for the forty rules of love itself, the rule of rule is not new or an invention from the writer, but I can say that the writer failed to include the rules in the template of the novel .. The topic turned into a lecture and indoctrination .. as if they were numbered paragraphs to be included .. In the sentences, the inclusion of the rules was very, very weak and not appropriate for the fictional work. Therefore, I say work is a novelist that is not good at all and does not deserve that commotion, but it caresses our feelings through religious thoughts that contain many fallacies so that we assume that we really agree with everything and that we are tired of the intervention of others and their narrow view of our relationship with our Lord while we are part of all the characters in the novel ... ... we judge, narrow and expand worship, how we want and then we read a book that simulates emotion only so we tend to it and believe that we are always the victim ... the book is a weak summary of those who will read it with a mind and heart, and will discover from the first quarter the shallowness of the historical and eclectic aspect in it. I do not advise you to read it without reading Sufism from several references and without reading about Al-Roumi and the history of that period ... In the end, in the book are good things that we take and return the rest ..

At the same time, I do not criticize this for foreign writers, so that this is their life, and that is their thoughts and beliefs .. I know that it is the freedom of the writer, but I think that the writer is like a writer with an Islamic religion that shoulders himself with what I call an intellectual awakening so the writer should not forget His religion is called literature.

"Classics of disputed love. Four main models in the novel: the female characters in the novel enjoy strength compared to the male characters in which submission, submission, clear surrender, crushing under the weight of external societal, political, and introverted circumstances and the inability to make decisions are feast .. Eid and Sylvia The love between a Muslim and a Christian who is met with refusal to resort to satisfying him despite all Something in spite of the nose of the family, society and religion .. And Mary and the dreamer writer who is vocal about everything, even God, is an example of love that he fears .. neither does he want to preserve him nor does he want to break from him .. He is a model for the person who fears for his love so much of everything and decides not to commit Towards him To me at all, even if he is full as a thief or as a bat, afraid of darkness being exposed by him .. Mary is the opposite of the writer .. realistic .. wise .. crazy .. sad and angry sometimes and happy sometimes .. Eid in the opposite of the writer tried in every way to take a legitimate path For his love, even if he abandoned his religion, the sub-characters in the novel were truncated, incomplete at all, as if they were used as a filling for the events of the scarce novel and a contribution to speeding up its monotony ... despite the influence of society and the political climate in the background of the events as it sensed it; and its impact on The characters of the story that suffer the defeat, but it came as a little separate from the events though His close relationship. I would have liked the writer to have paid a little attention to this part .. Ibn Arabi, the cordon of jasmine and the mystical atmosphere that was appearing lightly. I would have liked to have elongated a lot, but he gave the novel a special glow and a transparent spiritual dimension .. There is no doubt that the scattered sexual details caused a lot of distress and distracted me. About integrating into events .. In my opinion, part of the writer&#39;s creativity is to convey to his reader the feeling he wants without using an explicit or detailed description of sexual scenes, and without causing alienation from the rest of the novel as a whole. This has been preceded by many writers who succeeded in developing using the most exemplary, gentle and sweet words, which give the suggestion without provoking imagination or putting images in mind without permission or prior preparation, especially since I consider that the reader during the novel is without other types of intellectual books that require Realizing the mind with her delivers somewhat his imagination and mind to the writer, so he inclines the characters and identifies with them. The writer should also respect those who read to him and take into consideration the quality of his reader with different directions of readers and the general character of the committed Arab reader .. In general, I was not convinced of it as a novel, perhaps because of the recurring narration technique in letters that sometimes send boredom and which inspired me that I am only opening a memoir book To read from him, no narrated novel related to the events .. It is as in the subtitle on the cover .. Letters .. Despite the beauty of the language, the transparency of words and the beautiful judgment of life .. However, there are incomplete things .. Finally: it is not among the novels that I can recommend to others.

"Under the slogan of independent cinema, you must do what you want afterward. The genius of the first experience lies in the difference in innocence in smoothness, and this was done by the editor, director, and director Ahmed Abdullah completely in his first experience. Heliopolis movie. This film, which belongs to the so-called independent cinema, that cinema that came to light in search of freedom Outside the grip of major production companies. In Heliopolis, the difference in everything was in the scenario, lighting, montage, sound, and sometimes acting. Ahmed Abdullah and his team succeeded in breaking several tabs on top of which was the movie scenario, as the film is almost without a story, and there is no dramatic conflict in it or any climax, and the characters are completely superficial. Unpainted, you move on paper and you remain trapped during the movie without meaning or aim, causing you to be affected. The lighting of the film is a miraculous rebellious thing, which is only flawed because it is not present in the internal scenes and sometimes not in the external scenes. As for the stranger, it is the montage, as the director of the work has experience in the field of montage, and when he made his first movie as a director and wrote his story and his scenario, he chose a story for four separate dramatic strings that he only collects in Heliopolis. It is known that such quality needs a very sensitive and accurate montage to make The viewer does not feel the transition from one thread to the next, but from the seemingly long-term difference, the moves were terrifying at times, uncomfortable at all times. So here the difference ends and the innocence adopted by the director in the performance of his actors begins and everyone falls into the trap of inattention, except for a little. Khaled Abu Al-Naja is a spotlight in the film with his smooth and convincing performance. Hanan Mutawa led a character who almost drew well within the limits of the amputated character dramatically, even if the error is not her fault Hani Fair unconvincing performance and an attempt to perform the introverted personality by looking at the land and hum for the degree of illness Yusra al-Lawzi is still satisfied with her beautiful face only on the screen, but the rest of the staff performed as far as possible, even if Ahmed Abdallah&#39;s insistence on the silence of the soldier Muhammad Barkaa the unreasonable in many cases his silence He damaged the dramatic streak of the soldier as a whole and made him a short film inside the film, and the genius that they announced did not appear in these scenes. And it remains smooth to transfer this independent film to the film strips to be displayed in theaters under the independent movie slogan, as if that sentence should be after. If the possibilities of this cinema do not allow all of this, and we have to overlook it in order to move to another level on the ladder of independent cinema, it remains to shout at the filmmakers all the amount of boredom that inhabited the film from its inception until the end of it to the extent that even the sympathizers of the first experience lost their sympathy. Finally, Heliopolis remains alive, and the film is not a wonderful life. Its history cannot be reduced to the time of foreigners, the fifties and earlier, and the new millennium in a humiliating shorthand for about forty years from the history of the neighborhood and Egypt as a whole. A final note: When making a movie about Heliopolis, please refer to laughing, playing, grandfathering and love for Tariq Al Tlemceni, and in the apartment of Heliopolis for Muhammad Khan.

"Excerpts from the novel &quot;The Rules of the Forty Love&quot; by Elif Shafak. . She knew that their relationship was not deep, but she said to herself that it is not necessary for the emotional bond to occupy a priority in the list of married couples, especially for a married couple, a long time has passed since their marriage. The divine things that any husband may offer is forgiveness, but love is secondary compared to all these things unless one lives in the folds of novels or romantic films where heroes always depict larger people from life and their love is nothing but a myth. . As if you can get to know a man’s personality during eight months. My father and I have been married for twenty years, and yet we cannot pretend that one of us knows everything about the other that eight months is not considered anything in any relationship. . The twenty-first century does not differ much from the thirteenth century and they will note in history that these two centuries were an era of religious conflicts to an unprecedented extent and an era in which cultural misunderstanding and a general feeling of insecurity and fear of the other prevailed and in such times the need is To love more severe than ever. . When you kill someone, something of him transmits to you a sigh, smell, or gesture. I hang them around my neck like hidden necklaces. I feel they are firmly and heavily above my flesh. Even though I do not feel comfortable, I used to live with this burden and accepted it as part of my work. Since Cain killed Abel, in every killer the man who killed him breathes, this is what I know and it does not bother me. . . Inside each person there is a hidden desire to kill one of them one day, and people do not realize this until after they have spoken to them, they think that they are unable to kill, but the issue is a matter of conscience only. Sometimes a mere gesture is enough to inflame their anger. One is in the wrong place and at the wrong time, as destructive tendencies can appear in people who are kind and respectful people in normal circumstances, as anyone can kill anyone, but no person can deliberately kill a stranger. . Believe me, there is nothing new. I have clients from the most parts of the world. After dosing some cups, I hear the same stories from all of them. People are themselves everywhere, the same food, the same water, and the same old folly. . The way in which we see God is only a reflection of the way we see ourselves, so if God did not bring to our minds nothing but fear and blame, then this means that a great deal of fear and blame is flowing in our souls, but if we see God filled with love and mercy, we will be like that. . This is how life is. When you tell someone the truth, he hates you, and the more you talk about love, the more it hates you. . Whatever we are or wherever we live, we feel in our hearts that we are incomplete, as if we lost something and must recover it, but most of us never find that thing. As for those who can find it, very few dare to go out and search for it. . Do not judge the way people communicate with God, so each person has his own way and prayers that God does not take us with our word, but looks in the depths of our hearts and not the rites or rituals that make us believers, but whether our hearts are pure or not. . One of the things that helped me personally in the past to stop interfering in the affairs of others around me and when I was frustrated months that I would not be able to change them I was instead of intrusion or negativity I was inclined to acquiescence some people mistake when they mix between compliance and weakness, so compliance is a form of peaceful acceptance On the terms of the universe, among which are things that we cannot currently change or understand. . Thought and love consist of different materials. Thought binds humans in a contract, but love dissolves all nodes. Thought always warned, and he advises: Beware a lot of euphoria, while love says: Do not care. I take this risk and while thought cannot fade. Easily, love collapses easily and becomes a rubble on its own, but the treasures are hidden between rubble and the broken heart hides treasures. . Most of the world&#39;s problems stem from linguistic errors and from a simple misunderstanding that does not take words in their apparent meaning at all, and when the circle of love enters, the language that we know is outdated. The thing that cannot be expressed in words can only be perceived by silence. . Loneliness and being alone are two different things. When you are alone, it is easy to fool yourself and imagine that you are on the right path. As for being alone is better for us because it means being alone without feeling that you are alone, but in the end it is better for you to search for someone who is like a mirror You remember that you cannot really see yourself except in someone else&#39;s heart and with God in you. . No matter what happens in your life, and no matter how troublesome things appear, do not enter despair, and even if all the doors remain closed, God will open a new path for you. Ahmed, your Lord, it is easy for you to praise God when everything is fine. The Sufi praises God not only for what He granted to him, but praises Him Also for everything that God has forbidden it. . Patience does not mean that you bear the difficulties negatively, rather it means being far-sighted so that you trust the end result that will result from any process. What does patience mean? It means that you look at the thorn and see the rose, you look at the night and see the dawn. As for impatience, it means that you are short-sighted and you cannot see the result that God&#39;s lovers never run out of patience because they know that in order for the crescent to become full, it needs time. . There is no big difference between east and west, south and north. Whatever your destination, you must make the journey you take a journey inside you. If you travel inside you, you will be able to cross the vast world and beyond. . When the midwife finds that the pregnant woman does not suffer during labor, she knows that the path is not clear for her newborn, so she will not give her newborn if and in order to generate a new soul, it must be pain and just as the clay needs high heat to intensify, love is not complete except with pain. . The pursuit of love changes us, so no one seeks love and matures during his journey, so when the search for love begins, it starts to change from inside and outside. . There are fake teachers and fake professors in this world with many stars in the visible universe. Do not confuse selfish people who are motivated by power and true teachers. An honest spiritual teacher directs your attention to him and does not expect absolute obedience or complete admiration from you but rather helps you to appreciate yourself The Ministry of the Interior respects that true teachers are as transparent as crystal passing through God&#39;s light through them. . Because you are very keen to obtain the approval of others, you will not get rid of their criticism, whatever you try. . Do not try to resist the changes that stand in your way, but let life live in you and do not worry if you turn your life upside down so how do you know that the side you are used to is better than the side that will come. . I do not think that there is a problem with sadness, but rather the opposite is hypocrisy that makes people happy. As for the truth, it makes them feel sad. . The true filth lies inside, while the other filth is removed by washing, and there is one type of filth that cannot be cleansed with pure water, which is a pollute of hatred and intolerance that pollutes the soul. . If a person wants to change the way in which people treat him, he must first change the way in which he treats himself and if he does not learn how to love himself completely and sincerely, there is no way in which he can love, but when he reaches that stage he will thank every thorn that others have thrown at him. This indicates that Roses will rain down soon, then how can one blame others for not respecting him if he does not consider himself worthy of respect. . The past is a vortex, if you let it dominate your present moment, it will absorb you and sweep you away from what time is but an illusion and all you need is to live this very moment. This is all that matters. . Do not care where the road will lead you, but focus on the first step, as it is the most difficult step that you must take responsibility for. Once you take that step, let everything happen naturally and the rest will come by itself. Do not go with the current, but be the current. . The Internet has exaggerated behavior outside its scope and made it gentle, giving the opportunity to flirt without having to feel guilty and adventurous without risk, as if to eat delicious food forbidden without worrying about you due to the extra calories. . How can love be so serious?

I had never known before reading it as an educational book. I thought he would talk about the pleasure of reading that reaches the point of addiction. Be fascinated by all those lines contained in books. And the constant passion for ending more and more of them and digesting them well. As a worm read, I expected this book to be a fun dose. Inside, I will find those who share in me madness, passion, intimacy and love for reading. But he was discussing the problem of dyslexia. And compare it to television and cinema. Imposing parents to read to become a boring task like hell. Really, all prohibitions are desirable. He went on to describe the boy’s torture as he tried to end that heavy imposition. Wow, he had to call the book the torture of reading or the inferno of reading. It is not a pleasure to read. The last part is about the rights of the reader. You will agree with him in some of them and will differ with him in others. But in the end, reading is life. Reading is a special lifestyle, a pure personal journey. Better to fight it alone without a guide. You discover it yourself, with your own mind without determining your last view of it. Create your own laws of what you see as right and preferred. What you deem unpalatable. You have the right to re-read, jump on pages or other rights. They are flexible rights, and it is you who grant and give them as soon as you start reading the book. When the book becomes your slave, the writer says. Overall, quite a bit. Small but despite his smallness some boredom. It is best to read it as an educational book.

The writer was hoping to create a state of mystery and anticipation, and that the beloved would be wrapped in thick fog, making everyone who read the book think that it was the intended one, and everyone who read the book thought that his beloved was the intended one. . So we communicate with the personality through ourselves. But the mistake I made is the extent of the mistiness of this character, as unlike all the characters who were real her character was like the ghost character, foggy and unrealistic as I could not as a woman communicate with him. Or even to try to liken it myself. A character never touched reality, so the clips that were the least attractive to me were the clips that remembered her.

"Yesterday I finished reading the novel by myself and others by Jana Fawaz. The novel reminded me of the stories of Nawal Al-Saadawi. The female doctor’s notes are the origin that I read surreptitiously in my childhood. Yes, I was nine years old when I read Is it the type of book? The important thing is that we return to the novel. The story talks about a woman who suffers from the bad treatment of her husband and beat him to her, and how she escaped from this by entering into a forbidden relationship with a married man who finds the lost love with him. In the novel, the author reviews various stories of women: her mother, who lives with a sexually cold husband, her widowed friend, who was betrayed by love when death kidnapped her husband, and she quenched her instinct with temporary relationships with men, and the story of her aunt who died a virgin because she loved a man her father refused to marry. And other stories all revolve around the axis of women who are emotionally abused, physically stolen, and morally degenerate. The story is not as bad as I expected. After I read the account of attention to AlbertoMoravia, I did not find this novel bolder. The narration in the novel is traditional. The raving element is missing at the end of the novel. The events are realistic and may happen in any country or time .. We read them on the pages of Nawal El Saadawi and here we read them on the pages of Jana. Al-Rawya focused on raising the problems facing women, but it failed to find enough solutions. I wished we had a clearer end, better solutions, or good examples. We felt it was okay.

I discuss ideas, accuracy of transmission, correctness of information, presentation style, and writer style. Or do I set the record straight and say that this book is just another nonsense from what Ahmed Khalid writes? While I might like the book a little, it is still light in shade. However, I will not consider it a book in the full sense of the word. It is just thoughts. The writer saw that he had a good cultural kit that would qualify him to write on a subject of such importance, so he took advantage of his name and fame, and his many followers, who might buy even blank papers, just because his name is on them, so he took advantage of his luxury and decided to write this thing that I do not know him So far any precise name .. I have no objection at all to the idea of simplifying things a little, on the contrary, it is a good idea in any case. But to seek your enormous imagination and add things that have nothing to do with existence and call this a summary of the most important philosophical ideas, this is the defect. Here it is, nothing, pure bullshit. It can make any passionate reader interested in knowing philosophy be satisfied forever and pastoralize just thinking about it again. Are you talking about foolishness? Or about the fallacies in the book? Or about the intense fooling of great ideas that are still fueling discussions in any intellectual arena? Or am I talking about the writer&#39;s disdain for his readers and distorting everything? In general, the book is ridiculous, full of fools, and never deserves neither the trouble of reading, nor the trouble of writing about it, but my anger from wasting my time decided to take revenge .. This book is a somewhat misrepresentation and distortion of the novel of a Sufi scholar, but of course in the form of a brief summary and disgraceful as well. Again, another attempt with books that simplify philosophy sarcastically is doomed to failure .. I think this is the main reason, if you want to write then try even a little bit to stick to the sources and references. And not to deviate from the context of science and literature as well, but mockery and satire do not make me eager, of course, to read.

In the auto club narration, it was on a few pages about the sommelier and the events of the bar, but as a reader I forgot it, I saw it in front of me. But here it faded. The rest of the events, personalities and style are very normal. Not on the level of Tuya and the guide disappointed me. The novel&#39;s music is beautiful.

"To start with, I do not see the book as an anecdotal collection, and its texts are closer to blogging articles or blogging articles as they are called. This does not rule out the existence of some anecdotal texts that bear a sincere feeling, and I think this is what distinguishes the author most. However, the mixing of the style of blogging with the style of fictional writing led to something similar to water dilution, so the book became more lean. Does this mean that blogging weakens the language? This depends on the author&#39;s view of him. Among the writers is someone who respects writing in all cases and looks at blogs as channels for publication, so he writes faithfully what he writes in paper books. But many view it as a white card that allows the author to license everything and override the language on the pretext that these are not literary texts; these are notations. . I suffered in the book from abundant linguistic mistakes, mistakes everywhere and everything, even in the simplest of rules. I suspect that the reason is the weakness of the writer&#39;s language and the book&#39;s reviewers as well, as long as all these errors have gone under their noses without noticing. For example, how does a writer in Al-Fusha who like to say that one eyebrow is raised and does not feel stabs in his ears like? And, worse, how can he do this twice in the same book, separated by only a few pages; the same phrase with the same two errors? . This is a simple example, and the mistakes are not only in grammar, but in many linguistic and verbal methods. She says, for example, in a position: I put my leg under me and it is a very colloquial expression in the wrong’s way, so what is this from me that puts its leg under it? It is nice that Rehab writes in Arabic far from colloquially, while she originally studied it in English literature, meaning that she has something that might motivate her to write in English, but I would like her to be more jealous of the Arabic that she preferred.

". Ostensibly, the novel is divided into two parts. The first part of it is related to his father, mother, and illness, and the disease is the weak link from which the writer moves to the second part of the jinn and demons to the end of the multiple horror features that he put in order to attract everyone, and I see that this multiplication reflected negatively on the novel. In the first line that started the novel, a very simple problem appears that almost completely bled the novel out of its roots, which is the hero’s injury with Coro’s disease, due to the fact that the writer is not a specialist or only satisfied with the information available on this disease on Wikipedia until you find the text transmission from the site, And to avoid this loophole and put a weak possibility of suffering from this very rare disease that does not exist in Egypt, it is not by eating the flesh of his father’s body but by eating his father’s brain and that his father traveled to Guinea or let us say to Africa in general. The events pass to find the beginning of the transformation and the emergence of the second line of the novel, which is surprising, I find no justification in its existence from the ground, especially after having good lines for the direction of the first regardless of its gaps, but it is clear that there is consensus at the present time that the book does not achieve the highest sales Or fame, unless he belongs to the literature of horror or in other words, the current fashion of writing is the literature of horror, and I do not reduce these words from the literature of horror or the talented book in it, but I am a fan of it and if I see that this subject has psychological and social conclusions of our own as Egyptians. It is clear to what extent the writer has been affected by Western culture, especially in horror movies and series. I found a series. . He imposes himself on my mind with too much force. The point where the child put his hands in his ear and murmured with the melody of a song, I felt that it came out of me from a medium-rated horror movie. I find it inappropriate for our society or the social class to which the hero is supposed to be attributed. How many points in this part more than mentioned. .

And since prison owners fall within the same topic, it is necessary to point out the vast differences between Arab and foreign writers, despite the differing circumstances of the two versions ..

"First, it is a satirical act unlike my other texts, a satirical and sad work that employs the report&#39;s form and tries to make it an artistic form. In each of the twelve reports included in the book, a woman is called R, a personality is different in her circumstances, she is a mother of ten children at one time and one child at one time, a researcher here and a simple employee there ... etc., but she is always behind, because the characters complete with their reports a testimony about a moment in time Sad, surprising and ironic. All the writings of the book, including those of me, Radwa, are also shared by its various circumstances in sensitivity and alienation from a surprising, ridiculous and sad reality. The publisher wanted to call it a fictional set, because I said it was not a novel. In fact, they are separate texts that complement each other. It is, however, despite the relative critical silence, an experience I love. . This is what Dr. Radwa said about her book Mrs. R&#39;s reports. Radwa Ashour is Radwa Ashour, concerned with politics, enchanted with literature, preoccupied with history and identity, and in these reports specially add her writings with a pleasant caress that sometimes accompanies you with a pure smile on your apartment while moving between her reports .. Dr. Radwa goes and comes through her book The reports of the woman behind smoothly and smoothly, she travels From Africa, America and Europe, as you move through the times with remarkable lightness, and it does not give you the opportunity to marvel, but rather your exchange, informative and justified, I hope the reader will not be confused, because writing in modernity allows for a time shift, so the writer, especially in the first reports, is present with her scientific, cognitive and real weight .. three Only. They are only three reports who insisted on clinging to my mind after finishing a page book. Do you not notice that it is a strange coincidence that the number of pages of the book in the model of the vehicle of Mrs. Ra Fiora / Victory come from a small size in about three hours or more than about half an hour, except The three reports for reasons that did not attract me .. In Mrs. R’s reports on Cambridge with two domains, the academic professor with the attendant childhood presence of Mrs. R will prevail over all phases of Radwa, and while you find her sympathizing with the empire that the sun set off on and where the first Cambridge is located, you will find that she does not care about the country of Cambridge The second one Always repeat with her Iraq and Palestine and other matters ... The mother is reflected in the sad report, sparking the struggle of generations, while Radwa Tamim expressed her admiration for Jamila Boubacha, defending her and the beauty of the Algerian revolution, answering her is your generation ...?, The same generation that expelled the French once again Other, the million martyrs multiplied .. Then .. Then the funeral, and what a report, O Radwa, that the head was exhausted from the many questions and inquiries that I did not know about the kings of our bright bright people .. Kings are from the deaths of Gregorian and noble understanding ..

Why is this unjustified depiction of Aleppo glory, originality, history, art and flowers as a focus of sex, homosexuality and sin?

Writer&#39;s combinations are delicious, but has literature of our time needing sex as a permanent partner to succeed? Did Khaled Khalifeh not be able to steer clear of this unjustified verbiage and seek from him with simple hints or just insinuations, the reader will understand the intended meaning ... two stars no more than one for the aesthetic narration and the second for the writer’s beautiful language at times away from its sexual content.

"The first time in my life I read a page novel and it remains boring and in the end a bad novel from all directions. I don&#39;t know the review, a little long, but to burn my blood from wasting my time in the novel. First: They talk about the Sadat period, the high prices, the peace and openness treaty, and sectarian strife represented by an employee who takes money in order to inform the workers of the company to receive Sadat and his guests. All this is fine. We are also annoyed by the terms of the peace treaty and visiting Jerusalem, but what burns my blood is that most of the novelists are supporters who work as novels and look On the misfortune of Sadat’s period, and no one in two articles does anything about any need for the Nasiriyah period, which is repression, forgery, ending democracy, purely misleading media, the loss of Sinai, and other needs .... It means what was written in the novel on state security and that the corrupt hero of the novel was caught in January Lissa intifada forces means the repression Mafeesh good story of one of the first told by grep Khamis and executed for her Gaahahaddat Kamshish Tjapelln. Ok, the workers are looking for money that is not well known. I am not aware of Za’al Abdel Nasser, so I want a busy reception when he came back from Bandung. We talked about the Socialist Union and the pioneer organization and their role… Many other needs, but the Nazarenes see corrupt needs during the era of Sadat. He doesn’t go through, and we also see the same needs but we will see violations And corruption during the era of Nasser works from which myths are not novel. Second: Every bit in the novel, the hero speaks to himself and discharges, and says words where he went, and God, and how he guided us to his paradise, so how did he abandon us? Then he says an idiot. Words he meant and I do not want to say what I do not know. And a little owner says to the hero, it is necessary to marry, you will work as a fighter Lenin, I will marry, and we will go far, why Abdel Nasser is married, and the Prophet Muhammad hit the record What is the matter? We will see the messenger need shit. Third: Every page is narrated in the cam line of a story and no click, I do not understand the required talent, and do not understand what I want to say. It was possible to perform two stars because of the manifestations of corruption in the life that he said during the era of Sadat. Indeed, they existed, but for the reasons I mentioned last, the last star, and there was no zero.

"The book that I read just before this book is Egypt’s book between the Islamic state and the secular state, and it is a debate about Islamic and secular thought. The Islamic team represents Sheikh Muhammad Al-Ghazali and the secular team Faraj Fouda. In the debate, Faraj Fouda’s answers were few and in my opinion they need clarification, so I touched on another book which is this The book in order to see his idea separately and judge it objectively with the logic I heard and read and not only heard ... It is worth noting that I did not find any insult or appeal against religion, but I found an appeal in the companions questioning the belief ... So what are you waiting for more than that? The book explains the truth that is absent from achieving the Islamic caliphate, and what will happen if it is achieved and the mechanisms to achieve it, will it succeed in solving the state&#39;s problems economically, socially, religiously ... and so on. The writer confirms his ideas during the period of Sayyidina Uthman and after that the killing of Uthman, a mandate for the rule of the Umayyads, the rule of the Abbasids. Some Umayyad and Abbasid rulers mentioned separately ... But: The clarifications that the writer referred to during this period did not add to the balance of my knowledge anything because it is a period that no one knows about it and many interpretations abound that a so-and-so hero is a serial killer ... and he mentioned this period Either clarifies: that the Islamic religion is not static that its teachings, orders, and intentions cannot be taken as a divine thing that cannot be changed and that it changes with time by virtue of the period in which we live .. and it has been expressed that usury is permissible in cases and is not considered static. Or, either he makes clear: Islam is not a religion and a state, and that Islam is in Alain and the state is our life and what we can do or change with our hands, and he explained this by mentioning the ugliness of the actions of some Umayyad or Abbasid caliphs ... and he was inflicted upon our master Uthman himself ... what excites me that he talks about a period Mysterious, no one is sure about what happened with her and confirms his views during this period .. And I say if this period is mysterious, how can you build on it the foundations and ideas ..? With the idea of the Islamic state that they are unable to set up a program to run this country, which is for It puts a secular program to see a secular state. .

In my opinion, the topic that I wrote in all these lines is originally not of that magnitude that requires writing in it, especially with his association with the man and the woman and the relationship between them, which the writer sanctified in all her malevolence until I made it a condition upon which life is based. ..And she is seeking help from God and inviting Him to forget about women steeped in consecutive love relationships, forgetting the opinion of religion itself in similar relationships and its illegitimacy before marriage. It is an indifferent dare in my opinion and merely the absurdity of a group&#39;s philosophy in a book sold at a high price.

The important thing is Marwan is kidnapped and does a certain task in Palestine and in the end they change his name and identity and flee to Switzerland .. The tale is empty. Of course, it was necessary to burn some events in order to clarify the general atmosphere of the novel and the reason for the lack of plot, even if the one who burned it did not live from the novel. The important. The novel feature has two needs. The most wonderful style for a young writer, and this is his first novel. The second need is the last part of the novel that took place in Palestine. This was the real fun part. The disadvantages of the novel are many, but some of them can be overlooked as the novel is the writer&#39;s first work. First, the dialogue at the beginning of the novel, the writer made a mistake in it, and I found it previously in youth novels more than once .. It is a topic that mentioned the names of the two parties to the dialogue within the dialogue. This makes the dialogue appear as if it is a dialogue with a translated or dubbed movie. ..But this point gradually disappeared in the second text of the novel, and it almost disappeared in the last part. The second disadvantage is that the characters are not adequately drawn. Most of the characters came out very superficial..and many personalities appeared and disappeared unnecessarily. The third defect I mentioned earlier is that there is no plot. The novel can be divided into separate stories. The fourth disadvantage is the lack of consistency of events at a certain rate. Sometimes the events are very fast, sometimes they are very slow. Despite all of this, the novel is good. The beautiful style of the narration and the standard language compels me to overcome defects and I say that the work is good. The novel, compared to other youth novels, is ranked higher than many of the idiots who gained fame and deserved approval. Waiting for other works and better development, God willing

Regardless of the fact that Saramago wrote the novel as a kind of satisfying his atheistic desire to ridicule the idea of God in general and everything that God has done to humans and humans in the past, and in a manner that is completely devoid of any fitness and violent irony, the style of the novel is really modest and its path is very straightforward mixes the evangelical facts Much of the author’s work and fantasy of the author, and in a way that makes it difficult for you to know the facts in the middle of all this, except that we go back and remember that the author originally did not write the novel to recount historical facts but only for crude irony ... let alone that the translation of Saleh secular and what a strange thing is very modest and surprisingly literal, The text block itself contains a report None of any text formatting or punctuation, and the dialogues are mixed with the narration in a very confusing and inconvenient way to read ... The novel is written by one of the beginners atheists, who are overly spreading to them childhood atheism groups, and it seems that most of the intellectuals come at this point of divine and release their entire stock.

It is said that this means a terrifying description. And the dog run-over is a routine, we heard it a lot and became very consumed. Moreover, when his friend said, “Look, Joseph turned to him.” The author did not even mention the reason for paying attention. I mean, he mentioned anything, any details, but it was just that we were told that the dog was the genie and that obvious thing that needed to be mentioned .. his snake accident and Yasser refused to go to the doctor on the pretext of what he says to him? The words and irons are not convincing. When the family of Yusuf was burned and moved to an apartment, and after the problems Yusuf and Yasser went through with the residents of the room, Yasser posed the idea of leaving the room, and Yusuf objected on the pretext of his family’s financial condition. Ok and fella harvested from the mother tree or the family&#39;s material status. They were allowed to buy it. As for the end, how did the snake inhabit Yasser’s body because he killed her father, brother, Scorpio and Mouse? Disaster and smash the meaning of suspense and excitement.

If you have not seen porno before, I will write to you a detailed description of one of the most important sections of porno ... . For the sake of ignorant people like your readers or viewers ... When any reader criticizes any book because of the presence of sex in it, the writer’s response is often in the following sentence that sex is an important part of our lives and the objected reader is a psychopath and needs treatment ... I ask Here .. and why the writer is not a psychopath who vomits his disordered sexual fantasies on the pages of the book and gives them to the teenage reader and the prostitute reader alike? . but not . The great writer could not be wrong, but rather the fault of an ignorant, open-minded reader, like me, that he does not understand literature. Well ... I am an ignorant person and do not understand literature ... The author is a literary masterpiece and a poem in the love of the sacred race .... So what about the sentence that opened my review? . The virtuous prostitute, and please do not ask how to be a prostitute and virtuous at the same time. The question to someone other than God is humiliating, my brother. The virtuous prostitute has a mythical theory that she has no objection to granting her vagina to everyone who donates and bears, but no one has the right to accept her except her lover ... No, by God ? Really? Are kisses not part of the body? . I don&#39;t understand is a bitch selling her body and not selling her soul? Or is her soul only focused on her lips? Then what about her vagina? Does her lover have the right to pierce him, or does her spiritual lover only have to touch her lips? . Any nonsense, no shit.

Third: It makes the reader spin in an endless maze, as it sometimes talks about the present and another time in the past, which makes the reader not know where he is in the past of an aura or its present.

"The idea of the book I liked .. To read about the topic of what was written by a person who lives the experience is very different .. But after I finished the first chapter almost I felt a kind of boredom .. The sentences are repeated as if the writer wanted to pass his ideas in more than one way to ensure their arrival and give them the desired effect .. Abhor the tribalism, the method of forming it for himself and the charisma he enjoys despite using the word misplaced more than once. I wished more that I would know about his life in the care home .. about his experience in high school and university..these important milestones passed through to read in some passages exaggerated details, such as that he woke up in the hour such and prayed and ate food..etc. Also, the flow of events was interrupted more than once in a somewhat dispersed manner, such as when he spoke about the presence of the Sheikh who was working for him for his graduation ceremony .. It seemed to me that the beginning of this chapter came late, as the chapter that preceded him reached an advanced stage in the relationship between him and the Sheikh, To return and give the impression that he did not expect the Sheikh to come to the graduation ceremony. In total, I could not give more than two stars to the idea itself ... the rest is an attempt by the writer to polish his image.

I turned the novel to one goal, which is how most of the heroes turn from Judaism To Islam after their fascination with Islam .. I do not have a problem with this idea .. The problem is that the reasons that left them are very weak and not easily change anyone’s religion .. The writer addressed this idea in a very superficial way, and I am not convinced frankly .. who is convinced of him is her fanaticism of Islam only With very weak evidence of their conversion from Judaism to Islam ... the end.

"Without reading any of the writings that this man wrote, or even the writings of Khazbali, may God have mercy on him, Anis Mansour, who is not a true intellectual, but from a cultural claimant, I apologize to the readers, because I will shock them more, as he himself wrote books on ghosts and others, and he transmits other writings from the West and because the complex of Khawaja The Arab and Islamic world hit its African and Asian sides with colonialism, and since Napoleon laminated Egypt with artillery, and the soldiers of the Ottoman Mamluk Empire, the backward, with swords, Arabs, and Muslims, fought against the Khawaja complex, everything that came in the West shines with gold, if someone in the West claimed that he saw God in a dream and said To him, he accepted Islam, they say so and so in the West he holds a degree in physics, he saw God and said to him, Islam accepted, while the uncle of his servant, the seller in the countries of the Arab world, said the same words to accuse him of ignorance and insanity ... The American and the Europeans, perhaps the same reason that called him to stand in the presence of Sadat and the Egyptian peace treaty, are the same ideas that everything that comes from the West is called the gold in the eyes of my eyes and my head and Western civilization is one of the most important civilizations in the universe, but more presented to humanity more than all the eastern civilizations presented in its history Regardless of the phenomenon Colonization and world wars As for western society, there are neither feathers on the head nor the eye, and feathers like the Arab societies and others do not have feathers and invitees, but their chances of education were better, so when they set up, the monument makes sense in the West. There are jugglers and there are swindlers who treat people with fish, laughter, and yoga, the whole world It is considered that writings such as Eric von Dunkin fall within the scope of false science and review through the web the hypothesis of ancient astronauts and you will see that Egyptologists and real history scientists see that such words do not relate to science and not everything that glitters gold reaches sales of writings e A Swiss researcher, as we have admittedly argued that he is a true researcher to a million books annually and wrote more than one book. In fact, the classification of such works as false science or writings falsely or falsely depends on the nature of the science itself, which relies on refutation, not emphasizing material, not on fiction. Therefore, this man&#39;s writings are popular, while for example, we do not expect that the latest writings of physicists will reap the same sales. They are simply like science fiction novels, but they are sophisticated. It is not possible to subject the jinn and ghosts to scientific studies, so all scientists except for the supporters of the false science consider that ghosts and jinn have reasons. Psychological and nervous And some people measured the electromagnetic impulses in some places that everyone claims contain ghosts, then they found that these pulses in these places are very high and that it is the reason that affects people’s minds and because of the spread of popular accounts around a place that has ghostly children or a woman who wears a costume Moein claims many people that they saw the same ghost, then the scholars met by comparing the testimonies of many people who were subjected to these experiments and found that the testimonies, despite their closeness, are not the same as what denies the existence of ghosts, and this is why science is called knowledge on this basis, the idea that I measure on it was Brother / Eric F. And Duncan believed in these metaphysical beings mainly regardless of his evidence in the sixty books. So why does he not try to prove that God sent from the sky angels metaphysics and taught human beings how to build civilizations if we were going to fade in the name of science and say that aliens visited the earth and built civilizations and evidence is these drawings and these stones Etc. What prevents many scholars from believing the existence of God Almighty, knowing that I, praise be to God, is a believer and a Muslim. I am talking about scholars if you deny what you do not see in the name of science. Why do some of you call these perceptions a note, no, masters of science has a different path from religion and spirituality And science is characterized by people Von Duncan must first prove the existence of aliens and work with other research teams to establish the existence of other rational beings other than us in space as well as to be advanced because, for information, many hypotheses about the universe say in a clear way, but there are rational and non-advanced beings and therefore do not communicate With Earth, as for there are basically no sane creatures, there are also living beings. As for there is no life essentially outside the planet Earth, despite the observation of the Hubble Observatory of many planets outside or inside the galaxy, but they are so far away that they cannot be studied closely to make sure they are simply valid. The bottom line is not all What shines in gold Von Duncan began writing his books in the year, during which time he talked about the aliens under the American and Russian space programs and also because of the American flying tests that relied on camouflage through these false novels, but his books did not achieve wide spread until after a movie and series. Stargate Gate of the Stars in the year and although it is an amusing movie but it falls under the broad science fiction item and then after the popularity that these ideas acquired cinematically and in science fiction novels, these proponents of false science began to promote the same hypotheses on a non-scientific basis Gentlemen, he has a well-known style on von Duncan that proves the existence of aliens mainly whether in the planets near us or far away and to obtain clear archaeological evidence from there then for him to claim that they were guests on the ground, how do we accept this insult to us in the recent period what The Egyptians are deprived of their history in the name of the Jews and the servitude of the Children of Israel sometimes and in the name of magic sometimes and now the people of space are sometimes important for the Egyptians to appear ignorant and backward and did not build the pyramids What is this ridiculous .. Why do we not believe the writings of the claimants from the Arab world that the pyramids were built by a people returned and Thamud and why do not we take a long time In absurdity is more art And because he returned and Thamoud mainly from the people of space, no one asked himself who owns the spacecraft how he does not have the video and recording techniques, so he records what he saw on the caves and stones, who owns the spacecraft, how does he not have television, medicine, antibiotics, and everything related to human civilization with a link then scientists begin Pseudo-pseudo-deviation is more in search of a solution to this dilemma and they find nothing more than stupidity in envisioning a catastrophe for which there is no scientific evidence except for one book by Aristotle on a land not related to Egypt and may have sunk signed and toppled all this if that was the case then it makes sense that this catastrophe will topple the life that We know it and it will topple the stone before Els The satellite is soft and it is logical that more than three thousand years of archaeological research and exploration that we will find any technical method and not only a stone that proves that a great civilization preceded the present time ... Whoever searches more will know the responses of the doctor and the distinguished scientist / Zahi Hawas on these peer-to-peer because it is an archaeologist He has a capacity and he can argue with them on the pretext and opinion .. Tariffs in the name of science ... and science is relative, objective, cumulative and material, so what I wrote is literary criticism, not my knowledge, science has other rules that are not known to them and I will add to you prose a line I really hope that there will be an advanced space civilization but The truth is that my regards have not and will not yet exist.

"I can very easily make fun of this book and say that I wasted my time reading it or that its author appeared to be true and that he is not a real writer, and other subjective talk, but I will speak from my personal point of view as someone who has been reading for more than a year. Historical writing has origins and rules, it is never easy to enter a historical era rich in events and decide to write a novel about it, the natural path that most amateurs will take is the direct narration of events and dealing with historical events directly with the addition of side characters that meet in the middle of the novel to reach the peak, but the most difficult It is to make the events of the novel a reflection of what is happening on the ground, that the historical events are merely a snapshot in the background, but its strong influence is evident in the course of the events of the novel, the novel unfortunately took the first course .. I was not optimistic about the good when the author decided to explain at the beginning of his novel some of the historical events He directly feared, and I feared that this was due to his expectation of the quality of his readers who may not know much about this period, but when I reached the end of the novel I found that nothing new was presented on the level of what he presented in his previous works that relied on excitement and surprise, tales that do not rise to the level of the novel The historical, a direct narration of the events and faded backgrounds, figures that have no dimensions or depth, any character in the novel that can completely erase it from the novel and that will not affect the final work, a summons to scenes we saved from the many cinemas presented in films in our home by a man, sunrise, sunset, and series of Ismail Abd Old Hafiz and others, I thought that Hamad Murad to keep him on his audience, who knows him well and give him what is looking for the thrill and exciting, and there are several quick points I would like to conclude by. I do not think it is appropriate for the author to continue to mix between the paschal and the vernacular, to the extent that he decided to write a popular example of al-Qahb with classical. The characters are rushed to take actions that contradict the image he drew, as the coward suddenly turns into a brave and traitor to my homeland. There are some passages in the novel written in a different script, which means that they may be memoirs of the historical figures covered in the novel, and I suspect that he should have mentioned that at the end of the novel.

When I booked this hotel, or it was a mistake for me in my life, you know why, the first person who entered the room was surprised by a room that is less space than the picture of the room that I booked and the strangest thing is that I contacted the receptionist. A room of two beds because we are young and after arguing for ten minutes, he told me he will see that there was a room and after about two hours passed the room was changed but unfortunately the room is wide but the bathroom is very small in addition to something strange happened with me I went out and walked and when the room came back at dawn I tried To open the room door with the card, then A she does not open and my friend came down to the reception so the same Arab employee charged the card and when he came back we tried to open the room and it did not open again and said the employee will come with you to see then when he came he tried to open the door and he did not open and then he took out the mister so that he opened the door and told us are you going out I said to him why I found out that the door was broken and then we went to sleep, and then we left at noon from the hotel.

It does not mean that the writer is a new singer, we are encouraged, we encourage him, we apply it, and we do his concert on the narration with the blinding of our eyes on all the criticism that the writer took in.

The first thing that you get rid of is the first page, you will understand who the murderer is, and after that, it will remain just a faded curiosity, that you understand what killed him, but don&#39;t worry, you will know the motives and the way in the second page along.

"The second reading of Al-Aqqad after Sarah’s account. Akkad as a narration style remains unchanged in this book from Sarah, a method that relies on heavy, discreet sentences and words that you cannot easily digest. For me, it is impossible to finish a book on the contract in two days or days. This is in terms of the style of Akkad, but in terms of what came in the book from the analysis of the attitudes of the Prophet, whether they were political, war, and religious life situations, the contract was according to issues and was unsuccessful in other subjects. Topics related to the establishment of the Prophet and the signs of Mawlid were successful in it and contained new information added to me The issues related to Muhammad&#39;s military genius are always the thorny one. When talking about the Prophet, unfortunately, Akkad was not convincing to me. He relied only on comparisons and moved away from logic. The special chapters on Muhammad, the husband, the father, and the master, the second text of the book according to Akkad, showed the human aspects of the Messenger in a very distinctive way. Perhaps the special part of polygamy was excluded, but otherwise the second half of the book was wonderful and better than its predecessors in stages.

"This book literally made me headaches because of the many confusing and strange information in it that stops the mind and re-read it and try to classify it. I tried to search for some of what was mentioned in the book in the Google search engine, but I did not reach any result remember, let alone match it to what the author mentioned, maybe I did not search correctly or that this information does not exist, or I should be skeptical about it. The book was characterized by exaggeration, and pictures of the space people in the way that American films depict, exactly if there were residents of other planets who may not necessarily be like the image imposed on us .. Then what about the space helmets? If they are more developed and advanced than us, they will have their own technologies that are not necessarily similar to ours, such as helmets, ships, planes and clothes. The book included some pictures of antique drawings that support his words, but it made me confused. For example, I pondered a long time about one of the drawings that the writer says is that of a woman who has a hairstyle and who wears socks and pants. In general, the author reckons his fertile imagination .. For me, everything that I read must pass the balance of the Qur’an and the correct prophetic Sunnah. In the Qur’an there is no mention of rational creatures created by God, but the angels, humans, jinn and the last two are the ones charged with. If we assume that there are inhabitants of other planets, and this possibility may be possible, then it is not a miracle of God, then they will not be but among these three. Unless they have their own messengers and books and we cannot talk about what we do not have knowledge .. Also why is the distant assumption that who came from heaven are aliens, they may be angels, and angels have knowledge that we do not know, as it was stated in the Qur’an that the two angels Harut and Marut have They went down with the people of Babel, teaching them magic to have a temptation, and there are many signs that indicate the descent of the angels and embody them in human beings .. Why is also the other assumption that our human race is unable to develop its own civilizations without the intervention of aliens? Humans who have come to this development in this era are not unique in their kind, and there must be throughout the history geniuses and scientists have come to more than what modern man reached from the sciences, and those sciences have disappeared, including alchemy, alchemy, alchemy and others. Let us take into consideration that the ancients were their longest ages, reaching hundreds of years, and have a long time to learn, develop, teach, and reconstruct the earth, but this is God’s year in his being, nations appear, prevail, degenerate, fall out, and appear. Others do not know much about their predecessors, and so on .. Generally the book makes you think and research a lot.

"A revolutions are not always inclusive, expressive of society as a whole, nor just .. It may be factional, class, or ideological demands, for example what is happening in Thailand now, and its demands are not always fair or reasonable and may be against democracy in some cases by exclusion and intimidation, it is in The end is an expression of the demands of a part of society, and not all of society has less or more in number and proportion in the state. B revolution, in general, is not the only way to change, and there are other ways to change and reform. C revolution may turn into a separate obsession, desire or passion, regardless of the community&#39;s need or reading the reality. D revolution is an ongoing process in the sense of change, not in the sense of demonstrations and clashes. Is it necessary to dismantle the concept of the revolution itself: What do we mean by the term revolution? Is it a people&#39;s uprising against power only ... or is it a broader concept than that on the socio-political level and not on the individual level. Is the officer the number that went out in demonstrations, for example? Or is it the type of claims and the desired change? Or is it geographically expanded to include a greater number of cities and geographical regions? Then the most important question:. What is it based on? What is based on our agreement that the people really came out of a revolution after we defined and defined its conditions? Is every revolution obligatory to meet its demands legally and constitutionally? Or is there a legal and constitutional cover required for the demands of any revolution? New notes: February:. The author is not an academic and only. I remembered from Ressala&#39;s book On the Way to Our Culture that orientalists were studying Muslim societies and presenting the results of their studies to the rulers of the West so that they could direct them to what they wanted. And our author is not far from that. Trying to study the paths of revolutions and model them is nothing but an intelligence effort to guide and transform any revolution in the bud in the bud in the form of what serves American interests. And the twentieth century is full of examples of this ending with the Arab Spring. The second important note. It is the Iranian revolution as a model of a complete revolution opposed to the American interest at the time of its establishment. I had started her study in an analytical study to see how the revolution managed to control the joints of the state, get rid of the old system as a whole, and neutralize or control the army and police and the judiciary quickly. Unfortunately the project was not completed due to the security prosecution. First article link:. : //. . / / .... The third note:. It is the growing role of the media and television channels in general year after year and decade after decade. What Abdel Nasser, Hitler and Mussolini used to say in a sermon inflaming the masses backed by measures on the ground buying the friendliness of the masses such as agrarian reform, for example, or the external threat or the call of ancient Roman nationalism, for example in the case of Mussolini. New leaders have not prepared for all of this. Suffice them with a conspiratorial inflammatory speech focused by the media led by experts of moral guidance through studying the masses and their behaviors. Unfortunately. It appears that the awareness of the masses in general has not developed sufficiently to meet the development of moral guidance methods. They will respond to me, saying that it is the conscious youth and the university students who are leading the opposition to the coup now. I always say young people are the fuel for revolutions. As it happened in January. But they can not manage the helm after overthrowing the system. Or do not have a vision for the post-revolutionary wave. As long as elites and party and community leaders remain captive to old perceptions and ideas. No revolution is completely victorious. I invite you to know what is happening in Thailand and Ukraine now. As examples of failed revolutions in their demands and awareness. In the end, the difference between the true and comprehensive revolution and the factional uprising and narrow popular demands is in seeing this change revolution and the breadth and depth of its demands. What happened in January was an uprising with limited demands. People want to improve conditions. Activists went out against the security crackdown. Islamic currents went out to support the Sharia and enable it to a greater degree. And the revolutions in general that Crenten studied in his book do not fall outside this framework. Most of them were the revolution of the marginalized and oppressed classes against other classes, and thus in the exchange of roles between the classes and some of them. A comprehensive revolution is a revolution that has a clear vision and ideology for reforming conditions in general in the whole world. Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, came up with a revolution from this framework. Islam itself was, is, and will continue to be a revolution against tyranny and slavery when Allah the Exalted, the Majestic. The last and most important note in my opinion was considered the will of a war-weary combatant. The conflict is global and so to speak. Not with Sisi, with a military council, or with kings here and there. This does not mean adopting the option of carrying weapons, for example, on the Al Qaeda method. But. Our knowledge of the depth, breadth and coverage of the problem. It makes us better able to guide it and awareness of its dimensions. How many aborted projects because of the lack of awareness, and the most prominent example that brings me to mind is that Morsi came to Sisi himself, so there is no explanation for me except the lack of awareness .. And in the past the Brotherhood came to Abdel Nasser as well. The revolution must be directed against the real enemy. Awareness first, then to stop cognitive bleeding and mental and intellectual distortion, which they are leading a craft and perform. Then, by adopting the opposite action, let us get out of the circle of reaction and aborted dreams. I borrow this paragraph from an article I recently read for a Syrian writer named Ahmed Daadouch:. Finally, we realize that evading the global Protestant Jewish conspiracy will only take place with a counter plot that possesses the same ingredients, and is woven with the same savvy, and looks at the conflict from a perspective that expands to the whole world and extends for centuries to come, and is based on the intentions of Shari&#39;a gradually when necessary, and realizes that the declaration of a Sunni Islamic state in Any country on the ground today will push the Arabs and the West to fail it before it ripens ...

"I found it on Smart TV von a young man talking about the literature of Naguib Mahfouz in the film Naguib prepared by the Al-Jazeera Documentary Channel and it included critics, historians and personal friends of Mahfouz himself, so I remembered that I left a story series called the ghost of Anton Chekhov on the body shelf. At first glance, the title suggests a great effect that you might get, so I went to the fact that the ghost here is the spirit of Chekhov and its impact on the author and I started in a whirl of imagination, so I thought that the group has a distinctive literary nectar that will not cause the reader to lift his head off the lines but with the beginning of reading attack yawning then immortalize To sleep, contented by the average per capita consumption of boredom and the amount you got in your very ordinary day. The writer dedicates the work to his most famous friends, and divides his friends into my birth month: January, February, March etc., and a final story bearing the title of the group. But at the level of the event, we can divide it into: the unity of the family’s love, weakness and the might of pity, raving, the memory of the divorce, the nightmare of the past, and the female rebellion. We can also put a common slogan on the group&#39;s general theme: delirium. The writer is fluent in the use of Arabic, and this is a condition that must be met by any writer, but it is not the only condition. When reviewing in the December story, the page attributes he preserves that can describe the main character of prostitutes from dawn, promiscuity, and submission to the last dictionary that he listed without any need or justification fear For her hero to turn to those models, all of those attributes are listed in three pages are the same three pages that Chekhov wrote his important story, the fat and thin without any review or transfer of entire pages of attributes. But if we came to our last stop, we should look at the last story differently from all of the above. In the story of the obese and the skinny, which the author notes that she wrote opposing the obese and thin story that started at the Nikolai railway station, the main idea of Chekhov in writing it was the human nature, which Through it, and on three pages, pictures of what the rank and wealth do in two friends who were once one thing. We can know the value of the literary opposition through the poem Naguib Surur, which he started with you, those standing on the edge of the morgue, opposing the poem Amal Dongel, which he started with, you who stand on the edge of the massacre.

And story plot. And I doubt that the problem is in the style of Paulo Coelho himself, otherwise he would not have gained such wide popularity. I hope I can choose a better writer next time

The professor proposes an idea that obscures his daughter, who is less than fifteen, and who confirms that she is a child to take a decision like this, except that he is proud and joyful that she made this step ... I mean, a contradiction on the one hand who wants the veil to be her personal decision, on the one hand he says that it must be affected With the debt that we raised on him, and he says that she is a child who is not yet empowered to know things, so she must follow the Sunnahs of her mother and her sister who are veiled in advance ... why the woman and not the man. Here, the professor is trying to convince the girls why they are wearing the veil, is not this injustice for them .. but because he does not find anything suitable to convince us with it ... he says it simply: it is how you like it you like it you don&#39;t like it it is like this and it is necessary for this and salvation .. ok ok this is the argument ??

"How to spoil a wonderful movie for everyone in the late nineties and early years of the new millennium, the British group produced an unprecedented documentary series on life on the planet in prehistoric times, which brought about a completely new breakthrough in the field of documentary films that followed dozens of films and episodes Documentary after that. The series was great and revolutionary in everything .. production, thought, vision, and computer influences .. And it bore a major title:, followed by more than one description according to the historical era .. that dealt with the story of life before the age of dinosaurs, followed by B, then, and finally This is the exact historical arrangement of the series, not the release date. The most important and most successful parts of the era were the dinosaurs, especially since it appeared in the era known to those interested in the field of fossils as the awakening of the second dinosaurs, which was initiated by a group of modern scientific discoveries that turned our attention completely towards these wonderful creatures. The new animation movie shares the L series in the name, production and subject matter, but it differs artistically in everything from what was presented brilliantly in the past. With Hollywood as a 20th century Fox Studio enters as a major production partner, the whole business has gone completely wrong. In the original series we watched a fascinating display of the daily life of dinosaurs, from their debut timidly more than a million years ago, through their full domination of the Jurassic era, and ending with their great extinction in the Cretaceous period a million years ago. All this with an informed, educated, and informative voice commentary, uniquely blending science and art and imagination. Everyone was waiting for the new movie to go in the same way, but it might take it to broader horizons and horrific stages .. Especially with the development of technology it has become possible to provide dinosaurs as we have not seen them before .. In the film, we follow the huge annual migration of a flock of th Bakirinosaura, a herbaceous dinosaur with a long skull spanning four prehistoric northern regions of Canada. The scenario was destined to show the events in the style of Al, that is, a documentary film in a narrative cinematic form .. We were supposed to watch this natural epic with a sober documentary befitting it. This is before the producers finally change their minds and take the movie in a completely different direction that will remind you of the ridiculous cartoon movies we see on TV, especially those aimed at children as young as years. Fox of the twentieth century, producer of the film in the last stages of production, changed its plan from a discreet documentary with a fictional character, to a family movie directed mainly at children, and for this made all the animals in the film speak .. and the result was: complete failure. A hybrid movie that you cannot enjoy its seriousness, nor are you able to indulge in its humor, especially with provocative sounds .. Instead of seeing dinosaurs interacting with each other through roaring, snarling, bellows, and loudness ... we were forced to listen to disturbing conversations that did not stop For one moment throughout the events .. Add to this that the animals&#39; mouths never move, just listen to their thoughts. A group of young Hollywood actors was chosen with voices without distinction and does not offer any pleasure Justin Long in the lead role. The dialogue itself was written in a very disturbing way ... with a very contemporary American joke and ... which will make you wonder: Is this what is going on in the minds of prehistoric dinosaurs? It is the most ridiculous thing that you can see at all .. And to torture further, the filmmakers did not make their dialogue stop for a second to breathe or ease the viewer&#39;s mind, but it continued to be sticky, silly, and annoying throughout the events of the film even in the most dramatic moments ... which It will make you ascetic in the first third hour, and you will try hard to dampen the sounds in your head in any way and enjoy the image only, but without any success in reality. Now what about the soundtrack accompanying the events? Which is supposed in a movie that shows one of the most important major migrations that took place in history to be epic, or at the very least poetic, that puts you in the air that does not take you away from it .. but hey .. here you will listen to a group of the most ridiculous contemporary American songs that vary between Rock, pop, and hip-hop .. and let the air go to hell .. let&#39;s spoil this to everyone in every possible way. One thing you&#39;ll enjoy in the movie is the stereoscopic show ... the one that came out very solid, and very cool. Other than this, you will come out of the theater with a strong headache, and the remnants of annoying voices that never stop gossip inside your head .. The movie met a huge failure in theaters, especially with fierce competition with other animation films that provided real art as your example, where he has achieved so far within America million Only dollars. All in all, I took Hollywood Fantastic Th that everyone loved and turned it into something very ridiculous and vulgar, this is a movie that will not love more children in dinosaurs, but may make them wander with love and feel the absurdity of their unique hobby. Special advice: Don&#39;t go for a walk with the dinosaurs in the theater .. And if you want to see another wonderful movie about dinosaurs going on in the same place as prehistoric Alaska, and deals with the same types of dinosaurs, but with a great deal of greatness and splendor, I recommend you the amazing documentary. Or you can wait a little while the movie&#39;s Blu-ray is released, a version of it will be available without those ridiculous sounds, and also with accompanying different soundtracks .. Only then, you will be able to enjoy your dinosaurs dearly as it should, if you are obsessed with it like me.

And every time they fall one after the other as if I read that novel The brilliant darkness .. I thought the end would be joyful .. full of feelings of joy and madness, but he stamped it with a slap, it really came back and came back, but without showing the momentum of the great feelings that occur when meeting loved ones after a separation that lasted a year. Generally, this is what concerns the story ... The character of Hanna Yaacoub was devastating and does not inspire optimism and pain. He was passive and does not inspire life for you. I think that he was very fortunate in his success only. Did you not see him not mentioned with the Druze of Belgrade? The other characters overwhelmed him so much that you wonder where are we?

In fact, he excelled in describing places, homes, cities, and food as well, as was the pilgrimage journey that was beautiful .. There is wonderful historical political information .. I believe that if he made this trip in a format other than sadness and prison literature it would have been more worthy, and because of the prison literature we have seen him move from tragedy to prison To a castle with the same feelings .. a boring repetition ..

"The strangest thing to find on the page of this novel is the conflicting reviews in a striking way between Mahqr and most of this work, which, if anything, indicates that the opinions are affected by each other. I see that it is a work well below the average, as you do not come out of the novel with nothing but the irony of the superficiality of the hepta itself.

"I admit that the novel attracted me even that I read it in one session and it amounts to more than four hundred pages, but I have some notes on it: I did not like the political direction throughout the lines of the novel. The writer insists on polishing Marxism through several pivotal figures in the life of the heroine of the story, such as the slave of the prison fellow, for example. Mr president . The stories and pornography are redundant, and the author described parts of the women’s bodies that are repeated many times ... the portent of Marwa, the husband of the minority son of the minority, and the army officer who refused orders to raise the boy&#39;s childhood companion to attack the prison of Palmyra, an interchangeable figure of the story costing and banishing every Syrian who knows how to purify and liquidate officers The army that is used to plunge into dangerous battles, to win over the rogue sect in this naive way will not do anything, I think that if the writer had been able to write the story in these days, I would reconsider this character ... digression or inherited my extreme boredom, writer digression plus and I noticed that he speaks About side stories almost ten Sik the main story in what I imagined was an increase in the pages of the novel, no more. Companionship in prison affected the heroine to a point that made her turn a degree in her thoughts and beliefs, so she left the prayer in prison and left it without a veil and no longer cares about him, just as she became drinking alcohol, all this effect is irrational to make her endure in prison all this time, because whoever believes in his ideas He is fiercely defended by whoever is able to remain in prison, whatever his orientation, while giving up ideas so easily it foretells of a defeated character who cannot continue to live life ... from racism and ridiculous stereotypes that Islamist women are portrayed with the image of the neglected woman for herself and her beauty, As the heroine was not caring for herself And for her appearance when she was in the group and after her release from prison she became concerned with her elegance and body. Another digression that I did not see any reason for is the story of the Afghan-Soviet war, which was reflected in the story on the character of Safa and her husband Abdullah ... It seems that the writer owns a good ignorance of Islamic movements when he writes that the heroine of the story owns books by Ibn Baz that she considered references to her knowing that she belongs The organization of the Muslim Brotherhood and the two groups have great differences.

The writer followed his writing on the British astronomer Michael Hart&#39;s approach to the book of one hundred most influential characters, which he started by classifying the Prophet of the Nation of Islam, Mustafa Muhammad, peace be upon him, at the top of the list, where the latter tried to collect a figure throughout the ages and times that contributed to crystallizing the world today. And here came the idea of jihad, with only Islamic figures .. I do not hide from you that the book as an idea is a good gesture to introduce young people to Islamic personalities who have rarely heard about them, but there are some notes that raised me positive and negative as well ...

Restricting to the fighting and political personalities in most of the book&#39;s places and not mentioning one living science scientist, astronomy physics ..... or human sciences philosophy of sociology .... and the Islamic nation does not lack this kind of personalities especially in the golden period of Islam .. Errors Spelling that invaded the book in a strange way .. Thinness in style and repetition, not to mention the use of words that are not worthy of a history book such as: The infidel heretic ....

Unfortunately, I thought, the book deserves to be placed next to the children&#39;s family and reading to them whenever the opportunity arises, but taking into consideration correcting spelling errors and deleting other phrases Decency, insult, and slander in personalities, and if they are incompatible with our ideology, then all of his mind thinks about him, and no writer has the right, regardless of the way, to use excesses and exaggerate his religion or doctrine on any other party.

"Actually, though, Hoda&#39;s review is very harsh, but regardless of this, she agreed with her in very many points. I do not need to repeat it. It is assumed that the novel is interesting, but I could hardly touch it except in a few points. Up to a quarter of the novel, it was assumed, for example, that Professor Naeem died in suicide, and the presumption of murder was not originally destroyed, except for two dimensions, even though from the first it was very clear psychologically that even it was impossible that he would have committed suicide. The novel ends with a surprise, and it contains something of decoding that I did not like. What does it mean that the numbers in the letter are numbers for Surat Al-Baqara, the second verse? What is the goal and what is the important detail in this? Many needs of the novel. And if I have a conviction rate with an idea that the writer wanted to clarify in general that the Jews control is by infiltrating the centers of power and penetrating them into sensitive positions so that they mainly control events, which justifies the Jewish lobby, for example, and the control of a terrible number of American Jews over the press, the media, and the centers of money and power ..

But .. I often felt very superficial, and very naive, while reading it. In her depiction of the suffering of the woman, the basic work corner was unsuccessful, and Dad ran away from Haifa to Jerusalem at Lisa, whom she had met once or twice and attends the women&#39;s demonstration, then simply and easily returns to her family .. Thus the social aspect in general was extremely naive and superficial. As for her portrayal of the revolution and the sheikh, it was totally unfair and abusive, even though it could have reduced its value and size in a more logical way.

"I couldn&#39;t comment on the whole book just to name a few. What I liked about the book is its idea and it accepts the writer to search for the truth and research in other religions and not accepting the idea of this is what our father found us .. some weaknesses. The first thing in the book started to liken some religions placed in the Islamic religion and the convergence of their ideas and likeness of the Greek gods to the angels, which makes Islam the object of doubt to those who ask him himself .. Another point is that the writer was blaming the atheists by attacking the religious and describing them as naive while the writer does not find any embarrassment by describing the atheists as arrogance and foolishness and foolishness and imitating them with animals That you don&#39;t agree with. The writer&#39;s view of scientific theories is not that of a researcher for four years. Rather, he was repeating what the common people repeat about the Big Bang and development. He finds that evolution is apes transformed into a human being. Many believers believe in the accuracy of these scientific theories because they basically do not contradict the existence of the Creator. They only explain how things happen without reference to the existence of a Creator or not .. At first, the writer rejects the theory of the Big Bang and then inferred from the Qur&#39;an on the validity of this theory? Have they not seen those who disbelieve that the heavens and the earth were slavery, and we have separated them? In a number of chapters, the author has interpreted the Qur’an according to the likes of most interpretations he wrote, for which no source has been written. I do not think that the Qur’an is a literary or scientific book in which you search for and interpret the facts according to what befits you or what you find appropriate for Islam to defend. Some verses, such as the creation of the fetus, have a scholarly dispute over it, and placing it as a miracle without clarifying the scholarly dispute that may offend religion more than it raises it. Another point concerning science and religion is that some scientific hypotheses invalidate over time. Science is in constant development and modernization. Does this make the Qur’an questionable? Or, it is insulting in religion when some people decide to link the Qur’an to the scientific miracles .. Even at the end of the book, the writer clarifies some verses and links them and their interpretation to the liking of the reader so that he did not agree with them that the Qur’an mentioned faith in the constellations. This is the conclusion of modifying texts for personal purposes. In another chapter, the author regrets the situation of women in Europe during the dark ages, and I would like to see him describe the condition of women in the current Islamic era. And put this point as if it defects Christianity. If his measure of religion is with the hardening that is taking place, then it is more important to consider that ISIS represents the true Islam. What you refuse to your religion do not blame the debt of others. Likewise, Christian militants treated women deservingly, and the extremists of Islam treated them similarly. The writer believes that underdevelopment in Europe at the time was due to religious beliefs and churches. Does he now likewise believe that the cause of underdevelopment in the Middle East is religious beliefs and mosques? The writer also mentioned that the woman’s physical desire outweighs the man and he did not mention any scientific source that proves it. If this information is correct, it will cancel one of the main reasons for legalizing marriage by four, which is to protect the man from engaging in forbidden relationships. As a matter of first, it is permissible to marry four women. In conclusion, the book was different from the best-selling books of these years. I think it deserves an opportunity to read it even if it is not accurate in its content or is broad in other sciences.

"The beautiful language of the author could not heal the strangeness that surrounds the style on every side .. The book is a collection of letters from a girl to a friend, but the writing style makes you return to making sure that the writer is young and I mistook it as a girl at the beginning .. There are very beautiful analogies, but I I felt a bit of a monotony and repetition after the first five texts.

"The novel is entertaining and exciting. I gave her two stars for several reasons: How to comment the reader at a climax and quickly move to another character for several pages. Frankly, the style of Oban makes me think of Arabic series, minus ads in the text .. fishy interest in the details of porn in his field. Using the symbol and projecting the conditions of the country in a very superficial way that does not call for any thinking, as there was no deficiency, except that it degrades the explanation at the bottom of the page. Nevertheless, I was very tired of her villages, and I wanted to save her.

"Receptionist is very very bad. Breakfast needs more types. The employee at the reception is very very bad. He calls the hour at dawn. He wants to pay the bill for the bar. He sent a person to the room at the same time. He was very, very, very annoying. I could not sleep until the morning. Knowing we were not in the bar and in the morning we spoke to the receptionist. He said it was a mistake and we apologize. We were exhausted into the morning and could not go to work, who is responsible for the loss of a working day

"Everything is beautiful, but I did not entrust Windham to other countries, such as Windham, Dubai. I expected Dubai to be the best. Positions.

"A play that fell short of me. Tawfiq Al-Hakim is a well-known play, and there is no dust, and I loved his other works, but this play did not move about anything. The writer used smooth and fluent language, but the story was between push and pull, until the play ended in poor meaning. A cliched ending that makes each one of us the same.

"I am still asking myself to the extent that I read it, why? . You may attract me in the first when I knew that the heroine of the story is dumb and that he loves her and wants to marry her. It can be imagined at the time that he would stand his mother’s economy and convince her of his love for his dumb cousin. And convince her that the fact that she is dumb, he will not be hindered by anything that she is a wife and a mother. However, the exact opposite happened, and Hattan surrendered from his first tour with his mother. Also, I do not know, or are I unable to imagine how Muslim people would analyze themselves forbidden? Do these things have nothing to do with Islam? It is possible that I liked only the novel Haneen, despite her handicap, not that she was strong and did not sit with her hand on her cheek, waiting for the return of Hattan to her. But with the first opportunity for her to marry, she got married and left him as he left her. In short, the novel spoke more about the love of the body than the love of the soul and has a disgusting need. Very good:",Negative,Negative
