They did not condemn him to death, but by staying alive, he got the spit of the mob and the palm of them. Death on him is easier than trampling on his honor ..... honor ..... the man’s crown and his glory .... if he goes, there is no manhood or men .. from the beautiful lines .... we are now at war with a mighty and compelling enemy We take revenge on him for his injustice, his injustice, his weakness, and his elongation on us with his strength and abundance, so it is worthy of us not to do what we revere from him and take him with, so that God may have mercy on us and look at us with an eye of justice and charity and equals our weakness Of his strength, and we said of his abundance ..

Away from the historical mistake in the novel, it is Tariq ibn Ziyad who burned the ships because he was not a guardian. Because he is the unfortunate pasha, he does not review himself every time. I don’t know how, in one of the first authors for the youngest one in the publishing house, I would like to hear that this book is originally described. Despite all the warnings that people wrote here, I only said people recently, and I am unjust to them, Nabil Farouk Kawi. So I said scabby can be in a different need. But the truth is that it is a book that is very much less than any other village it needs before. At first, I used to say that it is the last of which a number of cocktails are worked out for us. But after I concluded it, especially the silly end of it. This story does not deserve to be printed on paper. My only consolation is that I have a PDF and muddish village in it. I don&#39;t know, I used to give myself a way to pay EGP two years when I went to the book fair. I know that the review is not pure literary criticism and it is a personal opinion. But the novel does not even smell literature even. Reducing the novel tells the story of the amulet through the ages. In the end, the whole story tells the story of Atlantis, which is Nabil Farouk, so our brain closed it in every preparation of a cocktail.

Why did it not impress me? the work ?? Why did I give him two stars of origin because he simply touched the absurdity as Ghassan touched it, but I did not hear from her aura because the latter when he wanted to build the philosophy of non-life, inability and fateful mysticism absent from his mind the intelligence / analytical line of the story, jumped from the temple to reach the meaning, and this It was a bitter and unforgivable mistake. To adopt a philosophical / intellectual story, you must first sew the garment in wide sizes so that the reader does not catch you from distress and confuses you in questions that you yourself ignored .. We have a legal issue that was the structure, but to reach the meaning it was necessary To avoid the pitfalls of judicial and defensive construction lawyers so that we receive what he kneaded Ghassan Na and I was the face of this disgraceful Hedda work ..

However, it lacks principles and values. It is not a condition of work in which there are expressions or suggestions, in order for them to be poor. It is also possible that he is missing principles and values and ethics, and his hour of his will will be bad.

Why do you feel inferior, as if you were saying: Islam is ours, you are the birth of a dog. You say to the people: My religion is the correct one, enter in it and God will burn you. Who is the one that people understand, that our Lord is concerned that someone enters into the Islamic religion or not? Why do I feel we are supposed to demonstrate the Islamic religion? We are wandering in order to attract the largest number of les, and entice them to say and invite? Why do you want the religious people to turn into sales representatives ... they would give each other a little bit and say: Enter the debt in our merchants, and give it away. Why are we supposed to stand up and say to them: Religion, this brings a number of features and fascination? The first need: that you would fear heaven if you believed in it ... and not just that, because you can also invite people to it ... no man? I am like astonished. If it was up to me ... you would be the first one and those like you to be charged with contempt of religions. .......... Sheikh Mansah says:. They only know of the rights of women except the right of displaying, removing the headscarf, the right to travel without a mahram, the right to drive a car, the right to work and to mix with men ... and they call these stupid rights. What do you think of women&#39;s rights? You remain the obedient master and she is happy to obey you de ... and she is a queen because she belongs to you ... the queen is the one who is waiting for her obedient master to make her legs collapse in water and salt ... she disappears from before all people except he ... is this kingdom for you? Oh God ... you are sure that our Lord created the harem for that? It means one that remains deprived of car exercise, travel with prohibited blood, from work, from choosing to demolish it by itself, and from contact with people. Is this still a queen? What if you were going to do what? Then what do you export ... that your anti-invisibility is that one goes to a dance? Its contents say: they want her to become a dancer, people enjoy seeing her body and her charms ... I mean, she has a woman, you either obedient to the husband, veiled in the house and wearing a black tent ... oh either you work as a dance or prostitute? What a stupid thought? ......................... The songs say Rakia Al-Zina ... Are you sure? So if we forbid adultery, would it mean meaning? I am sure that you are the one who lacks music. Aref you: If I heard only a cut off for Beethoven, not Bach, not even for Omar Khairat, no thunder behind, or for Omar Farouk ... By God, you will remain like the full ... fornication, but who is the pilgrim? You look like you by nightmares nightmares, so keep reading Al-Muathtaan and let the six mother boil you a little Tlio, or guava paper and you remain like the ful. With my great respect to you.

The toilet was in need of repair, which is what we had hoped for from the staff there, but no one came to fix it. Finally the breakfast buffet was an insult to tourists / backpackers. In fact it was stupid to stay at that hotel, so we decided to leave the hotel the next morning to come after we had breakfast. And before we carry our bags and leave for another hotel we went for ten minutes to spend some money from the cash machine, and when we returned to the hotel we discovered that the hotel staff had stolen the money from our bags about a euro stolen after we calmed down a little bit we went to the reception to pay the bill and leave, and we asked them where we can find Police station to report the hotel. But they made matters worse when they refused to tell us the location of the police station. But of course we did find the police station, and we filed the complaint.

When I fell in my hands and Sherine&#39;s reputation, I had a good necrophilia, expected by a more mature and bold novel, with a relatively large number of pages that exceeds necrophilia. The result was just the opposite. Truthfully I never enjoyed it ... satiated by the theories of the global conspiracy in which Dan Brown put the last word and anyone who tries to write in it again will never add new and it has been. The author herself indicated among the events that she resembles the events of Dan Brown&#39;s novels by the heroine. The rhythm is very slow, and the events do not move until late after the boredom has possessed me, so I push myself to complete it without stealing my eyes and pushing me to devour the event as its previous version. Sherine advised me. The first: You have a really good narrative talent so I hope you will be very patient before any work and there is no need to rush and come up with an idea that does not offer, does not delay, does not help you, and does not benefit me as a reader. Take your time until you return to a topic and plot that only you can do ... just like everyone shocked you in the first novel. Second: I hope to provoke your literary abilities in something new, away from psychological horror. Do not limit yourself to only one branch. Sorry if I had disappointed you ...

Positive,two put two star suspense active novel able finish day two opinion strength star writer narration research investigation clear necessary novel colloquialism exaggerated manner love country real atmosphere novel feel really hollow people blue elephant teenage novel many imagine sentence novel victory phone novel short list author pure police novel wanted make power flowery information death degree enough salvation first page praise else writer information language reader stand act writer higher reader writing narcissistic new language nothing language novel return basic point narration police linguistic philosophical reader psychiatrist know medical novel novel explanatory notes decreased five think satisfied amount novel light,Negative,"One or two stars ??. I will put two stars ... a star: Because the suspense factor was active in this novel, as you will be able to finish it in a day or two .. This is, in my opinion, a factor that has some strength .. Another star: because the writer worked on his narration with research and investigation and this was clear more than Perhaps necessary. Now we come to the novel&#39;s weaknesses: First: The novel was overflowing with colloquialism in an exaggerated manner. I love the novels that take you in the ordinaryness of the country until it enters into the real atmosphere. Like the novel Al-Madhoun and Madame from Tel Aviv. You feel really in the hollow of Gaza between the people and the Palestinians. But here with this blue elephant. It was like a teenage novel that many words were written in English. Can you imagine such a sentence in a poker-nominated novel? . Taki ... but this is a victory ... and. . Originally, Maya was answering from him. . He is in Maadi .... Wait, I have my phone. . . Yes, it is a novel that reached the short list in Poker. Second, it appears to me that the author here was not convinced that this was a pure police novel. So he wanted to make it a power of legends, flowery words, and psycho-medical information. Love, isthmus, and death .... up to a degree that is not enough for salvation, and I arrived after the first page, praise be to God. Third: Am I the only one who felt this, or was there anyone else. He felt that the writer was practicing the muscles of his information and language, if you will, to the reader. For me, I cannot stand this act. The writer who sees himself higher than his reader, his writing becomes narcissistic. It came with new language styles and phrases, but it added nothing to the language, not even to the novel. We return to our basic point that this narration is destined to be police, not linguistic, philosophical. Also, the reader is not required to be a psychiatrist to know the meanings of the medical terms included in the novel. It would not detract from the novel that the explanatory notes were added to the aforementioned types of diseases. Although I am against mixing English with Arabic. Three stars decreased out of five ... I think I will be satisfied with this amount. The novel is light, had it not been for the preoccupations that I mentioned before

The last scenes, when Christ fell and participated mysteriously in the killing of these monks, then the appearance of comforter in the form of a lover answering the hero&#39;s existential questions in a few lines confirms to you that the writer could not answer these existential questions about death, especially after reducing all the scenes and feelings of love in sexual scenes Just as if this is the only sign of life ... the metaphysics at the end of the novel with those absurd scenes of Christ and the Comforter was a tragedy ending your reading of that novel

And what is now reading? And what will he read next? That question stems from my firm belief that a good writer is also a good reader. Many writers have spoken a lot about this, and they have important and inspiring articles. But the deepest and most important of them was Borges when he said simply: I do not like to sit with a book writer more than he read .. Perhaps this is a matter of good reason. If the quality of the books he read improves, then his writing improves. Or at least the books gave him new ideas, or maybe he improved his style, performance, wording and language. Many novelists around the world wrote about things that killed writing, but their formulation, and the angle they saw the story made them offer excellent books .. Anyone has the right to write whatever he wants, that freedom that allows everyone to do whatever they want. In the end, this is in our interest as readers. The presence of all shades and colors fills us with joy and happiness. But insisting on celebrating one type of literature, songs, and films reveals how bad the taste has reached .. In the same sense, you have the right to write a script, but do not write on the cover that it is a narrator, as happened here. The novel is written as if it is a movie script, but even this scenario has many shortcomings .. As for the title, there was no embarrassment and the title is just a simple problematic issue regarding what fills the novel from mistakes. The writer said that Hebta means number seven in the Greek language. First there is no longer what is called the Greek language, it means the Greek language. Secondly, the number is pronounced Epta in a thousand, not a distraction. Third, after reading the novel, I wonder about the relationship of the title to the content. The title of the novel is just like this. The reader must discover that it is seven stages of love. What is the relationship of Greek love and its stages? Why the Greek language in particular? I do not know. But the only answer is to preserve the requirements of marketing and advertising. An attractive and strange title must be chosen .. In the end, I say that these famous bad books have a terrible negative effect on the talented writers as a real talent. It makes them feel that everything that they write, read and do has no value in all of this. Perhaps they stopped writing because of despair. That is why I say to all talented novelists, who have not yet had the opportunity to appear and spread, that you do not underestimate and not be sad. I know that when you watch what is going on, you may get frustrated. Low-value books with valuable content are at the forefront, people read them and many talk about them and eventually turn into movies. I tell you, dear, I hope this will not make you sad. I hope you won&#39;t stop writing just because you can&#39;t keep up with the prevailing general climate that encourages bad and bad. I tell you that people&#39;s tastes change, as everything changes. This general climate will change for the better after a while, it is only a matter of time .. You should know that in the nearly forties there was a novelist named Ismail Wali Al-Din filling the world and working people, and his novels turned into movies. Naguib Mahfouz did not know then a few. Now what is left of Ismail Wali Al-Din? Several bad commercial movies? And where did he write? Is anyone reading to him now? Please, talented and talented, don&#39;t stop writing. Just write

I am always wary of many books that meet a great boom and echo, and this is based on many books I read because of the uproar around them, then I discover that they do not deserve all of this in my view. We say this is my personal opinion. But I allow myself to give the opportunity to such books, so perhaps they deserve all that and more, and some books have proven as well ... But I have noticed that the majority of these books harvest this noise from the general readership because they touch something inside a person, touch his feelings or suffering and start to manipulate the feeling On the surface, one of us would like it, but if many of them were subjected to a fair evaluation, why would these works not be huge? This book I see is a book closer to the commercial, which tickles the religious senses of others and presents a utopian image of a person’s relationship with his Lord, and completely ignores a person’s relationship with his community .. I can say With a mouthful of narration that narrates the horizon narrow, and the judgments that it claims Miqa, it is essentially superficial and contradictory ... The writer drops the story of the miserable wife Ella who lost much of her soul after a exhausted life of caring for a husband and caring for the children and then met her dear when she decided to search for work on the love story that Rumi and Tabrizi fought in her words ... the narration The novelist and the syntax are excellent, the style is smooth and enjoyable and very fit when you lose fitness in reading. Hold this book until it paves you back to reading again ... I am not skilled in literary criticism, but I will write my abstract opinion:. The work is not that strong enough to fuss this noise .. It frankly misses a lot .. A very consuming and boring idea .. It does not arouse any enthusiasm for me .. The only good thing is to link the past to the present and this leads us to criticize the historical aspect that I see very weak in this novel. There is no strong historical history or observation of that period, the novelist could leapfrog the novel to higher levels by supporting the historical side in a deeper way than the surface in which it was taken up ... And whoever recites Azazel and the Granada trilogy or the narrator of Cordoba will fully realize the weakness of its historical side ... One of the advantages of fictional work for me is that no one conquers his idea, unlike books Intellectual or objective .. dialogues and you can choose what suits you and each in his opinion right and wrong, but this novel felt that the victory of the idea of mysticism is very present .. it always highlights that the last word of the sun and his thoughts. The ideas of others are presented in a way that appears wrong and superficial. There is a lot of exaggeration in that ... So I say that the horizon of the novel is very narrow .. and contradictory .. People are two classes: a hard-liner who loves pleasure or worship governs by appearance ... Tabrezi&#39;s category: love and love and outside is excluded even if you drink wine ... a childish and naive idea, not From Sufism in something .. It promotes that Islam is just that way, as depicted by Shams who is in the novel, and besides that they are ignorant and lost much of Islam .. This is a kind of madness and contradiction and I only show you what I see ... It is not reasonable to ask others That they do not make judgments regarding our actions and that this is only between us and God, but man is present in a society and his actions most of which affect this community A Pei or willing .. The Quran came with individual, community, political, military, and family organizations. You cannot separate yourself from society. Then you say, I will drink a glass of wine and I will practice sweet disbelief and then promote it as the ideal Islam. Yes, I strongly believe that there are behaviors that we have nothing to do with it, as it is between the servant and his Lord, as long as it does not affect society or my freedom as an individual .. But the flattening of the idea in this narration is the one that I reject ... Therefore, I say that the horizon of the novel is narrow and does not present the pure image of Sufism Rather, Sufism presents its most naive form ... The truth is that after reading it for a long time, I slowly began to hate: What does this narration want? What do I need to deliver? None of what was mentioned in the introduction to the book did not convince me that there is none of that which profoundly communicated or presented .. no love, no love, no worship ... unjustified reverence for the relationship of Shams and Rumi is strange? There is contempt for the rest of humanity in an indirect and perhaps unintended way .. The sun and those like it are the mystics in this narration who were able to reach very high levels of spirituality that would not be understood by the simple people who look to Islam without what is seen by those who dance and rotate and then their souls are united at levels Etc. etc. Then there are many nodal fallacies that I cannot yet pass safely ... What does it mean if the adopted child in Rumi House watches you see dead souls and talks to them as if they have. On other worlds ... Then there are a good number of transgressions that have no origin but flaws ... As for the forty rules of love itself, the rule of rule is not new or an invention from the writer, but I can say that the writer failed to include the rules in the template of the novel .. The topic turned into a lecture and indoctrination .. as if they were numbered paragraphs to be included .. In the sentences, the inclusion of the rules was very, very weak and not appropriate for the fictional work. Therefore, I say work is a novelist that is not good at all and does not deserve that commotion, but it caresses our feelings through religious thoughts that contain many fallacies so that we assume that we really agree with everything and that we are tired of the intervention of others and their narrow view of our relationship with our Lord while we are part of all the characters in the novel ... ... we judge, narrow and expand worship, how we want and then we read a book that simulates emotion only so we tend to it and believe that we are always the victim ... the book is a weak summary of those who will read it with a mind and heart, and will discover from the first quarter the shallowness of the historical and eclectic aspect in it. I do not advise you to read it without reading Sufism from several references and without reading about Al-Roumi and the history of that period ... In the end, in the book are good things that we take and return the rest ..

But this feature turned into a flaw for the many characters, which caused me a lot of distraction. Add to that the abundance of his speech on the political side in Kuwait, which I do not understand, which compelled me to skip those lines in order to return to the heart of the novel, and it did not lose me a lot of pleasure. I enjoyed the first third of the novel, got bored in the second third, and got distracted in the last third, telling a story by one of his heroes and then denying it by the same hero to tell another different story for the same incident by the same narrator. The novel is full of unfortunate events and unfortunate people. I do not like this type of narration, because life has a lot of negative energies, so I do not have to read more.

Four main models in the novel: the female characters in the novel enjoy strength compared to the male characters in which submission, submission, clear surrender, crushing under the weight of external societal, political, and introverted circumstances and the inability to make decisions are feast .. Eid and Sylvia The love between a Muslim and a Christian who is met with refusal to resort to satisfying him despite all Something in spite of the nose of the family, society and religion .. And Mary and the dreamer writer who is vocal about everything, even God, is an example of love that he fears .. neither does he want to preserve him nor does he want to break from him .. He is a model for the person who fears for his love so much of everything and decides not to commit Towards him To me at all, even if he is full as a thief or as a bat, afraid of darkness being exposed by him .. Mary is the opposite of the writer .. realistic .. wise .. crazy .. sad and angry sometimes and happy sometimes .. Eid in the opposite of the writer tried in every way to take a legitimate path For his love, even if he abandoned his religion, the sub-characters in the novel were truncated, incomplete at all, as if they were used as a filling for the events of the scarce novel and a contribution to speeding up its monotony ... despite the influence of society and the political climate in the background of the events as it sensed it; and its impact on The characters of the story that suffer the defeat, but it came as a little separate from the events though His close relationship. I would have liked the writer to have paid a little attention to this part .. Ibn Arabi, the cordon of jasmine and the mystical atmosphere that was appearing lightly. I would have liked to have elongated a lot, but he gave the novel a special glow and a transparent spiritual dimension .. There is no doubt that the scattered sexual details caused a lot of distress and distracted me. About integrating into events .. In my opinion, part of the writer&#39;s creativity is to convey to his reader the feeling he wants without using an explicit or detailed description of sexual scenes, and without causing alienation from the rest of the novel as a whole. This has been preceded by many writers who succeeded in developing using the most exemplary, gentle and sweet words, which give the suggestion without provoking imagination or putting images in mind without permission or prior preparation, especially since I consider that the reader during the novel is without other types of intellectual books that require Realizing the mind with her delivers somewhat his imagination and mind to the writer, so he inclines the characters and identifies with them. The writer should also respect those who read to him and take into consideration the quality of his reader with different directions of readers and the general character of the committed Arab reader .. In general, I was not convinced of it as a novel, perhaps because of the recurring narration technique in letters that sometimes send boredom and which inspired me that I am only opening a memoir book To read from him, no narrated novel related to the events .. It is as in the subtitle on the cover .. Letters .. Despite the beauty of the language, the transparency of words and the beautiful judgment of life .. However, there are incomplete things .. Finally: it is not among the novels that I can recommend to others.

The genius of the first experience lies in the difference in innocence in smoothness, and this was done by the editor, director, and director Ahmed Abdullah completely in his first experience. Heliopolis movie. This film, which belongs to the so-called independent cinema, that cinema that came to light in search of freedom Outside the grip of major production companies. In Heliopolis, the difference in everything was in the scenario, lighting, montage, sound, and sometimes acting. Ahmed Abdullah and his team succeeded in breaking several tabs on top of which was the movie scenario, as the film is almost without a story, and there is no dramatic conflict in it or any climax, and the characters are completely superficial. Unpainted, you move on paper and you remain trapped during the movie without meaning or aim, causing you to be affected. The lighting of the film is a miraculous rebellious thing, which is only flawed because it is not present in the internal scenes and sometimes not in the external scenes. As for the stranger, it is the montage, as the director of the work has experience in the field of montage, and when he made his first movie as a director and wrote his story and his scenario, he chose a story for four separate dramatic strings that he only collects in Heliopolis. It is known that such quality needs a very sensitive and accurate montage to make The viewer does not feel the transition from one thread to the next, but from the seemingly long-term difference, the moves were terrifying at times, uncomfortable at all times. So here the difference ends and the innocence adopted by the director in the performance of his actors begins and everyone falls into the trap of inattention, except for a little. Khaled Abu Al-Naja is a spotlight in the film with his smooth and convincing performance. Hanan Mutawa led a character who almost drew well within the limits of the amputated character dramatically, even if the error is not her fault Hani Fair unconvincing performance and an attempt to perform the introverted personality by looking at the land and hum for the degree of illness Yusra al-Lawzi is still satisfied with her beautiful face only on the screen, but the rest of the staff performed as far as possible, even if Ahmed Abdallah&#39;s insistence on the silence of the soldier Muhammad Barkaa the unreasonable in many cases his silence He damaged the dramatic streak of the soldier as a whole and made him a short film inside the film, and the genius that they announced did not appear in these scenes. And it remains smooth to transfer this independent film to the film strips to be displayed in theaters under the independent movie slogan, as if that sentence should be after. If the possibilities of this cinema do not allow all of this, and we have to overlook it in order to move to another level on the ladder of independent cinema, it remains to shout at the filmmakers all the amount of boredom that inhabited the film from its inception until the end of it to the extent that even the sympathizers of the first experience lost their sympathy. Finally, Heliopolis remains alive, and the film is not a wonderful life. Its history cannot be reduced to the time of foreigners, the fifties and earlier, and the new millennium in a humiliating shorthand for about forty years from the history of the neighborhood and Egypt as a whole. A final note: When making a movie about Heliopolis, please refer to laughing, playing, grandfathering and love for Tariq Al Tlemceni, and in the apartment of Heliopolis for Muhammad Khan.

She knew that their relationship was not deep, but she said to herself that it is not necessary for the emotional bond to occupy a priority in the list of married couples, especially for a married couple, a long time has passed since their marriage. The divine things that any husband may offer is forgiveness, but love is secondary compared to all these things unless one lives in the folds of novels or romantic films where heroes always depict larger people from life and their love is nothing but a myth. . As if you can get to know a man’s personality during eight months. My father and I have been married for twenty years, and yet we cannot pretend that one of us knows everything about the other that eight months is not considered anything in any relationship. . The twenty-first century does not differ much from the thirteenth century and they will note in history that these two centuries were an era of religious conflicts to an unprecedented extent and an era in which cultural misunderstanding and a general feeling of insecurity and fear of the other prevailed and in such times the need is To love more severe than ever. . When you kill someone, something of him transmits to you a sigh, smell, or gesture. I hang them around my neck like hidden necklaces. I feel they are firmly and heavily above my flesh. Even though I do not feel comfortable, I used to live with this burden and accepted it as part of my work. Since Cain killed Abel, in every killer the man who killed him breathes, this is what I know and it does not bother me. . . Inside each person there is a hidden desire to kill one of them one day, and people do not realize this until after they have spoken to them, they think that they are unable to kill, but the issue is a matter of conscience only. Sometimes a mere gesture is enough to inflame their anger. One is in the wrong place and at the wrong time, as destructive tendencies can appear in people who are kind and respectful people in normal circumstances, as anyone can kill anyone, but no person can deliberately kill a stranger. . Believe me, there is nothing new. I have clients from the most parts of the world. After dosing some cups, I hear the same stories from all of them. People are themselves everywhere, the same food, the same water, and the same old folly. . The way in which we see God is only a reflection of the way we see ourselves, so if God did not bring to our minds nothing but fear and blame, then this means that a great deal of fear and blame is flowing in our souls, but if we see God filled with love and mercy, we will be like that. . This is how life is. When you tell someone the truth, he hates you, and the more you talk about love, the more it hates you. . Whatever we are or wherever we live, we feel in our hearts that we are incomplete, as if we lost something and must recover it, but most of us never find that thing. As for those who can find it, very few dare to go out and search for it. . Do not judge the way people communicate with God, so each person has his own way and prayers that God does not take us with our word, but looks in the depths of our hearts and not the rites or rituals that make us believers, but whether our hearts are pure or not. . One of the things that helped me personally in the past to stop interfering in the affairs of others around me and when I was frustrated months that I would not be able to change them I was instead of intrusion or negativity I was inclined to acquiescence some people mistake when they mix between compliance and weakness, so compliance is a form of peaceful acceptance On the terms of the universe, among which are things that we cannot currently change or understand. . Thought and love consist of different materials. Thought binds humans in a contract, but love dissolves all nodes. Thought always warned, and he advises: Beware a lot of euphoria, while love says: Do not care. I take this risk and while thought cannot fade. Easily, love collapses easily and becomes a rubble on its own, but the treasures are hidden between rubble and the broken heart hides treasures. . Most of the world&#39;s problems stem from linguistic errors and from a simple misunderstanding that does not take words in their apparent meaning at all, and when the circle of love enters, the language that we know is outdated. The thing that cannot be expressed in words can only be perceived by silence. . Loneliness and being alone are two different things. When you are alone, it is easy to fool yourself and imagine that you are on the right path. As for being alone is better for us because it means being alone without feeling that you are alone, but in the end it is better for you to search for someone who is like a mirror You remember that you cannot really see yourself except in someone else&#39;s heart and with God in you. . No matter what happens in your life, and no matter how troublesome things appear, do not enter despair, and even if all the doors remain closed, God will open a new path for you. Ahmed, your Lord, it is easy for you to praise God when everything is fine. The Sufi praises God not only for what He granted to him, but praises Him Also for everything that God has forbidden it. . Patience does not mean that you bear the difficulties negatively, rather it means being far-sighted so that you trust the end result that will result from any process. What does patience mean? It means that you look at the thorn and see the rose, you look at the night and see the dawn. As for impatience, it means that you are short-sighted and you cannot see the result that God&#39;s lovers never run out of patience because they know that in order for the crescent to become full, it needs time. . There is no big difference between east and west, south and north. Whatever your destination, you must make the journey you take a journey inside you. If you travel inside you, you will be able to cross the vast world and beyond. . When the midwife finds that the pregnant woman does not suffer during labor, she knows that the path is not clear for her newborn, so she will not give her newborn if and in order to generate a new soul, it must be pain and just as the clay needs high heat to intensify, love is not complete except with pain. . The pursuit of love changes us, so no one seeks love and matures during his journey, so when the search for love begins, it starts to change from inside and outside. . There are fake teachers and fake professors in this world with many stars in the visible universe. Do not confuse selfish people who are motivated by power and true teachers. An honest spiritual teacher directs your attention to him and does not expect absolute obedience or complete admiration from you but rather helps you to appreciate yourself The Ministry of the Interior respects that true teachers are as transparent as crystal passing through God&#39;s light through them. . Because you are very keen to obtain the approval of others, you will not get rid of their criticism, whatever you try. . Do not try to resist the changes that stand in your way, but let life live in you and do not worry if you turn your life upside down so how do you know that the side you are used to is better than the side that will come. . I do not think that there is a problem with sadness, but rather the opposite is hypocrisy that makes people happy. As for the truth, it makes them feel sad. . The true filth lies inside, while the other filth is removed by washing, and there is one type of filth that cannot be cleansed with pure water, which is a pollute of hatred and intolerance that pollutes the soul. . If a person wants to change the way in which people treat him, he must first change the way in which he treats himself and if he does not learn how to love himself completely and sincerely, there is no way in which he can love, but when he reaches that stage he will thank every thorn that others have thrown at him. This indicates that Roses will rain down soon, then how can one blame others for not respecting him if he does not consider himself worthy of respect. . The past is a vortex, if you let it dominate your present moment, it will absorb you and sweep you away from what time is but an illusion and all you need is to live this very moment. This is all that matters. . Do not care where the road will lead you, but focus on the first step, as it is the most difficult step that you must take responsibility for. Once you take that step, let everything happen naturally and the rest will come by itself. Do not go with the current, but be the current. . The Internet has exaggerated behavior outside its scope and made it gentle, giving the opportunity to flirt without having to feel guilty and adventurous without risk, as if to eat delicious food forbidden without worrying about you due to the extra calories. . How can love be so serious?

What you deem unpalatable. You have the right to re-read, jump on pages or other rights. They are flexible rights, and it is you who grant and give them as soon as you start reading the book.

The story talks about a woman who suffers from the bad treatment of her husband and beat him to her, and how she escaped from this by entering into a forbidden relationship with a married man who finds the lost love with him. In the novel, the author reviews various stories of women: her mother, who lives with a sexually cold husband, her widowed friend, who was betrayed by love when death kidnapped her husband, and she quenched her instinct with temporary relationships with men, and the story of her aunt who died a virgin because she loved a man her father refused to marry. And other stories all revolve around the axis of women who are emotionally abused, physically stolen, and morally degenerate. The story is not as bad as I expected. After I read the account of attention to AlbertoMoravia, I did not find this novel bolder. The narration in the novel is traditional. The raving element is missing at the end of the novel.

Well, I always have the same dilemma with books like this. Do I take it seriously? I discuss ideas, accuracy of transmission, correctness of information, presentation style, and writer style. Or do I set the record straight and say that this book is just another nonsense from what Ahmed Khalid writes? While I might like the book a little, it is still light in shade. However, I will not consider it a book in the full sense of the word. It is just thoughts. The writer saw that he had a good cultural kit that would qualify him to write on a subject of such importance, so he took advantage of his name and fame, and his many followers, who might buy even blank papers, just because his name is on them, so he took advantage of his luxury and decided to write this thing that I do not know him So far any precise name .. I have no objection at all to the idea of simplifying things a little, on the contrary, it is a good idea in any case. But to seek your enormous imagination and add things that have nothing to do with existence and call this a summary of the most important philosophical ideas, this is the defect. Here it is, nothing, pure bullshit. It can make any passionate reader interested in knowing philosophy be satisfied forever and pastoralize just thinking about it again. Are you talking about foolishness? Or about the fallacies in the book? Or about the intense fooling of great ideas that are still fueling discussions in any intellectual arena? Or am I talking about the writer&#39;s disdain for his readers and distorting everything? In general, the book is ridiculous, full of fools, and never deserves neither the trouble of reading, nor the trouble of writing about it, but my anger from wasting my time decided to take revenge .. This book is a somewhat misrepresentation and distortion of the novel of a Sufi scholar, but of course in the form of a brief summary and disgraceful as well. Again, another attempt with books that simplify philosophy sarcastically is doomed to failure .. I think this is the main reason, if you want to write then try even a little bit to stick to the sources and references. And not to deviate from the context of science and literature as well, but mockery and satire do not make me eager, of course, to read.

This does not rule out the existence of some anecdotal texts that bear a sincere feeling, and I think this is what distinguishes the author most. However, the mixing of the style of blogging with the style of fictional writing led to something similar to water dilution, so the book became more lean. Does this mean that blogging weakens the language? This depends on the author&#39;s view of him. Among the writers is someone who respects writing in all cases and looks at blogs as channels for publication, so he writes faithfully what he writes in paper books. But many view it as a white card that allows the author to license everything and override the language on the pretext that these are not literary texts; these are notations. . I suffered in the book from abundant linguistic mistakes, mistakes everywhere and everything, even in the simplest of rules. I suspect that the reason is the weakness of the writer&#39;s language and the book&#39;s reviewers as well, as long as all these errors have gone under their noses without noticing. For example, how does a writer in Al-Fusha who like to say that one eyebrow is raised and does not feel stabs in his ears like? And, worse, how can he do this twice in the same book, separated by only a few pages; the same phrase with the same two errors? . This is a simple example, and the mistakes are not only in grammar, but in many linguistic and verbal methods. She says, for example, in a position: I put my leg under me and it is a very colloquial expression in the wrong’s way, so what is this from me that puts its leg under it? It is nice that Rehab writes in Arabic far from colloquially, while she originally studied it in English literature, meaning that she has something that might motivate her to write in English, but I would like her to be more jealous of the Arabic that she preferred.

Ostensibly, the novel is divided into two parts. The first part of it is related to his father, mother, and illness, and the disease is the weak link from which the writer moves to the second part of the jinn and demons to the end of the multiple horror features that he put in order to attract everyone, and I see that this multiplication reflected negatively on the novel. In the first line that started the novel, a very simple problem appears that almost completely bled the novel out of its roots, which is the hero’s injury with Coro’s disease, due to the fact that the writer is not a specialist or only satisfied with the information available on this disease on Wikipedia until you find the text transmission from the site, And to avoid this loophole and put a weak possibility of suffering from this very rare disease that does not exist in Egypt, it is not by eating the flesh of his father’s body but by eating his father’s brain and that his father traveled to Guinea or let us say to Africa in general. The events pass to find the beginning of the transformation and the emergence of the second line of the novel, which is surprising, I find no justification in its existence from the ground, especially after having good lines for the direction of the first regardless of its gaps, but it is clear that there is consensus at the present time that the book does not achieve the highest sales Or fame, unless he belongs to the literature of horror or in other words, the current fashion of writing is the literature of horror, and I do not reduce these words from the literature of horror or the talented book in it, but I am a fan of it and if I see that this subject has psychological and social conclusions of our own as Egyptians. It is clear to what extent the writer has been affected by Western culture, especially in horror movies and series. I found a series. . He imposes himself on my mind with too much force. The point where the child put his hands in his ear and murmured with the melody of a song, I felt that it came out of me from a medium-rated horror movie. I find it inappropriate for our society or the social class to which the hero is supposed to be attributed. How many points in this part more than mentioned. .

In each of the twelve reports included in the book, a woman is called R, a personality is different in her circumstances, she is a mother of ten children at one time and one child at one time, a researcher here and a simple employee there ... etc., but she is always behind, because the characters complete with their reports a testimony about a moment in time Sad, surprising and ironic. All the writings of the book, including those of me, Radwa, are also shared by its various circumstances in sensitivity and alienation from a surprising, ridiculous and sad reality. The publisher wanted to call it a fictional set, because I said it was not a novel. In fact, they are separate texts that complement each other. It is, however, despite the relative critical silence, an experience I love. . This is what Dr. Radwa said about her book Mrs. R&#39;s reports. Radwa Ashour is Radwa Ashour, concerned with politics, enchanted with literature, preoccupied with history and identity, and in these reports specially add her writings with a pleasant caress that sometimes accompanies you with a pure smile on your apartment while moving between her reports .. Dr. Radwa goes and comes through her book The reports of the woman behind smoothly and smoothly, she travels From Africa, America and Europe, as you move through the times with remarkable lightness, and it does not give you the opportunity to marvel, but rather your exchange, informative and justified, I hope the reader will not be confused, because writing in modernity allows for a time shift, so the writer, especially in the first reports, is present with her scientific, cognitive and real weight .. three Only. They are only three reports who insisted on clinging to my mind after finishing a page book. Do you not notice that it is a strange coincidence that the number of pages of the book in the model of the vehicle of Mrs. Ra Fiora / Victory come from a small size in about three hours or more than about half an hour, except The three reports for reasons that did not attract me .. In Mrs. R’s reports on Cambridge with two domains, the academic professor with the attendant childhood presence of Mrs. R will prevail over all phases of Radwa, and while you find her sympathizing with the empire that the sun set off on and where the first Cambridge is located, you will find that she does not care about the country of Cambridge The second one Always repeat with her Iraq and Palestine and other matters ... The mother is reflected in the sad report, sparking the struggle of generations, while Radwa Tamim expressed her admiration for Jamila Boubacha, defending her and the beauty of the Algerian revolution, answering her is your generation ...?, The same generation that expelled the French once again Other, the million martyrs multiplied .. Then .. Then the funeral, and what a report, O Radwa, that the head was exhausted from the many questions and inquiries that I did not know about the kings of our bright bright people .. Kings are from the deaths of Gregorian and noble understanding .. I betrayed them, because I have not yet documented the events and their backgrounds, even though I have not even complained about my satisfaction On Arabic Wikipedia.

I don&#39;t know the review, a little long, but to burn my blood from wasting my time in the novel. First: They talk about the Sadat period, the high prices, the peace and openness treaty, and sectarian strife represented by an employee who takes money in order to inform the workers of the company to receive Sadat and his guests. All this is fine. We are also annoyed by the terms of the peace treaty and visiting Jerusalem, but what burns my blood is that most of the novelists are supporters who work as novels and look On the misfortune of Sadat’s period, and no one in two articles does anything about any need for the Nasiriyah period, which is repression, forgery, ending democracy, purely misleading media, the loss of Sinai, and other needs .... It means what was written in the novel on state security and that the corrupt hero of the novel was caught in January Lissa intifada forces means the repression Mafeesh good story of one of the first told by grep Khamis and executed for her Gaahahaddat Kamshish Tjapelln. Ok, the workers are looking for money that is not well known. I am not aware of Za’al Abdel Nasser, so I want a busy reception when he came back from Bandung. We talked about the Socialist Union and the pioneer organization and their role… Many other needs, but the Nazarenes see corrupt needs during the era of Sadat. He doesn’t go through, and we also see the same needs but we will see violations And corruption during the era of Nasser works from which myths are not novel. Second: Every bit in the novel, the hero speaks to himself and discharges, and says words where he went, and God, and how he guided us to his paradise, so how did he abandon us? Then he says an idiot. Words he meant and I do not want to say what I do not know. And a little owner says to the hero, it is necessary to marry, you will work as a fighter Lenin, I will marry, and we will go far, why Abdel Nasser is married, and the Prophet Muhammad hit the record What is the matter? We will see the messenger need shit. Third: Every page is narrated in the cam line of a story and no click, I do not understand the required talent, and do not understand what I want to say. It was possible to perform two stars because of the manifestations of corruption in the life that he said during the era of Sadat. Indeed, they existed, but for the reasons I mentioned last, the last star, and there was no zero.

It is worth noting that I did not find any insult or appeal against religion, but I found an appeal in the companions questioning the belief ... So what are you waiting for more than that? The book explains the truth that is absent from achieving the Islamic caliphate, and what will happen if it is achieved and the mechanisms to achieve it, will it succeed in solving the state&#39;s problems economically, socially, religiously ... and so on. The writer confirms his ideas during the period of Sayyidina Uthman and after that the killing of Uthman, a mandate for the rule of the Umayyads, the rule of the Abbasids. Some Umayyad and Abbasid rulers mentioned separately ... But: The clarifications that the writer referred to during this period did not add to the balance of my knowledge anything because it is a period that no one knows about it and many interpretations abound that a so-and-so hero is a serial killer ... and he mentioned this period Either clarifies: that the Islamic religion is not static that its teachings, orders, and intentions cannot be taken as a divine thing that cannot be changed and that it changes with time by virtue of the period in which we live .. and it has been expressed that usury is permissible in cases and is not considered static. Or, either he makes clear: Islam is not a religion and a state, and that Islam is in Alain and the state is our life and what we can do or change with our hands, and he explained this by mentioning the ugliness of the actions of some Umayyad or Abbasid caliphs ... and he was inflicted upon our master Uthman himself ... what excites me that he talks about a period Mysterious, no one is sure about what happened with her and confirms his views during this period .. And I say if this period is mysterious, how can you build on it the foundations and ideas ..? With the idea of the Islamic state that they are unable to set up a program to run this country, which is for It puts a secular program to see a secular state. .

After the novel concluded the truth I was confused. Let me talk about the novel colloquially. First, the novel does not have a plot. Meaning, we can divide the novel into novels. The novel, up to the first page, is her story revolving around Marwan and his journey with the draft novel that I want to write. During his trip, he falls in love with two boys and betrays them with his next and one blue, so I had no taste ... which was the most ridiculous part of the novel. The second section, Biddour, on Marwan Al-Ali during his journey in search of an idea for the novel that I want to write, to discover a book in which state security secrets reveal the involvement of members of the anti-drug police with drug dealers in facilitating trade in exchange for a percentage of profits and the Arabic film that we sure heard about before that. This part is quite acceptable. The next section is Bidour about Marwan and his involvement with Hamas in Palestine because of his brother Mazen who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is a branch of Hamas in Egypt .. The important thing is Marwan is kidnapped and does a certain task in Palestine and in the end they change his name and identity and flee to Switzerland .. The tale is empty. Of course, it was necessary to burn some events in order to clarify the general atmosphere of the novel and the reason for the lack of plot, even if the one who burned it did not live from the novel. The important. The novel feature has two needs. The most wonderful style for a young writer, and this is his first novel. The second need is the last part of the novel that took place in Palestine. This was the real fun part. The disadvantages of the novel are many, but some of them can be overlooked as the novel is the writer&#39;s first work. First, the dialogue at the beginning of the novel, the writer made a mistake in it, and I found it previously in youth novels more than once .. It is a topic that mentioned the names of the two parties to the dialogue within the dialogue. This makes the dialogue appear as if it is a dialogue with a translated or dubbed movie. ..But this point gradually disappeared in the second text of the novel, and it almost disappeared in the last part. The second disadvantage is that the characters are not adequately drawn. Most of the characters came out very superficial..and many personalities appeared and disappeared unnecessarily. The third defect I mentioned earlier is that there is no plot. The novel can be divided into separate stories. The fourth disadvantage is the lack of consistency of events at a certain rate. Sometimes the events are very fast, sometimes they are very slow. Despite all of this, the novel is good. The beautiful style of the narration and the standard language compels me to overcome defects and I say that the work is good. The novel, compared to other youth novels, is ranked higher than many of the idiots who gained fame and deserved approval. Waiting for other works and better development, God willing

Very simply, Mahmoud Darwish in this book did not have the poet’s sense nor the writer’s sense of thought, so he described it devoid of any feeling with the absence of the subject&#39;s unit horribly and the absence of a tone in the words, then it is not rhyming or free poetry nor a simple poem, and the writer himself appears in this book as if he is not familiar I reached it in Arabic using the word from the general public to be a fragile companion of eloquence and the public tongue. Therefore, I did not like his style or even his subjects. I did not feel what I read and did not feel in it any literary type, as it is inferior to being classified as poetry but rather fits into the simple prose ranks. My first trip is the last in the world of dervish, poetry in all its kinds is like the sea and we readers are the pioneers of ships in it. It is authorized to sail, bound, free from its passengers, as the captain&#39;s poetry is free of authenticity, longstanding description, and photography. I would like to point out that this is my personal feeling towards this office, and it may collide with the opinions of readers who do not share the same viewpoint with me, but this is what I felt while reading this book and I honestly reported it here.

Rather, it did not rise to be a mirror of something related to Nizar Qabbani ... even the way in which love appeared through it did not reflect his personality or his poetry filled with his poems. The novel is nothing more than an account of the diaries of an eastern lover .. And the beginning of the novel was stronger than its end. :. The woman offers her abundant affection, and the man thrives on her.

The virtuous prostitute, and please do not ask how to be a prostitute and virtuous at the same time. The question to someone other than God is humiliating, my brother. The virtuous prostitute has a mythical theory that she has no objection to granting her vagina to everyone who donates and bears, but no one has the right to accept her except her lover ... No, by God ? Really? Are kisses not part of the body? . I don&#39;t understand is a bitch selling her body and not selling her soul? Or is her soul only focused on her lips? Then what about her vagina? Does her lover have the right to pierce him, or does her spiritual lover only have to touch her lips? . Any nonsense, no shit.

There are jugglers and there are swindlers who treat people with fish, laughter, and yoga, the whole world It is considered that writings such as Eric von Dunkin fall within the scope of false science and review through the web the hypothesis of ancient astronauts and you will see that Egyptologists and real history scientists see that such words do not relate to science and not everything that glitters gold reaches sales of writings e A Swiss researcher, as we have admittedly argued that he is a true researcher to a million books annually and wrote more than one book. In fact, the classification of such works as false science or writings falsely or falsely depends on the nature of the science itself, which relies on refutation, not emphasizing material, not on fiction. Therefore, this man&#39;s writings are popular, while for example, we do not expect that the latest writings of physicists will reap the same sales. They are simply like science fiction novels, but they are sophisticated. It is not possible to subject the jinn and ghosts to scientific studies, so all scientists except for the supporters of the false science consider that ghosts and jinn have reasons. Psychological and nervous And some people measured the electromagnetic impulses in some places that everyone claims contain ghosts, then they found that these pulses in these places are very high and that it is the reason that affects people’s minds and because of the spread of popular accounts around a place that has ghostly children or a woman who wears a costume Moein claims many people that they saw the same ghost, then the scholars met by comparing the testimonies of many people who were subjected to these experiments and found that the testimonies, despite their closeness, are not the same as what denies the existence of ghosts, and this is why science is called knowledge on this basis, the idea that I measure on it was Brother / Eric F. And Duncan believed in these metaphysical beings mainly regardless of his evidence in the sixty books. So why does he not try to prove that God sent from the sky angels metaphysics and taught human beings how to build civilizations if we were going to fade in the name of science and say that aliens visited the earth and built civilizations and evidence is these drawings and these stones Etc. What prevents many scholars from believing the existence of God Almighty, knowing that I, praise be to God, is a believer and a Muslim. I am talking about scholars if you deny what you do not see in the name of science. Why do some of you call these perceptions a note, no, masters of science has a different path from religion and spirituality And science is characterized by people Von Duncan must first prove the existence of aliens and work with other research teams to establish the existence of other rational beings other than us in space as well as to be advanced because, for information, many hypotheses about the universe say in a clear way, but there are rational and non-advanced beings and therefore do not communicate With Earth, as for there are basically no sane creatures, there are also living beings. As for there is no life essentially outside the planet Earth, despite the observation of the Hubble Observatory of many planets outside or inside the galaxy, but they are so far away that they cannot be studied closely to make sure they are simply valid. The bottom line is not all What shines in gold Von Duncan began writing his books in the year, during which time he talked about the aliens under the American and Russian space programs and also because of the American flying tests that relied on camouflage through these false novels, but his books did not achieve wide spread until after a movie and series. Stargate Gate of the Stars in the year and although it is an amusing movie but it falls under the broad science fiction item and then after the popularity that these ideas acquired cinematically and in science fiction novels, these proponents of false science began to promote the same hypotheses on a non-scientific basis Gentlemen, he has a well-known style on von Duncan that proves the existence of aliens mainly whether in the planets near us or far away and to obtain clear archaeological evidence from there then for him to claim that they were guests on the ground, how do we accept this insult to us in the recent period what The Egyptians are deprived of their history in the name of the Jews and the servitude of the Children of Israel sometimes and in the name of magic sometimes and now the people of space are sometimes important for the Egyptians to appear ignorant and backward and did not build the pyramids What is this ridiculous .. Why do we not believe the writings of the claimants from the Arab world that the pyramids were built by a people returned and Thamud and why do not we take a long time In absurdity is more art And because he returned and Thamoud mainly from the people of space, no one asked himself who owns the spacecraft how he does not have the video and recording techniques, so he records what he saw on the caves and stones, who owns the spacecraft, how does he not have television, medicine, antibiotics, and everything related to human civilization with a link then scientists begin Pseudo-pseudo-deviation is more in search of a solution to this dilemma and they find nothing more than stupidity in envisioning a catastrophe for which there is no scientific evidence except for one book by Aristotle on a land not related to Egypt and may have sunk signed and toppled all this if that was the case then it makes sense that this catastrophe will topple the life that We know it and it will topple the stone before Els The satellite is soft and it is logical that more than three thousand years of archaeological research and exploration that we will find any technical method and not only a stone that proves that a great civilization preceded the present time ... Whoever searches more will know the responses of the doctor and the distinguished scientist / Zahi Hawas on these peer-to-peer because it is an archaeologist He has a capacity and he can argue with them on the pretext and opinion ..

I was going to this restaurant a year ago. It was the best roast, but now it is very bad .. Those who serve it are Turkish people. They treat them badly with customers .. Their souls with their weight can consider this job less than them? God knows best we asked to eat what came as we asked .. we asked to return it twice and the barkers say nothing with us, but it is ringing .. knowing that he is the one who forgot the request as we told him .. the bill came up high and I reviewed it with him and my brother says I asked him to climb a mountain .

Historical writing has origins and rules, it is never easy to enter a historical era rich in events and decide to write a novel about it, the natural path that most amateurs will take is the direct narration of events and dealing with historical events directly with the addition of side characters that meet in the middle of the novel to reach the peak, but the most difficult It is to make the events of the novel a reflection of what is happening on the ground, that the historical events are merely a snapshot in the background, but its strong influence is evident in the course of the events of the novel, the novel unfortunately took the first course .. I was not optimistic about the good when the author decided to explain at the beginning of his novel some of the historical events He directly feared, and I feared that this was due to his expectation of the quality of his readers who may not know much about this period, but when I reached the end of the novel I found that nothing new was presented on the level of what he presented in his previous works that relied on excitement and surprise, tales that do not rise to the level of the novel The historical, a direct narration of the events and faded backgrounds, figures that have no dimensions or depth, any character in the novel that can completely erase it from the novel and that will not affect the final work, a summons to scenes we saved from the many cinemas presented in films in our home by a man, sunrise, sunset, and series of Ismail Abd Old Hafiz and others, I thought that Hamad Murad to keep him on his audience, who knows him well and give him what is looking for the thrill and exciting, and there are several quick points I would like to conclude by. I do not think it is appropriate for the author to continue to mix between the paschal and the vernacular, to the extent that he decided to write a popular example of al-Qahb with classical. The characters are rushed to take actions that contradict the image he drew, as the coward suddenly turns into a brave and traitor to my homeland. There are some passages in the novel written in a different script, which means that they may be memoirs of the historical figures covered in the novel, and I suspect that he should have mentioned that at the end of the novel. The writer made a great effort to collect historical events and link them together

This is in terms of the style of Akkad, but in terms of what came in the book from the analysis of the attitudes of the Prophet, whether they were political, war, and religious life situations, the contract was according to issues and was unsuccessful in other subjects. Topics related to the establishment of the Prophet and the signs of Mawlid were successful in it and contained new information added to me The issues related to Muhammad&#39;s military genius are always the thorny one. When talking about the Prophet, unfortunately, Akkad was not convincing to me. He relied only on comparisons and moved away from logic.

I tried to search for some of what was mentioned in the book in the Google search engine, but I did not reach any result remember, let alone match it to what the author mentioned, maybe I did not search correctly or that this information does not exist, or I should be skeptical about it. The book was characterized by exaggeration, and pictures of the space people in the way that American films depict, exactly if there were residents of other planets who may not necessarily be like the image imposed on us .. Then what about the space helmets? If they are more developed and advanced than us, they will have their own technologies that are not necessarily similar to ours, such as helmets, ships, planes and clothes. The book included some pictures of antique drawings that support his words, but it made me confused. For example, I pondered a long time about one of the drawings that the writer says is that of a woman who has a hairstyle and who wears socks and pants. In general, the author reckons his fertile imagination .. For me, everything that I read must pass the balance of the Qur’an and the correct prophetic Sunnah. In the Qur’an there is no mention of rational creatures created by God, but the angels, humans, jinn and the last two are the ones charged with. If we assume that there are inhabitants of other planets, and this possibility may be possible, then it is not a miracle of God, then they will not be but among these three. Unless they have their own messengers and books and we cannot talk about what we do not have knowledge .. Also why is the distant assumption that who came from heaven are aliens, they may be angels, and angels have knowledge that we do not know, as it was stated in the Qur’an that the two angels Harut and Marut have They went down with the people of Babel, teaching them magic to have a temptation, and there are many signs that indicate the descent of the angels and embody them in human beings .. Why is also the other assumption that our human race is unable to develop its own civilizations without the intervention of aliens? Humans who have come to this development in this era are not unique in their kind, and there must be throughout the history geniuses and scientists have come to more than what modern man reached from the sciences, and those sciences have disappeared, including alchemy, alchemy, alchemy and others. Let us take into consideration that the ancients were their longest ages, reaching hundreds of years, and have a long time to learn, develop, teach, and reconstruct the earth, but this is God’s year in his being, nations appear, prevail, degenerate, fall out, and appear. Others do not know much about their predecessors, and so on .. Generally the book makes you think and research a lot.

It may be factional, class, or ideological demands, for example what is happening in Thailand now, and its demands are not always fair or reasonable and may be against democracy in some cases by exclusion and intimidation, it is in The end is an expression of the demands of a part of society, and not all of society has less or more in number and proportion in the state. B revolution, in general, is not the only way to change, and there are other ways to change and reform. C revolution may turn into a separate obsession, desire or passion, regardless of the community&#39;s need or reading the reality. D revolution is an ongoing process in the sense of change, not in the sense of demonstrations and clashes. Is it necessary to dismantle the concept of the revolution itself: What do we mean by the term revolution? Is it a people&#39;s uprising against power only ... or is it a broader concept than that on the socio-political level and not on the individual level. Is the officer the number that went out in demonstrations, for example? Or is it the type of claims and the desired change? Or is it geographically expanded to include a greater number of cities and geographical regions? Then the most important question:. What is it based on? What is based on our agreement that the people really came out of a revolution after we defined and defined its conditions? Is every revolution obligatory to meet its demands legally and constitutionally? Or is there a legal and constitutional cover required for the demands of any revolution? New notes: February:. The author is not an academic and only. I remembered from Ressala&#39;s book On the Way to Our Culture that orientalists were studying Muslim societies and presenting the results of their studies to the rulers of the West so that they could direct them to what they wanted. And our author is not far from that. Trying to study the paths of revolutions and model them is nothing but an intelligence effort to guide and transform any revolution in the bud in the bud in the form of what serves American interests. And the twentieth century is full of examples of this ending with the Arab Spring. The second important note. It is the Iranian revolution as a model of a complete revolution opposed to the American interest at the time of its establishment. I had started her study in an analytical study to see how the revolution managed to control the joints of the state, get rid of the old system as a whole, and neutralize or control the army and police and the judiciary quickly. Unfortunately the project was not completed due to the security prosecution. First article link:. : //. . / / .... The third note:. It is the growing role of the media and television channels in general year after year and decade after decade. What Abdel Nasser, Hitler and Mussolini used to say in a sermon inflaming the masses backed by measures on the ground buying the friendliness of the masses such as agrarian reform, for example, or the external threat or the call of ancient Roman nationalism, for example in the case of Mussolini. New leaders have not prepared for all of this. Suffice them with a conspiratorial inflammatory speech focused by the media led by experts of moral guidance through studying the masses and their behaviors. Unfortunately. It appears that the awareness of the masses in general has not developed sufficiently to meet the development of moral guidance methods. They will respond to me, saying that it is the conscious youth and the university students who are leading the opposition to the coup now. I always say young people are the fuel for revolutions. As it happened in January. But they can not manage the helm after overthrowing the system. Or do not have a vision for the post-revolutionary wave. As long as elites and party and community leaders remain captive to old perceptions and ideas. No revolution is completely victorious. I invite you to know what is happening in Thailand and Ukraine now. As examples of failed revolutions in their demands and awareness. In the end, the difference between the true and comprehensive revolution and the factional uprising and narrow popular demands is in seeing this change revolution and the breadth and depth of its demands. What happened in January was an uprising with limited demands. People want to improve conditions. Activists went out against the security crackdown. Islamic currents went out to support the Sharia and enable it to a greater degree. And the revolutions in general that Crenten studied in his book do not fall outside this framework. Most of them were the revolution of the marginalized and oppressed classes against other classes, and thus in the exchange of roles between the classes and some of them. A comprehensive revolution is a revolution that has a clear vision and ideology for reforming conditions in general in the whole world. Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, came up with a revolution from this framework. Islam itself was, is, and will continue to be a revolution against tyranny and slavery when Allah the Exalted, the Majestic. The last and most important note in my opinion was considered the will of a war-weary combatant. The conflict is global and so to speak. Not with Sisi, with a military council, or with kings here and there. This does not mean adopting the option of carrying weapons, for example, on the Al Qaeda method. But. Our knowledge of the depth, breadth and coverage of the problem. It makes us better able to guide it and awareness of its dimensions. How many aborted projects because of the lack of awareness, and the most prominent example that brings me to mind is that Morsi came to Sisi himself, so there is no explanation for me except the lack of awareness .. And in the past the Brotherhood came to Abdel Nasser as well. The revolution must be directed against the real enemy. Awareness first, then to stop cognitive bleeding and mental and intellectual distortion, which they are leading a craft and perform. Then, by adopting the opposite action, let us get out of the circle of reaction and aborted dreams. I borrow this paragraph from an article I recently read for a Syrian writer named Ahmed Daadouch:. Finally, we realize that evading the global Protestant Jewish conspiracy will only take place with a counter plot that possesses the same ingredients, and is woven with the same savvy, and looks at the conflict from a perspective that expands to the whole world and extends for centuries to come, and is based on the intentions of Shari&#39;a gradually when necessary, and realizes that the declaration of a Sunni Islamic state in Any country on the ground today will push the Arabs and the West to fail it before it ripens ...

The series was great and revolutionary in everything .. production, thought, vision, and computer influences .. And it bore a major title:, followed by more than one description according to the historical era .. that dealt with the story of life before the age of dinosaurs, followed by B, then, and finally This is the exact historical arrangement of the series, not the release date. The most important and most successful parts of the era were the dinosaurs, especially since it appeared in the era known to those interested in the field of fossils as the awakening of the second dinosaurs, which was initiated by a group of modern scientific discoveries that turned our attention completely towards these wonderful creatures. The new animation movie shares the L series in the name, production and subject matter, but it differs artistically in everything from what was presented brilliantly in the past. With Hollywood as a 20th century Fox Studio enters as a major production partner, the whole business has gone completely wrong. In the original series we watched a fascinating display of the daily life of dinosaurs, from their debut timidly more than a million years ago, through their full domination of the Jurassic era, and ending with their great extinction in the Cretaceous period a million years ago. All this with an informed, educated, and informative voice commentary, uniquely blending science and art and imagination. Everyone was waiting for the new movie to go in the same way, but it might take it to broader horizons and horrific stages .. Especially with the development of technology it has become possible to provide dinosaurs as we have not seen them before .. In the film, we follow the huge annual migration of a flock of th Bakirinosaura, a herbaceous dinosaur with a long skull spanning four prehistoric northern regions of Canada. The scenario was destined to show the events in the style of Al, that is, a documentary film in a narrative cinematic form .. We were supposed to watch this natural epic with a sober documentary befitting it. This is before the producers finally change their minds and take the movie in a completely different direction that will remind you of the ridiculous cartoon movies we see on TV, especially those aimed at children as young as years. Fox of the twentieth century, producer of the film in the last stages of production, changed its plan from a discreet documentary with a fictional character, to a family movie directed mainly at children, and for this made all the animals in the film speak .. and the result was: complete failure. A hybrid movie that you cannot enjoy its seriousness, nor are you able to indulge in its humor, especially with provocative sounds .. Instead of seeing dinosaurs interacting with each other through roaring, snarling, bellows, and loudness ... we were forced to listen to disturbing conversations that did not stop For one moment throughout the events .. Add to this that the animals&#39; mouths never move, just listen to their thoughts. A group of young Hollywood actors was chosen with voices without distinction and does not offer any pleasure Justin Long in the lead role. The dialogue itself was written in a very disturbing way ... with a very contemporary American joke and ... which will make you wonder: Is this what is going on in the minds of prehistoric dinosaurs? It is the most ridiculous thing that you can see at all .. And to torture further, the filmmakers did not make their dialogue stop for a second to breathe or ease the viewer&#39;s mind, but it continued to be sticky, silly, and annoying throughout the events of the film even in the most dramatic moments ... which It will make you ascetic in the first third hour, and you will try hard to dampen the sounds in your head in any way and enjoy the image only, but without any success in reality. Now what about the soundtrack accompanying the events? Which is supposed in a movie that shows one of the most important major migrations that took place in history to be epic, or at the very least poetic, that puts you in the air that does not take you away from it .. but hey .. here you will listen to a group of the most ridiculous contemporary American songs that vary between Rock, pop, and hip-hop .. and let the air go to hell .. let&#39;s spoil this to everyone in every possible way. One thing you&#39;ll enjoy in the movie is the stereoscopic show ... the one that came out very solid, and very cool. Other than this, you will come out of the theater with a strong headache, and the remnants of annoying voices that never stop gossip inside your head .. The movie met a huge failure in theaters, especially with fierce competition with other animation films that provided real art as your example, where he has achieved so far within America million Only dollars. All in all, I took Hollywood Fantastic Th that everyone loved and turned it into something very ridiculous and vulgar, this is a movie that will not love more children in dinosaurs, but may make them wander with love and feel the absurdity of their unique hobby. Special advice: Don&#39;t go for a walk with the dinosaurs in the theater .. And if you want to see another wonderful movie about dinosaurs going on in the same place as prehistoric Alaska, and deals with the same types of dinosaurs, but with a great deal of greatness and splendor, I recommend you the amazing documentary. Or you can wait a little while the movie&#39;s Blu-ray is released, a version of it will be available without those ridiculous sounds, and also with accompanying different soundtracks .. Only then, you will be able to enjoy your dinosaurs dearly as it should, if you are obsessed with it like me.

Generally, this is what concerns the story ... The character of Hanna Yaacoub was devastating and does not inspire optimism and pain. He was passive and does not inspire life for you. I think that he was very fortunate in his success only. Did you not see him not mentioned with the Druze of Belgrade? The other characters overwhelmed him so much that you wonder where are we?

I only wait for when it will come out and fall into another castle ... It is not my habit to write a review .. But the feelings of discontent with the poker-winning novel prompted me to do so.

The writer insists on polishing Marxism through several pivotal figures in the life of the heroine of the story, such as the slave of the prison fellow, for example. Mr president . The stories and pornography are redundant, and the author described parts of the women’s bodies that are repeated many times ... the portent of Marwa, the husband of the minority son of the minority, and the army officer who refused orders to raise the boy&#39;s childhood companion to attack the prison of Palmyra, an interchangeable figure of the story costing and banishing every Syrian who knows how to purify and liquidate officers The army that is used to plunge into dangerous battles, to win over the rogue sect in this naive way will not do anything, I think that if the writer had been able to write the story in these days, I would reconsider this character ... digression or inherited my extreme boredom, writer digression plus and I noticed that he speaks About side stories almost ten Sik the main story in what I imagined was an increase in the pages of the novel, no more. Companionship in prison affected the heroine to a point that made her turn a degree in her thoughts and beliefs, so she left the prayer in prison and left it without a veil and no longer cares about him, just as she became drinking alcohol, all this effect is irrational to make her endure in prison all this time, because whoever believes in his ideas He is fiercely defended by whoever is able to remain in prison, whatever his orientation, while giving up ideas so easily it foretells of a defeated character who cannot continue to live life ... from racism and ridiculous stereotypes that Islamist women are portrayed with the image of the neglected woman for herself and her beauty, As the heroine was not caring for herself And for her appearance when she was in the group and after her release from prison she became concerned with her elegance and body. Another digression that I did not see any reason for is the story of the Afghan-Soviet war, which was reflected in the story on the character of Safa and her husband Abdullah ... It seems that the writer owns a good ignorance of Islamic movements when he writes that the heroine of the story owns books by Ibn Baz that she considered references to her knowing that she belongs The organization of the Muslim Brotherhood and the two groups have great differences.

The writer followed his writing on the British astronomer Michael Hart&#39;s approach to the book of one hundred most influential characters, which he started by classifying the Prophet of the Nation of Islam, Mustafa Muhammad, peace be upon him, at the top of the list, where the latter tried to collect a figure throughout the ages and times that contributed to crystallizing the world today. And here came the idea of jihad, with only Islamic figures .. I do not hide from you that the book as an idea is a good gesture to introduce young people to Islamic personalities who have rarely heard about them, but there are some notes that raised me positive and negative as well ... What I liked in the book:. The style of suspense in the book, especially the passage between characters, by asking questions that raise the reader&#39;s desire to know the answer .. diversity between characters ... What I did not like about the book:. Restricting to the fighting and political personalities in most of the book&#39;s places and not mentioning one living science scientist, astronomy physics ..... or human sciences philosophy of sociology .... and the Islamic nation does not lack this kind of personalities especially in the golden period of Islam .. Errors Spelling that invaded the book in a strange way .. Thinness in style and repetition, not to mention the use of words that are not worthy of a history book such as: The infidel heretic .... History, sir al-Fadl, calls for complete impartiality in the transmission of events attached to the sources .. The many questions raised in the late characters and Sometimes we find no answer or insufficient answer in places Others, and we can find justification for the fact that the book is limited to five pages, at most, per person. Frankly, I liked the idea of the book. I even bought the book without reading pages from it on the Internet, and it is my method in choosing books. Unfortunately, I thought, the book deserves to be placed next to the children&#39;s family and reading to them whenever the opportunity arises, but taking into consideration correcting spelling errors and deleting other phrases Decency, insult, and slander in personalities, and if they are incompatible with our ideology, then all of his mind thinks about him, and no writer has the right, regardless of the way, to use excesses and exaggerate his religion or doctrine on any other party.

I do not need to repeat it. It is assumed that the novel is interesting, but I could hardly touch it except in a few points. Up to a quarter of the novel, it was assumed, for example, that Professor Naeem died in suicide, and the presumption of murder was not originally destroyed, except for two dimensions, even though from the first it was very clear psychologically that even it was impossible that he would have committed suicide. The novel ends with a surprise, and it contains something of decoding that I did not like. What does it mean that the numbers in the letter are numbers for Surat Al-Baqara, the second verse? What is the goal and what is the important detail in this? Many needs of the novel. And if I have a conviction rate with an idea that the writer wanted to clarify in general that the Jews control is by infiltrating the centers of power and penetrating them into sensitive positions so that they mainly control events, which justifies the Jewish lobby, for example, and the control of a terrible number of American Jews over the press, the media, and the centers of money and power ..

Thus the social aspect in general was extremely naive and superficial. As for her portrayal of the revolution and the sheikh, it was totally unfair and abusive, even though it could have reduced its value and size in a more logical way.

What I liked about the book is its idea and it accepts the writer to search for the truth and research in other religions and not accepting the idea of this is what our father found us .. some weaknesses. The first thing in the book started to liken some religions placed in the Islamic religion and the convergence of their ideas and likeness of the Greek gods to the angels, which makes Islam the object of doubt to those who ask him himself .. Another point is that the writer was blaming the atheists by attacking the religious and describing them as naive while the writer does not find any embarrassment by describing the atheists as arrogance and foolishness and foolishness and imitating them with animals That you don&#39;t agree with. The writer&#39;s view of scientific theories is not that of a researcher for four years. Rather, he was repeating what the common people repeat about the Big Bang and development. He finds that evolution is apes transformed into a human being. Many believers believe in the accuracy of these scientific theories because they basically do not contradict the existence of the Creator. They only explain how things happen without reference to the existence of a Creator or not .. At first, the writer rejects the theory of the Big Bang and then inferred from the Qur&#39;an on the validity of this theory? Have they not seen those who disbelieve that the heavens and the earth were slavery, and we have separated them? In a number of chapters, the author has interpreted the Qur’an according to the likes of most interpretations he wrote, for which no source has been written. I do not think that the Qur’an is a literary or scientific book in which you search for and interpret the facts according to what befits you or what you find appropriate for Islam to defend. Some verses, such as the creation of the fetus, have a scholarly dispute over it, and placing it as a miracle without clarifying the scholarly dispute that may offend religion more than it raises it. Another point concerning science and religion is that some scientific hypotheses invalidate over time. Science is in constant development and modernization. Does this make the Qur’an questionable? Or, it is insulting in religion when some people decide to link the Qur’an to the scientific miracles .. Even at the end of the book, the writer clarifies some verses and links them and their interpretation to the liking of the reader so that he did not agree with them that the Qur’an mentioned faith in the constellations. This is the conclusion of modifying texts for personal purposes. In another chapter, the author regrets the situation of women in Europe during the dark ages, and I would like to see him describe the condition of women in the current Islamic era. And put this point as if it defects Christianity. If his measure of religion is with the hardening that is taking place, then it is more important to consider that ISIS represents the true Islam. What you refuse to your religion do not blame the debt of others. Likewise, Christian militants treated women deservingly, and the extremists of Islam treated them similarly. The writer believes that underdevelopment in Europe at the time was due to religious beliefs and churches. Does he now likewise believe that the cause of underdevelopment in the Middle East is religious beliefs and mosques? The writer also mentioned that the woman’s physical desire outweighs the man and he did not mention any scientific source that proves it. If this information is correct, it will cancel one of the main reasons for legalizing marriage by four, which is to protect the man from engaging in forbidden relationships. As a matter of first, it is permissible to marry four women. In conclusion, the book was different from the best-selling books of these years. I think it deserves an opportunity to read it even if it is not accurate in its content or is broad in other sciences.

Rather, I left her for a week or more until I managed from her after the beginning of a dull, slow, and uninteresting .... evaluation .. only two stars, no more ... The writer is in collecting historical information and keeping pace with the events of the novel ... The main problem for me is a novel that tends to history that is very much loved by myself. The characters of slight dimensions appear as ghosts or as quasi-likes ... I did not merge with them and did not feel them and did not mix with their details and in their dimensions completely like the rest of Murad&#39;s characters in his previous novels .... the cover is distinctive ... out of the totality of the two stars ... the main mix of the novel is a romantic policy Sex Action is a mixture of any novel that seeks to enter the path of satisfaction, often young readers. The controversy surrounding the novel in advance caused it to lose a lot of its splendor ... The defense of Murad&#39;s fans and their apparent bias towards the writer in a western group. The novel is as if it was a sacred book above criticism ... and any of them refused to see others in the level of words or dislike the novel and its price was ... on the margin:. The revolution is on the way to collapse under the weight of the military, as almost happened to a revolution. The souls have not changed ... Saad Zaghloul ... someone needs a study to understand his experience more clearly. The novel is very expensive in its price ... The novel went out with intent from the world of interesting fairy tales to the world of fairy tales of a refined nature, as in our house, for example, a man .... waiting for another work to replace this novel, which I did not enjoy as I had enjoyed before Murad&#39;s previous accounts. ..

However, the exact opposite happened, and Hattan surrendered from his first tour with his mother. Also, I do not know, or are I unable to imagine how Muslim people would analyze themselves forbidden? Do these things have nothing to do with Islam? It is possible that I liked only the novel Haneen, despite her handicap, not that she was strong and did not sit with her hand on her cheek, waiting for the return of Hattan to her. But with the first opportunity for her to marry, she got married and left him as he left her. In short, the novel spoke more about the love of the body than the love of the soul and has a disgusting need. Very good:"
