"we purchased this game about a year ago and all the kids here enjoy playing it ... ages 3 through 10.  it's challenging enough for the older kids to catch the falling butterflies and easy enough for the little ones to gather them up off the floor.  we've had great times with this game and it's quick enough that those with short attention spans can finish the game without upsetting the rest who still want to play.  i've found that the batteries even last quite a while in this one, which is unusual for games of this nature.  the only trouble that i've found with this game is; sometimes the butterflies come out in larger groups rather than a couple at a time.",Positive,Positive,0.046103735
this game is so much fun!  my twin 4yr. old boys just received it for their birthday and it has brought hours of fun to our home.  it promotes great hand-eye coordination and gets them to play together and share!  lots of team work going on here -- they work to pick up all the butterflies after the game is over and put the elephant trunk back in place!  there's so much competition to see who can catch the most butterflies but there's no fighting or arguing!  what a pleasure.the game does go by quick but i think that's great especially when you factor in the attention span of two 4 year olds.  they really need for things to keep moving.  there's no sitting idle with this game.  you've got to be quick on your feet to play!the durability isn't bad but not great either.  you've got to be careful with the nets as to not be too rough and break them.  the elephants trunk needs to be treated with care so that it doesn't get kinked or torn -- i think it could be a bit shorter as well. i do wish that there were more butterflies because it seems as though they'd have even more fun if it didn't go by so quickly.  it really doesn't take long for all the butterflies to come up through the trunk and then it's over.  back to the beginning!i do give this game a 4 star rating just because it is so much fun to watch them play together and get so excited to count how many butterflies each of them have caught at the end of the game!!!,Positive,Positive,0.15072954
"my three year old son saw this advertised and asked for it as a present - the only time he has ever done this for any game or toy.the game comes with:* large blue elephant fan base and translucent plastic trunk* thirty rip-stop nylon butterflies* several butterfly markers for keeping score* four mesh nets for catching butterfliesthe unit requires 4 ""c"" batteries (not included.)when powered on, a quiet fan in the elephant base pushes air up the elephant's trunk forcing the butterflies out. players try to catch the butterflies in their nets. our family has played this game and enjoyed it. catching the randomly fluttering butterflies is an excellent eye-hand coordination activity. and even though the game is geared for younger kids, there is enough of a challenge that all ages can play and enjoy it. (one of the nicest things about the game is that it really does not matter who wins, the game play is fun enough in itself. we don't even keep score and no one minds.)elefun is not without its issues, though:1. plays quickly, but then it takes considerably more time to get it ready for the next round of play than it takes to actually play.2. the trunk has to be extended manually even with the fan on at the beginning of play. once fully extended, it will stay up.3. eats batteries like mad. the fan works best with fresh batteries and the quality of play goes down quickly (not all the butterflies will come out) if the batteries are not 100%. a dc adapter option would have been nice.4. while the entire set is durable, the trunk is a bit suspect. made out of a plastic a bit thicker than a plastic garbage bag, it is subject to holes as it gets repeatedly crinkled during normal play. our son inexplicably took a scissors to it, but fortunately it was repairable (though we lost a bit of length.)all things considered, the game is fun and a good activity for young children. what kind of value it is for the money is debatable - a friend gave us this game, so it's a win-win for us. batteries are an issue, however, and i would seriously recommend purchasing a big set of rechargeables anyway for any parent who buys battery-reliant toys. considering how fast you'll use up batteries with elefun, you'll save money in the long run if you do so.",Positive,Positive,0.36823317
"i will start off by saying that i really don't agree much with the other reviewers.  as a parent, you have to have a little sense in how to operate some of these toddler toys.  they're not made of steel nor are they completely idiot-proof. yes, the trunk does not go up immediately when you turn it on, that's why you're supposed to pull it up yourself, according to the directions.  also, the butterflies have no problem coming out of ours - you can see them when they're about to come out and if they get stuck, just tap on the trunk and out they come.this is such a fun toy for a three-year-old and is marvelous in developing hand and eye coordination.  plus, all the giggles that it creates is just amazing and fun.  i had a bunch of fun playing as did my husband too.  it would be nice if there were a few more butterflies but all-in-all, i'd buy this for everyone i knew.  it's just a great way to entertain children and teach them at the same time.  it is very durable, even the nets but you have to teach the children not to treat them like they're made of flint.  this toy is made to be realistic in the netting so it also is teaching children how to better care for their things.  buy this game, you certainly won't be disappointed.",Positive,Positive,0.3390508
"i look for toys that are fun and easy to play with. i also look for toys that are educational or inspire exploration of the world around them. i want toys that are not really loud as well.this toy fits many of these requirements.my four year old son got this for his birthday and has loved it ever since.like the other reviewers, the trunk does not go all the way up when you first turn the fan on. however, that doesn't take away from the fun of the game. in fact, we just cut the top few inches off of the trunk and that seems to have made the difference.catching butterflies is harder than it looks. that is part of what adds to the fun. they also come out in spurts. you might get four butterflies and then one and then ten. all of this just adds to the fun. catching the butterflies encourages eye and hand coordination and quick thinking.my only complaint is that more butterflies would be fun. there are plenty of butterflies but it doesn't take too long to play because they come out fairly quickly.however, this is great for young children who have a short attention span. you can finish one or two games and call it quits before they get bored.we haven't found this to be a battery eater.in general this is just a fun game with one or two small flaws that are easily overlooked when playing a game with your kids.enjoy.",Positive,Positive,0.06000638
"could have been much better made.  my complaints are the same as some of the other reviewers.  the trunk has to be extended manually at the beginning of each game (maybe more flexible material would have helped).  there need to be way more butterflies, especially since they don't come out right.  at the end of each game there are still a few, if not many, butterflies left inside the bottom.  it also goes through batteries pretty quickly.two year old loves this game so it is worth the bit of hassle for his enjoyment.  i also think this is an excellent way to improve hand-eye coordination and reflexes.  definitely room for improvement but still a decent buy for the price.",Positive,Positive,0.112741016
"i bought this toy for my son's second birthday.  he absolutely loved it but was soon using the net as a swing (he sat on it).  consequently, the toy fell apart and continues to fall apart very easily.  granted, my son shouldn't of sat on it but my two year old wanted to play with it that way. what can you do huh? anyway, even though it falls apart, he likes to turn it on and watch it shake and talk while he kicks the ball into it. when it does fall apart, he can put it back together himself.  this toy would have gotten a better review if it had been made sturdier but that is my only complaint.",Positive,Negative,0.91745555

"i bought this for my 2 year old daughter because her cousin had one and she loved it...all the kids love it. just be weary of them sticking other things inside....we've had to take it apart 3 times already to get other things besides the balls out, but it wasn't too difficult. my son enjoyed it also and learned very quickly to hit the button to start the balls popping...and putting them down the chute is great learning for him also.",Positive,Positive,0.009110826
"this was a gift for my daughters 1st b'day last december and i've just recently opened the box as i didn't think there would be much interest in it. wow! my little girl and my 5 yr old boy both loved it and played with it for about 1 hr and would start over again every time they saw it. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was b/c the balls are very light so the air can ""pop"" them up, so they were sometimes going back into the tube but many times were getting shot onto the floor. fortunately, that was part of the fun for my kids as they raced to get the balls and put them back. they both got their hands stuck in the tube (i guess they reached in there b/c they were curious??) but i was able to turn off the air and set them free w/no harm done. overall, a great and entertaining toy for boys and girls of a wide age range!!",Positive,Negative,0.71057874
"i bought this toy in 2004 (is a little different than the newest model) for my baby and she loved it!  we kept it and now it's as much of a hit with her little sister. yes, the yellow piece can sometimes detach if it's intentionally pulled-off, but it's easily fixed and hasn't been an issue.  i can honestly say that this toy has been the most played-with item in our household with both of our children.  :)",Positive,Positive,0.049827836

"i bought this for my daughter because i found the commercials very amusing. the toy looked like a lot of fun. as soon as my daughter (9 months old) saw the box she started clapping and cooing (prob. because of the bright colors on the box). i put it together (pretty easily i might add) and we let the fun begin. my daugter and i played with it for nearly 2 hours. at first she didn't know what to think, the noise made her a little scared but once she saw the balls pop up and we started chasing them around the toy quickly became a favorite of hers. now she crawls up to it hits the plungers and looks at me and my husband like ok its time for the family to play.one word of caution, my daugter is in the ""pull up"" stage and she tried to pull up on the toy and we had to scramble to catch her, therefore, it is a toy that needs strict adult supervision, but it give the family an excuse to paly together. we love it !!!",Positive,Negative,0.5772091
"hard to know how to review this, but needed to say something...this is my son's favorite toy. in fact, he will play with very little else. he turns this on every morning by 6 am. he will make his way through a completely dark house to the front room to find this. the music is way too loud and it's insane. and i have to listen to it all day long. if he's awake, this thing is on. yes, the balls shoot all over. yes, this would be the toy the devil would make if he could make toys. but my son loves it. plus, he has learned how to fix it on his own when the balls get stuck in the tube, and it taught him how to put balls in a small hole, and he'll hunt all over the house for the ""right"" balls to fit in this, as he has learned that using the ""wrong"" balls messes it up. so it has taught him a bunch. but i still hate it. we buy him other ball-type toys in hopes that he will forget this, but he ignores them all. we once switched it off and told him it was broken or dead or something, but he pounded on it and screamed to the point where we worried he would hurt himself, so we swtiched it back on. if we put it away he hunts for it non-stop. fyi, my son is 13 months and has had this since he was about 7 months, and his fixation on it only gets stronger. he sort of likes the dino ball drop, but it's no ball popper.",Positive,Negative,0.7346653
"bought this in 2007 for christmas. 5 years later it is still working the same. sometimes the balls get stuck and need a little boost. usually when the batteries are extra fresh this is not a problem. my kid loved it when she was a little under a year old and still loves it to this day and she is almost 6. held up enough to pass down to my 16 month old who also loves it, especially when the balls fly out she loves going to get them and putting them back in music goes great with the action of the balls as well",Positive,Positive,0.009437796

"blowing up little plastic balls through a tube using a force of air and have them fall into a  ""funnel"" and down the chute only to be forced back up all over again.  how simple is that?  how engaging could this be?  the answer would amaze you,  it did me.i got this for my 13 month old and he loves it.  i love to watch him play with it.  i love to listen to him when he plays with it!  unfortunately, he cannot play with it alone.  it attracts everyone!  even the adults.  it's like the open bag of chips that makes all the hands appear!yes the balls go all over the floor.  that is the fun of this.  baby crawls and retrieves them.  i am so proud at how he brings them back to the toy.  sometimes he even pushes the toy to each ball on the floor.the top ""funnel-like"" fountain part does come off easily but it goes back on just as simply.  it is not a big effort to put it back on.now the mom scoop and what it does for me....i can get about 10 solid minutes of ""not chasing baby around time"" with this.  that makes it a winner!  when my older boys sit and do this with him, i can get more time.  sometimes enough to dust and vacuum the entire downstairs.  sometimes enough to dry my hair, or put the laundry away!  those of you with toddlers can appreciate the happiness that goes with starting a small task and completing it in one shot!the concept is simple, the balls are bright and colorful.  there is enough noise and activity to engage everyone for longer periods than i imagained.  this toy will not find its way into the toy box any time soon.  in fact, i am finding it in different rooms of my home as i carry it around with me when i need to baby to sit in the room with me for a couple of minutes here and there.i plan on giving this as gifts to my other mom friends who have not yet discovered this treasure!substantial toy even before you take into account the weight of the 4 d sized batteries it needs to operate.no problems with little hands getting stuck, i don't leave my little guys alone in rooms, maybe when their 21 i'll consider it...ha ha!great toy that will ""steal the spotlight""!rosemary",Positive,Positive,0.28959095

(note: if it gets too weak, you may have to block the airlow to build up pressure to get the balls started)  also, if the sound is really bothersome (doesn't bother us, but read reviews where it bothers others) you can remove the battery that does the sound.  can't remember which one it is, but you can find it by removing one at a time and pressing the plunger until the air works but it's silent.only downside to this is that our ball ramp doesn't lock into the bottom part securely, so we have to press it in pretty frequently.",Positive,Negative,0.9239444

"i bought this for my son when he was 4 months old at walmart for $9.99 and it came with another toy too.  he loved watching the balls go round and round and over the next few months, he learned to use it to pull himself up with (he has awesome balance, i wouldn't recommend that).  he also liked to take it apart and just feel the air blow on his face.  i'm sure this is a one time thing, but at about 7 months, he spit up down into the tube while he was playing with it ( he had bad reflux)  and i was able to clean it out easily with a damp rag threaded through the tube.  now, that's a durable toy!  over the months, the way he played with the ball popper changed.  he started predicting that a ball would pop out, so he put his hand over the hole and stopped it.  he would remove the balls quickly as they came down the chute.  at 19 months, he still enjoys playing with it, watching it, dragging it around, and interrupting the flow of the balls and replacing them.  this toy is a great buy and will last a very long time.update 2014: my second son played with it a lot as well.  it worked just as well and was just as engaging for him as for my first.  i took out the batteries and put it in the attic in a box of ""save for grandkids"" toys that are things i just can't part with.  maybe it won't work in 20-25 years, but i hope it does.  just like i wish my parents had kept that clown hat sprinkler that now sells for hundreds on ebay because it's so ""dangerous"" (we had a lot of fun!)",Positive,Negative,0.5213652

this toy is fun; it shows cause and effect and makes mom/dad run around the room scooping up the balls.  be prepared to have all the balls pop up and roll away from where you are sitting so by the end of the song there are no balls in the machine.  i keep a spatula/soup ladel with me when we play so that i can scoop the balls up as the machine goes.  it is a lot of fun and the older the kid gets they can chase the balls.  at 6 mo old our son enjoys pressing the button to start it and watching the balls pop up and then go back down the shoot.  it is fun and worth the money.,Positive,Negative,0.5075182
"we got this toy for my daughter for her first birthday.  she absolutely loved it from the beginning!  four months later, she still loves it!  she plays with it almost every day and learned how to press the button to get the balls to pop out the very first day she got it.the balls do tend to go all over the place though.. so we spend quite a lot of time chasing balls (but thats the fun of it i suppose, my daughter loves to chase the balls and put them back in the ball popper.and just a note i want to add:  if your child is afraid of the vacuum cleaner, then i wouldnt recommend this toy.  the motor is kinda loud.  my daughter has never had a problem with it, but it scared the living daylight out of another kid (who was about 15 months at the time) at a playdate!overall, very good toy.",Positive,Positive,0.12160767

we got this for my daughter for her first birthday.  she loves it.  the music is varied and plays a lot of different songs which is nice so it doesn't get too repetitive.  the balls do pop all over the place and my husband and i end up fetching the balls more often than not.  which is actually a pretty fun way to be involved with the game.  she likes watching the balls and trying to catch them and push them back down.i really recommend this toy.  it's a lot of fun!,Positive,Positive,0.04315574
"we ordered this toy as a gift from santa this year for our 8 month old son and he loves it as do we.  it was easy to put together & learn how to use.  the ""plunger"" to activate the toy is easy for a baby to use, even if by accident at first ... now our son is learning more ""cause-and-effect"" and figuring out that when he hits the plunger, the toy turns on.he laughs and laughs when it is on and i love that it shuts off after 30 seconds autmotically.  even when the balls aren's in it, my son loves to tilt the ball popper towards him and feel the wind blowing in his face and he laughs at that too!  my 6 yr old son also loves the toy and interacts so well with the baby when they play this together.my only ""negative"" comment is that the balls eventually pop all over the place and don't stay in the popper, so they are gone and i have to find them, pick them up & put them back into the toy in order for my 8 mos old to enjoy it again.  this gets ""old"" and the balls keep rolling underneath the furniture.  but, in all fairness, it states right on the box that the balls don't stay in the track of the toy all the time.huge thumbs up from me on this fun and innovative toy.",Positive,Positive,0.21628824
"if you're looking to make a hit with small children, you can't go wrong with this one.  adults fail to see the fun, but i've yet to meet a kid who isn't entertained by the ball popper.  the durability of this toy makes it worth the price.  every home with small kids should definitely have this one handy.",Positive,Positive,0.118614644

my son did not pay any attention to this toy for the first 6 months.  everytime he would try to play with it the tunnels for the balls would fall apart.  the fan is too powerfull.  it shoots the balls out of the toy and all over the place.  since the batteries have died down a bit and the balls don't fly out of the toy my son enjoys it.  he likes trying to catch the balls as they are rolling by.  i guess it depends on the child.,Positive,Negative,0.9493317

"my sister had this for her older daughter, so i had to get one for our little girl.  at first we weren't sure if she liked it or not, but then she started whining if we didn't push the plunger again fast enough (she doesn't quite have the leverage yet to push it herself).  she loves to watch the balls, experiments with what happens when she blocks it in certain places, pulls balls out....this is a very durable toy, so it is easy to find used, but it's worth it to buy new.  my niece played with it from 6 months through 3 years!the whole thing is pretty sturdy.  the only negative is, as a previous reviewer said, you spend a good amount of time retrieving balls, if your child isn't able to go get them herself.  but the fact that the balls sometimes go popping up and out unexpectedly is one of the most attractive things about this toy for the kids, and eventually she'll go get them herself.",Positive,Positive,0.15725698
"we got this for my son his first christmas and he loved it right away. he has gotten his hand stuck but it was easily removed with adult help. he also likes to block it up by putting small toys such as wooden trains down the tube. every friend he's had over to play has also loved it. my biggest problem with it is how quick it burns through batteries. it looses blowing power fairly quick and then you have to push the balls down the return end to get enough pressure for it to blow the other balls out the top. but given how much my son loves it, it's worth every penny in batteries and initial cost.",Positive,Positive,0.18801856

i bought this toy for my son's first birthday.  his eyes got real big the first time i turned it on.  he loves to grab at the balls and stop them from popping.  i like it because the sound effects are really neat...and the balls blow out at different heights. the only disadvantage is the top yellow part comes off easily when he leans on it as he's learning to stand.  but other than that - it's a great toy.  i know 4 other people that have it and love it!,Positive,Positive,0.015063358

"this is a good toy for a toddler, not a baby. i've used this toy in two different settings (first as a nanny and then as a mom) and both times, the babies were terrified of it. it's just too much stimulation for a 9 month old. the balls fly everywhere and you've got to run about after them to keep it going; unless of course, you've got a toddler, then they can run about after the balls (which seems to be half the fun for them). good toy, but not until maybe 14 months.",Positive,Positive,0.23240043
we bought this toy for my son's 1st birthday and he love it from day one. the tunes are cool and varied and the crazy poppin action is hilarious for my little one. its true to say that most of the time was spent chasing after balls and finding them in strange places. after 5 months he started to lose interest and was more fascinated with the hair dryer action you can do w/o the balls. i would imagine when hits 2 he might like this again.,Positive,Negative,0.584316

we bought this for our 1 yr old twin boys and they just loved playin with this toy and watching the balls shoot out. they were scared when we first turned it on from the fan blowing but they got over that quickly and just enjoyed watching it and grabbing the balls as they flew out.  we put it up after about 6 months to keep for our new baby that was on its way.  we recently got it back out as the new baby is now 7 months old and we thought he could sit and watch it.  of course the twins who are 2 couldnt wait to start playing with it again.  this is fine as the baby just watches them and tries to catch the balls when they fall on the ground.  the 2 yr olds love to catch the balls and put them back in the toy.  they also love to turn it sideways and let the air blow in their face or shoot themselves in the face.  when they shoot themselves they think it is so funny and cant stop laughing.,Positive,Positive,0.11281025
"my 9-month-old seems to like this toy alright...at first the loud noise that it makes scares her; but after a while, she got used to it and is now ok with it. this toy should come with extra balls, in case the original 5 get lost as they bounce around so much, most of the time they don't hit the plate...note: if there are not 5 balls in the queue it's not enough force to pop the rest...i think 4 d cell batteries is a lot for this toy...especially if your kid plays with it a lot..will need to replace the batteries really fast...but then again, it probably requires that many in order to force the balls to pop out...",Positive,Negative,0.8602829

"my son really likes putting the balls in and watching them go down the ramp into the tunnel, but he is a little wary/scared of the loud noise (kind of vaccum-like) when you actually turn it on.  it is a pretty neat toy though, and i think he will grow out of being scared of it (he is usually fine when i sit by him and reassure him...he is 11 months old).",Positive,Positive,0.18620948
"i must admit that when my mom gave this toy to my 12 month old, i didn't think it would be a hit - boy was i wrong!  both the baby and my 3 1/2 year old think the ball fountain is neat.with this toy you push the plunger, the music starts and the balls begin popping out of the top, rolling down the shoot and popping out the top again.  sometimes the balls just keep going through the circuit and sometimes they fly out of the toy and roll across the floor.  my daughters enjoy it all!from a parent point, the negatives are that the music is a little annoying and the five balls roll all over and need to be picked up again and again.  the positive is that it keeps my little ones engrossed.  the 3 1/2 year old can operate it all by herself and the 1 year old can play with it with only a little assistance from me (helping her corral loose balls and pushing the plunger).we haven't had any trouble with the sturdiness of the balls, but the yellow funnel does get knocked off occasionally.  it goes back on easily enough, but disrupts the play temporarily.bottom line is that we really like this toy and are happy to have it in our toy collection",Positive,Positive,0.17917855

"our 20 month old played with this at a friend's house and didn't want to put it away, which is not like her since she bores easily with most toys.  we purchased one for her and the moment she sets it down to play, her face lights up, she squeals with delight when she presses the big red ball to start the action, and then once the balls start popping in the air, she is overjoyed.the colorful balls are placed in the chute on top of the unit, then as they slide down the ramp, the air popper forces them up through the top hole and they pop around like popcorn!  we watch our daughter laugh and have a blast with this toy all the time, but she is learning so much from it as well.  first she learned cause and effect when pushing the red lever to start the machine.  she learned that the music will not start until the balls begin moving.  next she learned where to place the balls, and how to catch them if they scooted away, and finally she learned words like ball, stop, out, play, dance just from the repetition of the activities.  the fun music reminds me of a circus parade and several songs randomly play while the popper is activated.storage is a snap since it's heavy enough to stay upright while playing, and light enough to grab and go when it's time to clean up.  there are three main pieces that an adult has to screw together, and though a child might be able to pry off the top piece, it easily snaps back into place.  just don't lift it from the top piece and you shouldn't have a problem.i recommend this toy for babies who are able to sit up unassisted so that an adult can help them play with the balls, but highly recommend it for walking toddlers since they will love chasing after the balls.a+ from this parent on this one!",Positive,Positive,0.036750022

"i haven't found too many toys that my 1-year-old and 3-year-old can play with together -- mostly my preschooler tries to play with his toys, and the baby gets in his way -- but this toy is something they can both enjoy.my 1-year-old understands the point of this toy, and she's able to push down the plunger to get the toy started. when the balls pop out onto the floor, she knows how to pick them up and put them back in. but sometimes they get popping so fast and furious, she can't get to them quickly enough. that's when her older brother can run around and pick them all up.i can understand why some parents who had just a young baby didn't like the toy. there certainly would be times when a baby or toddler would not be able to collect all the balls and place them back onto the funnel. but that's what makes this toy perfect for our house -- it's challenging enough for my preschooler, but simple enough for the baby, too.some parents complained about the noise level of this toy, but i found it no more bothersome than any other electronic toy. it does have a fan that sounds roughly like a dustbuster mini-vacuum, but to me, that's just white noise.in the end, what matters most to me is that when this toy revs up, both my children smile and head that way.",Positive,Negative,0.73197436
"the busy ball popper is something of a rarity in today's toy market - it's unapologetic fun that makes very little attempt to teach anything at all.  as long as you understand what you're getting, then it's great.our son gets a kick out of watching the balls loop through the machine and into the air;  he gets an even bigger kick when the balls bounce wrong and rebound throughout the room.  it's a mini-workout chasing after them, but it's worth it to see him enjoy it so.i agree with other reviews that the unit could be easily tipped over, but the last time i checked, the easy solution to this problem is to supervise your child.  trust me - you'll have as much fun as he/she does watching the ball popper at work.  but again, this isn't suitable for any pull-up or lean-on activity.the fan motor that propels the balls is about as loud as a hair dryer on a low setting.  however, the music snippets make up for the white noise as they're better than most toys.  the balls themselves are very lightweight in order to allow them to travel;  as a result, they are likely too fragile for play beyond the ball popper.again, the busy ball popper is a lot of fun and does what it's intended to do very well.  it's not educational (get something leapfrog) and it's not a pull-up toy and it's not trying to be either.  if you go in understanding what you're getting, you won't be disappointed.",Positive,Negative,0.95114803
this toy is great for my 13 month old!  my son loves to try to catch the balls as the pop out of the top.  he also tries to push the balls down while the others are trying to pop out.  one downside to this toy is that the balls will pop out of the tube and bounce out of the top and onto the floor.  if my son already is holding a ball in each hand he wont go after the others on the floor so eventually there is no balls in the toy and i have to put them back in it.  but really this is a good toy to play alongside with your child.  it is fun to watch him frantically try to stop the balls from going back down the slide and into the tunnel.  a hint if you do buy it and the balls pop out all over the place: us batteries that are halfway dead!  the first batteries i put in this toy were dying and i did not have a problem with the balls going onto the floor because the air was not so forceful.  we have put this toy in a corner so usually the balls bounce on the wall and back onto the top of the toy.,Positive,Positive,0.3811078

this toy is awesome. it kept our kids even up to age 7 busy. the balls do not crush easily like if stepped on and you can turn the music off. the only thing i don't like about this toy is the fact that if your child decides to stuff something down the blower it may not come out without taking the toy apart. most things we were able to get out but some we had to undo the toy to get out. i would definitely get this again if we had another child.,Positive,Negative,0.80132025

"my son really loved this ball popper when we first got it. more than the actual popping of the balls, he seemed to love sticking anything that would fit into the chute. i constantly had to turn it over to clear it out. besides that, the only issue i have with it is that the force of the air pushing the balls up makes the balls fly all over the place. the only way to keep the cycle of balls going up the chute, dropping down and going through the whole thing again is if only two or three balls are used. one of them must be hovering above the air hole when another comes up to push it aside and fall down. in spite of all that, i think it was exciting for my son when all the balls we had in it would fly all over the place. just not fun for mommy to retrieve them!",Positive,Positive,0.3066561

"my son got this for his first birthday. he was a little afraid of it because it is noisy, but after a while he got used to it.  the balls do pop out of the toy and you have to chase them down, but it is fun anyway.  the balls are colorful and easy to find under couches.  :)  the plunger is easy for a kid to press.we used this for well over a year before stowing it away during a move.  we unearthed it a month ago for my second son to use (he's almost a year now) and although he doesn't actually play with the toy as intended, he does enjoy the balls popping all over the place and was not scared at all.my now four year old son does all the ball chasing for him, and it's a good way to keep them playing together and happy.  also, the batteries seem to last quite a reasonable while in this toy.",Positive,Positive,0.023463111

we bought this for our 8 month old and he likes to watch it.  but he would really rather pull it over and chew on it.  it doesn't really encourage independant play since the only thing for the child to do is push the button and then sit back and watch.  one downfall for it (although my son likes this part) is that the balls are constantly flying out and all over the room.  you'll find you spend most of the time picking up the balls.  but my husband and i are also entertained by this toy (sometimes i think my husband likes it more than my son!),Positive,Positive,0.11515921
"this is my son's absolute favorite toy.  if there is only one toy that you buy your child - this is the one!!!  we got it as a present when my son was only around 3 months old.  i immediately threw it in the back of the closet because it seemed too old for him at the time and quite frankly, too noisy.  i figured i would re-gift it for christmas.  i am so glad that i didnt get rid of it.  when my son was around 6 months i took the toy out and set it up and showed it to him.  immediately he started laughing at the balls and watching them go around.  as soon as he was able to stand he was pressing the plunger and making it go on his own.  now that he walks, he chases around after the balls when they fly out of the toy.  i am in a couple playgroups and the response from all the children ranging in ages from 6 months to almost 2 years is overwhelmingly positive.  i only wish they sold replacement balls seperately as i have yet to find any replacement balls that work properly in the toy!",Positive,Positive,0.41308534
"i have had this for over 2 years and for the price, it is one of the top toys in our house.  i originally wrote the review when i had a 2 yr old and a baby (both boys).  now i have a 2 and 4 year old. the music is loud and like another reviewer said, it sounds like a loud vacuum.  this is a go-to toy for both of my boys and for any visiting children.  i can't believe the use i've gotten out of this toy.  the only bad thing is that both of my boys at the age of 2 like to put other toys and items in the chute.  this creates a blockage and we have to stop everything to get it out.  usually isn't a problem.  i just turn it upside down and shake it out or turn it on for some extra pressure, turn it upside down and take off the top part of the ramp.  we've had a lot of other things down that chute and have been able to get it all out. and as for durability, we have carried it and dropped it and dropped it and dropped it and it's still working great.  if the balls stop coming out of the chute, it may be time to change batteries or just reduce the balls to 2 or 3 and you can get more use out of the batteries.  doesn't take as much power to shoot 2 or 3 balls out.",Positive,Positive,0.34174287
"dd received this gift around 1 yr of age.  i was concerned that she would be too old for the toy, however she's now almost 2 and still enjoys playing with it.pros:- music is fun, light-hearted and different than so many other toys out there- balls fly all over the room (you'll find this as a con also) allowing for child to chase the balls and anticipate where they will go- balls shoot into the air, which most baby's and children find amusing- it's easy for child to start (once they gain enough strength to do so).- easy to assemble- didn't eat batteries as quickly as i thought it would- doesn't seem like it would easily break, however dd is fairly gentle with her toyscons:- music is hard to hear over the fan- it tips over easily when dd tries to use it as leverage to stand up by- hand could get stuck down the hole- items other than ""balls"" are a challenge to remove from the hole- fan is definitely not strong enough nor the hole big enough to fit any of the fisher-price balls that are abundant in our house.  therefore we are constantly trying to remove them or keep them out of the way when dd plays with this toy.- we store toy in the toychest and balls fall out easily when not in use, therefore wish there was a way to keep them in the toy with some sort of cover ???  right now we end up emptying out the toy chest completely to find all the balls- balls fly all over the room (you will find this as a pro also), they get lost easily- younger children may have problems pushing the plunger down in order to start the toy- yellow slide is easily pulled off by child (and easily put back on by parent)i know i listed a lot of cons, but over all this toy has offered my dd many hours of enjoyment !",Positive,Positive,0.49899814

"we bought two of these 3 years ago.  while other floaties have come and gone, these have stood the test of time, going through 3 children!  we have never had to patch these floats, they fold into a nice small circle, and it's super quick to inflate them.  our second child was the only one who ever figured out how to climb out, but we were never out of arm's reach, so this didn't bother me.  our youngest is 2 this summer and she loves this float.  when she is not dead set on trying to swim, she kicks her feet and makes herself bob like a cork and it just makes her sooo happy.  i would definitely recommend these.  for the price, you're getting a superb product that will last more than a single summer.  if we lost ours tomorrow, i wouldn't hesitate to replace it!  hands down, this is the perfect float!",Positive,Positive,0.04874634
"this year my baby girl was old enough (16mths) to have some fun in the pool, so i spent considerable time doing research on a good pool float for her. after reading many positive reviews, i decided to order this one, and was very pleased with it. my daughter was able to splash in the water, and while she did try to crawl out of it a few times, that usually happend when she was tired of being in the water anyway. it was easy to inflate, and only took a few minutes of effort to deflate for storage. tip, practice a few times twisting it up to put away, it can be kinda tricky. overall, i would definitely recommend this product",Positive,Positive,0.110753156
"after reading the reviews, i couldn't possibly understand how a baby would, or could, climb out of this contraption while in the water...but folks, it's true!  mind you, i didn't allow that to happen but if they get enough weight on the front end, it'll hike up the back and they think they are getting out when they are only putting themselves in a bad situation and a face full of water.  not good.all things considered though, i do like this float but would recommend it's use with a few suggestions...1.  put baby into seat before getting into the water and especially if they wear swim shoes as they make it impossible to get the feet in the right holes.2.  after you get them in the float and in the water, you'll need to ""adjust"" the straps that go through and around the legs...i found that if i didn't make sure the straps were riding on the swim diaper, his legs were exposed to the straps being tight on his skin.3.  blow this sucker up as much as possible...do not under inflate or it will put a lot of water where it's not wanted.",Positive,Negative,0.95925254
we just went to the beach with our son and bought this at wal-greens for the same price.  i had read the reviews on here and decided that i wanted to try it.  our son is almost 7 months old so i can not say how it would do for a younger baby.  the age range listed does not recommend it for a younger baby either.  our son enjoyed this float and it was nice to be able to hold onto it and float with him.  it does put the baby more into the water than the typical inflatable baby float so you want to pay close attention to your baby of course. keep in mind what other reviewers have said about the baby's ability to lean forward in this float.  my son was able to get his face into the water at times but this float is recommended for an older baby and would give you the ability to get several months of use out of it.,Positive,Positive,0.19682677
"why i chose this specific float for my 5 month old (18lbs)canopy snaps in at seven points so it won't fly away. one snap in the back allows you to adjust the shade straight over the float or angled from the back.has two air filled rings so that if one pops and deflates, the other ring is safely holding the baby out of the water.very wide, large surface area. this keeps it from tipping over if your baby leans over.mine included a carrying bag with strap.fyi: if your baby is shorter than about 28 or 29 inches, they will probably dunk their face into the water. my 5 month old is almost 29 inches and when he looks down into his lap, his face is at the water level.",Positive,Positive,0.11222763
"i have two of these, this one and another like this but has a canopy. they are both excellent for my kids. i have used this for four of them in the pool starting around 6-9mo. that said, around 18mo, i have them graduate to wearable floating devices so they can move around freely.overall, this is very safe since it's impossible for the kids to tip this over. additionally, this has survived several years and four kids so i know it's durable.",Positive,Positive,0.0018461128
"i bought this item before my son was born.  my son is now 10 months old and he used it for the very first time last week.  i can not understand what the previous reviewers are talking about; water over the head? children climbing out? for children 6 yrs and older? some reviewers thought they didnt have to blow it up?? wha..? ???water over the head: you are in the pool, hello? my 10 mths old head didn't go below the water line.  the only way his head got wet was when i scooped water onto it.  at his last dr. appt he was 29"" long so maybe thats why he can't really put his face in the water unless he wants to.children climbing out:  your child is basically suspended inside a cloth/mesh seat.  simple physics wouldn't allow the child to climb out unless he had something to stand on and when floating in the water, what is there but water???  or unless of course the baby tries to take it off like a pair of pants.  i wonder.......or dives out of it? now would that be the manufacturers fault?6 yrs and older: i don't know which item that reviewer was talking about but i have the baby spring float package (which is directly from the manufacturer, correct?) in front of me and it clearly says on the back, upper right hand corner ""step 1-introduction.  ages 9 mos-2 years"".  i would love to see a 6 yr old fit into this thing.......and to the reviewers who thought they didnt have to blow this up: yes, this is a floatation device that uses air. it needs to be blown up.so anyhoo.........my son used it, he loved it. i felt safe with him in it.  he splashed around and looked like he could be in there all day long.  it allowed him to safely enjoy the water and i could enjoy it with him simply from watching him have a great time in it.  the inner tube he sits in can tilt a bit towards the front but the ingenious outer ring keeps the entire float very stable and keeps the inner ring from tipping too much into the water.  i saw some others babies in the pool using other type floats that tipped fully forward and that would certainly make me nervous. and because of the inner and outer tube being so narrow, blowing it up and setting it up takes less than 2 minutes. you don't need to completely make it absolutley flat for it to fit into the mesh bag.  i love the travel bag, too!!",Positive,Negative,0.6557876

"this is the second fisher-price infant to toddler swing we've used. the first one was inherited from a friend and lasted probably ten years in the alabama sun and humidity. the ropes were what eventually gave out. i think the ropes could probably be replaced, but at this price, it's much easier to just buy a new swing. our baby loves it, and he's very secure. we have no concerns about him falling out. it can be adjusted from a reclining to a seated position, and there are straps to hold the kid in place.when it first arrived, the ropes were not hanging evenly on both sides, and i thought i would have to return it. however, the rope is actually one piece that passes through the back of the swing. so, if yours arrives and it looks like the ropes are uneven, just give the shorter side a firm tug to even it out.",Positive,Negative,0.53801435

"i have to admit i thought they could have made more of an effort to have the ropes equal before shipping. when i got my swing, one side was about 2 feet and the other about 5 feet. i spent an hour trying to equal the ropes on both sides and finally gave up and put the swing back in the box. the next day i put both feet on the swing and pulled the short end of the rope with both hands and finally got the two back ends equal. once i did that, the swing hands beautifully. i don't think it can fall over backward, as i've read here, not if it's hanging properly. i also found the try very easy to release, just reach under the try on both sides and pull the plastic locking pieces so that they unlock and the try pops up so you can pull it up the rope and swing it away.. the swing itself is very sturdy, had a lot of room for baby or toddler and the harness is easy to snap together.. i hung the two attached hooks to an old chain i had already attached to a tree. i'm more worried about the old chain than i am about this swing. i can't believe the others are selling for so much money. this is sure as good as any i've seen and a lot less expensive. if it had come with the ropes a little more equal on both sides, i'd have given it five stars. personally, i don't get the negative comments, especially the security issues. unless there is something wrong with the swing and/or the ropes, i just don't see how it could tip over. i tried to see if i could get it to tip or twist (before putting baby in it) and i couldn't. the ropes in the back are shorter than the ropes in the front and the back of the chair is higher than the front, i just don't see how it could tip if it's locked into place in the back like it's suppose to be and the ropes are as shown. i'd recommend it, and i'm using it for my grandson.",Positive,Negative,0.67402554

this item is typical of fisher price - good construction and the boys love them.  i wanted to make a note of the handle to push the cars around with - great design.  if you are familiar with toddlers they push down hard and foward and it makes some vehicles difficult to roll.  the handle is perfect as it still allows the vehicle to move forward even though they are pushing down so hard.,Positive,Positive,0.10292368

this has become one of my favorite toys. my daughter just turned 1 and she adores it. it comes with the mother and a baby in a car seat as well as her stroller. the van has eyes which move when the wheels spin and you can honk the horn. it also palys the music to if you're happy and you know it.... when the horn is honked again. it does seem a bit loud but it plays for only a short time when pressed. my daughter can't fit them in properly yet but she gets them in the car and pushes it around anyway. i love this toy because it is one of the few for children her age that lets her use her imagination. i will be picking up the little people zoo or barn next since my daughter loves animals. this toy is durable and easy to clean. it can also be taken everywhere since it is a good size to carry along. the only thing that bothers me is that my daughter always throws the mom on the floor and plays with the baby. is she trying to tell me something ;-))??,Positive,Positive,0.013539553
"we purchased for dd when approx 1 yr of age.  at first she was only slightly interested in the car part and even less interested in the fact that it played music and that she could place people in the car. however in about a month, it became a favorite of her's.  we always bring along on trips to grandma & grandpa's as we know it's sure to occupy time and spur creativity.pros:- small enough & light enough for little ones to push around easily- play several catchy tunes such as london bridges and if you're happy and you know it, in addition to a few sounds (ie car noises, a horn honking)- hatch that opens in the back to place buggy (or wheel chair from the little people bus set) or to place/ remove people from car- large window and roof openings to place/ remove people from car- comes with a few ""people"" and can be used inter-changable with other little people sets- ""megablocks"" disney block buddies fit in the car seats also (we happen to have the piglet, pooh and tigger set)cons:- pink in color !  not very gender nuetral.- sometimes it's hard to place/ remove people from the car, as their arms get stuck in the window and roof openings.- depending on which people you try to place in the car, 2 people that have arms extended on each side of their bodies do not fit next to each other in the front seat, which frustrates dd.- music is slightly loud, however not to the point that i'm putting cotton in my ears :)overall this toy has gotten a lot of use in our family and i would definitely recommend it.",Positive,Positive,0.2507319

"we bought this swing to put on our swing set for our 10 month old.  he fits in it perfectly (he weighs about 25 lbs) and his 3 year old brother fits in it as well (but he is big enough for the regular swings).  the swing is the perfect height for a premade swing set.  at first i thought it was a little high, but then i figured out that it's high so that parents don't have to lean down to push.  i'm 5' 7"" and it's a great height for me.  but if you are trying to hang it from a tree, you will probably need extra rope.it swings level on the swingset.  the only thing i have noticed is the slouching problem, but it's not that bad with our son, just a little slouching.  he doesn't find it uncomfortable (in fact he has fallen asleep in it 2 times in 3 days).a great feature of this one is that the front plate swings underneath and snaps there for when you don't want to use it anymore!  i have so many things that i have to search for pieces for when i need it for another child...i just love self contained baby items!there are no problems getting him in and out of this one when he is awake or sleeping as the front plate swings out of the way.",Positive,Positive,0.08184724

(can see pic in customer picture area)  i bought some of the porch swing attachments and the swing rides very smooth!many people complained about the swing causing a slouch.  to me, this is the next step up from his infant swing which he's been used to reclining in.  he's very laid back and relaxed in this swing and really enjoys it.  he's just now one year old, so it's my belief that when he's older (2-3??) and wants to sit up more while swinging, we may have to get another type of swing because of the design on this one, but for now he loves it and seems very comfortable in it, so i can't complain.",Positive,Positive,0.043485407

"remember when little people toys were made of wood instead of plastic? weren't those cool? i still have my multi-floor garage. well today's little people are a lot more into detail and are as beautiful as ever.this particular one is great. your child will have as much fun playing with it as you will have fun teaching him about the story of noah. it's very educational and will stimulate the child's thinking cells. plus appreciate and learn about the bible, which isn't a bad thing especially these days.the ark opens in half showing the interior rooms which will accommodate all figures, and folds into noah's ark. the roof comes of too. it will not float in the tub though. but it has wheels, and when you push it around it makes wavelike movements. it includes some animals (giraffes, lions, zebras, toucans, all in pairs of course), mr. and mrs. noah (none of their children), a table and some ""food"" for the animals. i wish there were elephants but there aren't. there are two add-on packs for this set that include other animals such as pandas, peacocks, hippos, rhinos, etc. but no elephants :(this toy is very safe and colorful. are niece is in love with the toy. i am sure your little ones will love it too. and while you're at it, you can buy little people star wars edition for your big child... err husband. they are hard to find but are the coolest thing ever. my wife bought me... uh my niece some and they are awesome. i... my niece just loved them too. have fun!",Positive,Positive,0.09702635

"just wanted to say to any parent looking for a great outdoor climber this is the one you want.  it is small enough for little ones learning how to climb, but large enough to keep them happy for years to come.  cameron just loves his back yard climber.  he climbs up the wall (rock wall) and flips over into the ""fort"" and then it seems he is pretending to be on a pirate ship with the wheel and he acts like he is manning a ship, lol.  then he slides down the slide (which by the way is long enough to enjoy in a real length slide, not the tiny ones offered on some of the other sets)  and also rolls his trucks down the slide and then he gathers them and starts again.  he also loves climbing underneath to hide in the ""house"" which can also be used as a play area on top sand.  the colors are great, which isn't tacky in a back yard....i convinced my parents and some relatives to give him toys r us gift certificates so that he could get one nice item instead of  the little toys you end up throwing away!  this item took my husband only about 20 minutes to put together and cameron was off to his adventure.  we have had this since his birthday in october and he can't wait still to get outside to play.  it is very durable and worth every penny!  this helps your little one use his imagination and also gives them a work out, instead of being in front of a t.v.  thanks for offering another great item!  we love you step 2 and toys r us !!",Positive,Positive,0.011394734

(...)  the climber is easy, easy, easy to put together!!!  15 mins. tops.  its very durable, as its had 5 children on it at once at our sons birthday party. the only problem is that we had planned on using the bottom as a sand box but our son is way too tall to sit up comfortably under it and play in the sand, so i was a little disappointed over this reason.  i would suggest if you are buying this for your child that the age limit would be 3 and under if you are planning on using it with the sandbox under neath and the slide is not as big as my sons swing set that he got for his 2nd birthday.  but the slide is fun for our son, its safe and would be great this summer to put a kiddie pool at the bottom for him to splash into.  this is a great climber for active kids and is made to last.  the added wheel at the top of the climber in the playhouse part is a great feature and i love the climbing walls.  our son loves to crawl under the bottom of the climber and we use the bottom to store some of his outdoor toys like his bubble mower and things like that.  the sandbox that you can buy to match for this item looks big enough for a 3 year old, so we will probaly buy that to go with this climber.  if you are thinking of a climber this is the best one for its money in my opinion.",Positive,Positive,0.011803467

"we received this as a birth gift for our son, who is now one year old. it was wonderful watching him grow with this chair. at first, it was a snuggly hammock where he spent some of his more restless naps and nights. the vibrating feature was great for calming him, and we could rock the chair to help him get to sleep, then leave him safely buckled in.what was superior about this chair, as compared with the typical bouncy seat, is that when the kickstand is up, it is not on as steep an incline. this means it can be used by younger infants, even when they aren't great at holding their heads up. with bouncy seats, their heads tend to flop over.eventually he began batting at and grabbing the toys on the toy bar, which helped keep the chair interesting enough that he'd remain calm while i took a shower, checked e-mail, etc. this chair was one of those priceless items we would pack up and take with us when we travelled so he'd have a familiar place to hang out, wherever we were.so for those first 6 months, this chair was definitely a winner. but since he's gotten more active, he is not content to sit there for long at all, and when he tries to sit forward, it does appear that the chair might tip over (though it never has). the one remaining thing i find useful about it is that it's a good place to buckle him in when i need to trim his fingernails. it keeps him still if i put the kickstand up.i'm not getting rid of it yet. i am hoping that when he reaches an age that he's willing to sit still at all, this chair will be a place he enjoys. (my sister-in-law has the same chair and said her 4-year-old still enjoys it.)",Positive,Positive,0.19425806
"i love this rocker! this is the first thing i bought while i was pregnant and i'm glad i did. it's the first thing my baby used after i brought him home. it is so easily transportable (it's light) that i can put it in any room and have my son with me so i can watch over him.there is a bar that extends out if you don't want it to rock. this allows the baby in a laying down position. it also vibrates, which soothe my baby to sleep.if i want it to rock, i fold the little bar and it rocks. it has a little cloth seat support that can be buckled in so the baby doesn't fall off while it's rocking.the toy bar is awesome, though i didn't need it until my son was old enough to focus on things. the toy bar is easy to remove and put back on. the toys are colorful and my son enjoys them very much.i highly recommend this rocker!",Positive,Positive,0.20398101
"as another reviewer said, this item was useful from day 1 at home.  as a newborn, our son would take long naps in the cradle position.  in a few weeks, he began to enjoy the rocker position and began to rock himself when on a hard floor.  (this was especially helpful when fixing bottles, etc.) then he began to kick the ball.  his interest only declined when he could sit up on his own, but now that he's had months of practice sitting up, he's starting to show interest in the rocker again.  (in the meantime it was part of the bedtime routine as we placed a favorite stuffed animal in it to go to sleep each night.)one warning (especially for first time parents):  like other sleeping situations, make sure that your newborn's head doesn't lean to the same side every times he naps. his head shape can be affected.",Positive,Positive,0.39189067

"we bought this rocker/vibrating chair for our 3 mo old son after pondering over which bouncer to buy for him. most of the bouncers are hardly as versatile compared to this product. the mutliple recline positions are helpful for when our son wants to either sleep or sit and &quot;vibrate&quot; and rock and watch everything happening around him, including the tv. the only problems are; 1. the seat could have been more padded rather than a cloth covered board on his bottom. 2. the on/off switch for the vibrating mode can be easily turned &quot;on&quot; by accident and uses up the battery power without your knowledge. 3. after some time when using the vibrating mode, it makes the screws (holding the chair together) loose and makes a loud, annoying &quot;buzzing&quot; sound and then the structure of the entire chair can feel a little loose. 4. the velcro straps holding the toys on the toybar are too small and the toys tend to fall off on their own. otherwise, since these complaints are minor, the chair does a much better job than a standard bouncer. i even considered the new baby papasan chair, but it did not nearly have as many options and was not as versatile as this chair, plus this product was almost half the price of the papasan chair. we are happy with this choice.",Positive,Negative,0.93376434
"grandma bought this bath time toy for my daughters, a preschooler and a toddler.  they are avid dora the explorer fans.  i prefer this bath time toy to the floating island adventure set, which we also own.  both dora and boots are large and easy to handle.  my daughter can easily remove and put on dora's flippers.  the bright yellow design on her life jacket changes to orange when immersed in the bath water.  while boots does not have any removable parts, his inner tube has a hole in one side.  i had fun surprising my daughters with this squirting monkey.  i can squeeze excess water from the inner tube to dry it out after the bath to prevent mildew build up.",Positive,Negative,0.9657341

"my daughter got this at age 21 months and she loves it.  dora stands by herself when her flippers are on.  the great thing about this dora doll is, you can't mess up her hair, and she can get wet because of her plastic body.  her vest changes color, not boots (as described on this website).  boots is made of soft plastic and squirts water, which makes him fun.  my little girl loves to carry them around!",Positive,Positive,0.34382084

"i grabbed this up while it was on sale for my daughter.  this is a version without the color change vest, so no comment on that.  as for dora, there haven't been any problems with her head filling with water at all, she's dries off pretty easily.  my daughter has a lot of fun bathing dora and washing her up!  she really adores this and it is the first bath toy i have boughten her that she actually plays with.  she's had boats, ducks, little mermaid and strawberry shortcake squeakies before, but she only ever liked playing with cups and a washclothe and bubbles.  so i'm thrilled i finally found a toy she likes!as for the twins in their floatie, she doesn't pay any attention to them, but as i said, she's pretty picky.  they float okay about half the time, the other half they flip over because of the weight of their heads, which isn't balanced.all in all though, for $6 and change, this was well worth the price for the fun she's getting out of it!",Positive,Negative,0.976656
this is a great toy for any dora lovers. i purchased this one along with splash along with dora and boots. both are big hits with my twins. they have other dora dolls but for some reason really love these and play with these everywhere. they love taking them into the tub but also love to feed and put them to bed.,Positive,Positive,0.29550767

"i would agree with the other mom that said this is the mother of all kitchens!  it is just like the real thing.  it has all the appliances of a real kitchen plus all of the extras.  all the sounds are very realistic and she loves making everything work.  she loves that she has plate holders just like mommy!  she also loves the baskets because they hold all of her play food.  this thing holds all of her play kitchen items and then some.  i have never seen so much storage on a kitchen set.it is a very large unit but it was well worth it the extra space!  it is so realistic and the ""granite"" and other details make it a really nice toy to have taking up part of the family room.  plus it is super easy to clean and unlike another set we had it is very stable and sturdy...good enough (and large enough) for 3 active toddlers to all play with at the same time.all in all mother of all of kitchens is a good description of this set.  it's great and you can't go work with it!",Positive,Positive,0.0036905012
"i was very tempted to by the lifestyle dream kitchen.. but at the last moment, i decided to buy the lifestyle deluxe kitchen for my daughter.. and i am so glad i did!  best decision ever!good things about this kitchen:-  the storage!  this kitchen has so much storage!-  its big.  many children can play at this kitchen no problem and still have a blast with it.-  its durable!  its not cheaply made at all.. its very well made.-  it comes with the lifestyle pots & pans!  my daughter loves these pots and pans.. and so i was very pleased to see that this kitchen came with it so i didnt have to buy them separately.things to note:-  i wish the sounds boxes (there are three.. microwave one, stove one, and a dishwasher one) lasted longer.  the sounds last for about 2 seconds.. and then they are done.  they are realistic sounds nevertheless, but they should last longer in my opinion.-  the decor is kinda lame.. they should update their stickers!-  i wish the sprayer on the sink reached out longer.  it only comes out about 6 inches (if that).. and its hard to ""wash"" the dishes on the other side of the sink.-  takes about 1.5 hrs to set up.. and you need two people to do it.but overall, my daughter absolutely loves this kitchen.  highly recommended to spend a little bit more on this kitchen.",Positive,Positive,0.04241302
"we love this kitchen, but it is not perfect. yes, it has it all. sink, dishwasher, microwave, fridge, oven and stove. it has a nice starter dishes set and foods to begin with. we didn't buy more dishes, but we bought more food to go along with this kitchen. i give it 4 stars because some of the doors don't close well, drawers fall out easily or get stuck and there is very little counter space. huge sink but not enough counter space. the dials for the appliances look more like telephone than the appropriate dials, and they make very soft noices. i don't agree with lound toys, but this is really soft. the telephone is cute, but it is also too soft. it is the best kitchen i've found and yes we love it, but it could be better hence the four stars.",Positive,Positive,0.07172793
"i just bought this for my 4 year old and 1 year old daughters.  last christmas i bought the disney princess kitchen and spent $60, the year before that i bought the little tikes tender heart kitchen and spent $40 - both of them are garbage.  they break easily and weren't worth the money.  i figured if i wanted to get something nice for the both of them you're better off spending a little more.  just a note though, if you buy direct you get free shipping on this until 12/31 and it's still in stock for christmas.  i will let you know how it is when i receive it next week...i can't wait to play with it!!update 12/12/05 -we ordered this last wednesday, and it came on friday.  it took us a long time to put it together about 2 1/2 hours.  put the stickers on before you try to assemble it, you'll be glad you did.  i think this was worth the money.  my only complaints - the sounds are not very realistic at all, and the cupboard doors are poorly made and don't fit as nicely as they should.  but the shipping time was excellent, plus i got free shipping which made it even better.  i looked at the regular one at toys r us, and that one would be fine if you only have 1 child.  with the deluxe one there is plenty of room for 2 or 3 kids to play together.  there is extra storage space, counter space, and the dishwasher.  for an extra $50, you're better off with the deluxe kitchen.update 12/27huge hit - the girls loved it,  we kept this in the kitchen.  they opened all the presents and their stockings and then we surprised them in the kitchen with this.  they were estatic!! it has been more of a hit with our 1 year old than our 4 year old, only because she was busy with all her other toys.  the look on their faces was worth every penny.",Positive,Negative,0.5965901

"while we have several of these wooden puzzles, this appears to be the one they didn't think through.  it's a wonderfully constructed book but easily dismantled.  my 2 year old can remove all the magnetic pieces but rarely puts them back.  and like another reviewer it must be used under complete supervision.  unlike the ""noisy"" puzzles that my son will not leave alone.  they are wonderful toys but this one really should have some improvement to it since the age range is really wrong for it.  i love it, don't get me wrong but it does need some re-thinking since it is a product that young children can take apart and with small pieces there is a choking hazard.  or at least a chance that they will get stuffed into little mouths unless properly supervised.",Positive,Positive,0.13917923
"we have had this magnetic abc book for a year now. we take it out to look at together every few weeks or so. the pieces are all intact and the book is fairly entertaining. my 2-year-old likes to take all of the pieces out, one by one, and then he will name the pictures as he puts them back in the correct positions. in my opinion, the illustrations are just ok, but then, that's not really the point of this product.my 2-year-old book fanatic will sit and ""read"" his books for 45 minutes at a time, several times a week. this is not one of his favorites, but every so often, he seems to enjoy it. it's something different anyway. i like the ""hands-on"" approach this book provides.this would make a great car or plane trip toy, provided that you bring a carry case for all of the pieces. this is quiet, educational, somewhat engaging and requires no batteries.",Positive,Positive,0.037706867

"great puzzle. i set up a station of different types of puzzles and art stations for a three year old birthday. it went over great with parents and kids...this one is a little tougher than others and helps build fine motor skills.that said. you have to put it away every time. if you slack off, you will end up with these pieces everywhere. of course, it is easy to use even with a few missing pieces and easy to just add them back to the set as you find them.",Positive,Positive,0.05937607
"i bought this super young and tried introducing it a few times along the way, but this time it's a huge hit. 3 1/2 was the magic number. he's into naming shapes right now and being able to match them up on the pattern is pretty fun. not as fun as launching a full on helicopter dinosaur fire rescue mind you, but still engaging enough to play on his own for a little while. durable for sure, really needs to come with a better lid for all the dang pieces, but what can you do?  go buy a dang dollar tote and get over it i guess. also, as a math mom, you might as well introduce the proper names for the shapes now while you can. if you're really into it you can talk about angles and tessalation later. their geometry teacher will thank you later.",Positive,Positive,0.08653773

"i purchased this for my 2 1/2 year old to use while i teach my older children.  she loves this and it is not too difficult, which was a concern for me.  the box, boards and pieces are all-wood construction and appear to be very sturdy and durable in construction.  the negative aspects for me were 1) the container is open--no lid.  if you don't have a shelf to put it on, then i wouldn't suggest it.  2) the boards fit snugly into their compartment which makes removal very difficult.  you have to turn the entire case upside down to get all of the boards out.  there is a piece of plastic that is somewhat rigid that comes with the packaging that i have retained to use to cover the half with the pieces as i flip over the container to remove the boards.  an additional note, the two sides are not identical in size, so put the boards in first before you proceed with the pieces or your child will be frustrated with the amount of time that clean-up takes.  also, there are plenty of the pieces, so i would imagine that at least 3 children could play with one set at a time.",Positive,Positive,0.34358132
"i've seen a few reviews mention that the picture boards that come with this set are useless but i disagree.  what i like about this set, which comes with half a dozen double-sided ""pictures"" to guide your tangram designs as well as probably about 100 of the small wooden pieces, is that you can make your own patterns on a table or create pictures with the boards.  my 3.5-year-old's skills have improved through use of this toy - he has become very good at carefully placing the pieces onto the boards to complete the pattern, and he's learning shapes along the way.  i would recommend this toy, which is an excellent educational, quiet alternative to so many young children's toys out there now.",Positive,Positive,0.27835214

a big hit in a day of play for a child. so many designs to chose from that they can identify with. they learn colors and shapes in a fun way. they stay focused for a long period of time and learn to be gentle. in my daycare these blocks are played with over and over. they find it easy to clean up after playing because it's so orderly. a wonderful way to learn!,Positive,Positive,0.07649056

"i bought this for my daughter when she was 3.  she's now close to 5.  she gets easily frusterated with this toy since the pieces do slide around easily.  it seems like that is a common complaint with this toy.  i don't really think it's that big of a big deal.  things in life aren't always going to stay exactly how you put them.  the only time my daughter plays with this is when i'm sitting with her playing.  she usually ends up wanting me to put the pieces on the board for her.  so we make it a game where she needs to find the piece i need and tell me the color and shape of it.  my 2.5 yr old also participates. or we sort the shapes or count how many of each shape there is.  so i guess the bottom line is don't buy this toy if you don't want your child to have any frustration in life.  if you can over look the fact that the pieces do slide around easily, then this is a great toy.  i do wish it came with a decent cover or lid though!",Positive,Negative,0.579157

"preschools have similar pattern blocks and pattern sheet sets, but those are usually thin plastic.  this is nice painted wood pattern boards and sturdy wooden shapes.the pieces are small, so definitely keep away from toddlers/infants.  the largest piece is the yellow hexagons and those are about 2"" diameter (corner to corner). the smallest is the elongated white diamonds which are about 2"" long and only 1/2"" across.the pattern boards are flat, so the pieces are not going to fit into slots or indents.  that means building the pictures requires a steady hand which may frustrate some children but provides a nice challenge for those not easily frustrated.the 5 boards are double sided; the 10 pictures are:a sun/flower pattern (top right in main amazon photo)a bird (we think)a butterfly (lower right in main amazon photo)a puppy/wolf cuba snaila tug boata flower in a flowerpota rabbit (lower left in main amazon photo)a train enginea fishone of my only complaints with mellisa and doug toys (which i love, btw) hold true with this toy:  they come with incomplete storage solutions.  this has a nice divided tray but no lid!  all those little pieces and no lid--even if you store it flat, if it gets bumped, they are everywhere!  we keep the pieces in a cloth bag i had around--so you can come up with a solution, but really how hard would it have been to include a lid?  these are for little kids after all!  this is why i rated 4 stars on durable, because you won't be able to make the pictures if you loose the pieces!overall a nice sturdy set.",Positive,Positive,0.016151896

"my son received this toy over three years ago.  i must admit the pattern blocks & boards wasn't a favorite, as it caused frustration.  i'd help him pull the boards out of the box, and i'd place some of the tiles close by, so he wouldn't have to reach into the box.  william would match the colors, yet he had difficulty with the tiles sliding on the boards.  he became so aggravated i put the toy away.the next time the toy came out, i put the boards up, and we started sorting the tiles.  we'd discuss the colors, the shapes, and counted the tiles.  we also started combining the tiles to make our own designs.  in time, he adjusted to the boards, and became quite good at reproducing the patterns.  now that he's 6, he likes the pattern blocks & boards.since we have many melissa & doug sets, i like that the lid is clear, so kids can identify the toy.  i wish the box had a groove on the board side so it would be easy to grasp, and remove the boards from the box.  it's a tight fit, and i have noticed william turning the entire contents out on the table, or floor because he struggles with removing the boards.  as it's completely made from wood, this set is very durable.  overall, the pattern blocks & boards is a well-made, educational toy.",Positive,Positive,0.026086023

"my eighteen-month-old loves this toy.  i carried it with us to the doctor's office last week and it kept her happily occupied for a good 30 minutes.  she enjoyed stacking the pegs and putting them in the holes.  she also liked playing with the crepe rubber puzzle pieces.  she's still a little young for puzzle skills, but she'll be there soon.  in addition to the obvious, here are a few other things you can do with the toy:*use the animal pieces for mini puppet shows*use the pegs for patterning or comparing (which stack is taller?  how can we make them the same?)*play a memory game. put out the pieces and ask your child to cover his eyes while you remove a piece, then ask him to tell you what's missing.*talk about shape, colors, numbers, etc.lauri also says that they will replace lost or missing pieces.  that's a great bonus, especially for a toy meant to be carried with you.the one negative--and the reason i'm giving this toy four instead of five stars--is that the box is made out of cardboard with a velcro closure.  that's not going to last, especially if your toddler likes taking the toys out and putting them back in the box.  i'm going to put everything in a fabric drawstring bag.  if you want a quiet non-electronic toy to pull out for doctor's visits, traveling, restaurants, etc., this is a good toy.  just know that you'll probably want a different method of storage.",Positive,Positive,0.06722265

"when santa delivered this toy my boys were almost 3 yrs & just turned 5 yrs. after careful reviews this was one of two bruder trucks we purchased. the truck, because of its size, colors, and because it really works, was and is super cool to my guys. they both love it and play with it equally. will it break? it may at some time, nothing in this world is lasting, it's plastic, and played with by boys. there are no obvious plastic pieces that stick out and look as if they'd be the first to break. however, i took the time to show my boys what parts could break and how that might happen. they can sometimes be rough boys, and they carry it around the house and up and down flights of stairs, but they love their trucks. however, days go by where they didn't even touch the truck, which surprised me. then one day i dumped a bag of dried white beans into a kitchen pan of mine, placed the pan on the floor in the playroom, and showed the boys how the beans could be turned into the barrel of the mixer, or cranked out, while the beans pour out of the chute as concrete would. i have to be creative during our long wi winters. this the boys fell in love with. this changed everything. now every day the beans and concrete mixer are taken out and played with. when summer comes, i'm not too sure i like the idea of sand in the truck, any type of dried legumes, beans, or corn kernals seems preferable. as for the educational factor, we barrow library books and dvds about concrete mixers & learn the proper names of its parts, how one has to drive slower and use even greater care when driving such large equipment. the boys love it. i'm pretty frugal, and a lot of thought and research goes into each gift my children receive. this will be played with for a few years, and i am happy (with the addition of the beans) how much they play with it. it is a great purchase i recommend.update- almost 3 years have gone by since i've purchased this toy, it's still very special to my boys, it's still one of the first toys played with by visiting friends, and still in perfect condition.",Positive,Positive,0.36144617

"love the the toy .  the hook on the crane is heavy metal and works very well to hook onto things. it also anchors the string well and keeps it from flopping aroundi was worried about the cord getting tangled but the way it is threaded through the toy will prevent that from happeningall the knobs that operate the moving parts are bright red - was easy for my little guy to figure out how everything works by himself. they all make cranking noises when the knobs are turnedthe only thing that was a small drawback is that there is a gray arm that moves up and down.  it has a rubber part running down the middle, (like a rubber band) and it does not move up and down smoothly.  sometimes i have to turn the knob pretty hard.  also i am worried about how the toy will work if the rubber band ever breaks.",Positive,Positive,0.11767522
"this is a terrific toy (especially for a boy). my husband and i enjoy playing with this as well. granted it is pricey, but we gave this to our 3 year old as a main gift for his birthday, and it was a hit",Positive,Positive,0.005183036
"nice large child's toy.  my 4 year old loved it as a present from santa.  like other bruder toys, it is all plastic and susceptible to breaking. we will be leaving this toy inside to hopefully increase its longevity.  we already have the cement mixer, bulldozer, and front end loader.",Positive,Positive,0.07688391
the only reason i did not give this a 5 star rating is because it needs to come with some accessories for the hook (maybe a cargo net or a clamp).  outside of that it is very well built crane that works well and it will last for a long time.  my son loves it and would recommend it.,Positive,Positive,0.40516666
"with a 2 year old who loves crane trucks, we have purchased a few. this one is, by far, the best quality and most durable one we have. i was a little nervous about how it would hold up over time, but we've had it for about a year now and it is still in great shape. bruder products are expensive, but they are far superior to most of the other trucks you can get at toys r us and the like. if you're shopping for a crane truck, this is the one to buy.",Positive,Positive,0.01961598
"this toy has a lot going on.  there are three pails and a ball that can be nested, stacked upside down or played with seperately.  the largest pail (which is heavy and can hurt if thrown) is clear with water inside and sea creatures that move.  an octopus is molded into the blue plastic underside.  this pail also has a rubber handle that can be chewed on like a teether.  a blue pail has a sea star at the bottom and the pail rattles.  it has two small holes in the bottom for water to stream out from.  the smallest pail is yellow with a hermit crab attached to the bottom.  the crab can be turned and makes a clicking sound.  the red ball has a fish inside that will spin when the ball is moved.overall, this has been a fun toy for my son.  i wish that the sea star and crab that are at the bottom of two pails were more accesible for him.  he looks at the crab, but his pudgy hands can't get down there to turn it.  he does like the colors and creatures and they keep him entertained for up to 30 minutes at a time.",Positive,Negative,0.7478436

"my son (5 months) received this toy from the easter bunny rather than chocolate and he is really enjoying it.the large bucket has water in the sides (like a snow globe) which he finds fascinating.  the other two smaller buckets have different textures and things to look at as well.  the small flutter ball as a fish inside that spins.you can stack them inside each other or turn them upside down to make a tower.  at the moment, he just enjoys knocking down the tower and holding the buckets as he learns to hold things.as with all fisher price they are extremely durable - stand up to being knocked over and dribbled on (just give them a quick wash!) and i love the fact they are the lovely pale colours rather than the usual bright red, blue, green and yellow that most baby toys are.recommended.",Positive,Positive,0.0041787857

"i received this toy as a shower gift.  my daughter enjoyed the ball and stacking the buckets, but she kept fiddling with the little attachments on the bucket, thinking something would happen.  this toy would've gotten a higher rating from me if it had.all in all a cute toy.  the larger bucket is heavy, but that wouldn't discourage me from buying it.",Positive,Negative,0.9526411
"these are really cute toys.  my daughter has even seen them in the store and tried to play with them.  she understood right away that she could make things happen when she pushed the buttons on top.  she likes to stack them too.  she is pretty rough on her toys, and so are her friends.  i really think they are cute, and she has a lot of fun with them.  great buy.",Positive,Positive,0.045154285
"i bought these for my 16-month old son for christmas (from amazon for $10 with free shipping) and i only wish i had found them sooner.  it's really easy to stack the blocks because they have the button on top and a concave bottom.  i must have mis-read the description because i expected them to light up, but they don't.  when you push the button on top, one side of the block moves.  when you stack the blocks, it pushes all of the buttons so all of the moving parts move.  another side has a flap that you either move side-to-side, up and down, or twist depending on the block.  the other 2 sides of the blocks have a, b, c and 1, 2, 3.i read one review that said these were smaller than expected so i expected them to be pretty small, but because of that review, they are bigger than i expected and the perfect size for my son to pick up with one hand.  i would guess that they are about 3 inches on each side.i definitely recommend these blocks.",Positive,Negative,0.668646
"i bought these blocks for my son when he was approx. 7mo old.  he loved these things till close to his second birthday, although he lost interest a lot quicker than he did when he was younger. these blocks are super sturdy, they are a great buy for a child younger than one year.",Positive,Positive,0.004857178

i bought this and my grandson loves it. his little hands ca hold them easily.,Positive,Positive,0.0013957316
"these blocks are cute and have several different things the baby can do with them.  they stack easily on one another and do not stick in anyway, easily coming apart or being knocked over.  they are hard though and if your new walker/crawler falls on them it can cause minor injury (bruises, chipped teeth).  they are small enough to pack into a diaper bag and carry with you though!",Positive,Negative,0.70389014
"my little guy loves to have these blocks stacked only to knock them down. he loves the ""action"" of these blocks. the blocks are easy to handle for his little hands. he holds them and chews on them and loves to scatter them around the room. it is nice gift for a baby and they are not loud or annoying.",Positive,Positive,0.002025558
"i really like these blocks. they are the perfect size to grasp onto and are great since they have a lot of other uses. the sides of the blocks have many different activities for baby to play with so it doesn't get boring for children of small ages. great toy for the money, i would totally recommended this to other parents.",Positive,Positive,0.107587524
"we got these when my son was 10 months old and he instantly took to them. they each have a different spinning part which is activated when pushing on the top of the block. they also have open and close 'doors' that proved amusing for a bit. i found them great to pop in the diaper bag (small enough not to take up much room) and i'd take them out one by one as my son tired of the one he was playing with. they kept him interested and quiet for a good bit while at church or some other meeting that required quiet, so that makes them very worthwhile in my book!",Positive,Positive,0.058580287
"these blocks offer more in the way of entertainment than they do actual block building.  they have pretty cool little cause/affect educational benefits, but they're not the best set if you're looking for actual building blocks.  if you're wanting toys that just happen to also be stackable, this is a cute toy and my son has gotten some enjoyment out of them.  if you're wanting an actual block set, get a block set.",Positive,Negative,0.53542846
"it's a pretty cool toy. you stack them up, press the head on top, and all these spinning things start spinning and it makes a noises. i really love this toy. but my baby? not so much. it's hard for her to push down and isn't really being marketed to the proper age group. i would recommend this for a two year old, if you have a two year old in to these things. my six and four year olds were never into baby toys. they went straight to dolls. so if you have a two year old into this sort of thing, go for it. otherwise it's really just something to amuse mom and dad.",Positive,Negative,0.8656577
"my 10 month old grandson was actually difficult to buy toys for this past christmas. he's too old for teethers and fabric blocks that don't do anything, but too young for hammering or stacking blocks. this set was perfect for him. he can hold them on his own and flip the little doors or push the top buttons. he will play with these for 20-30 mins at a time - which is a lot for a 10 month old! i've even seen him try to stack them up himself. i'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it for those ""inbetween"" (not infant, not toddler) babies!",Positive,Negative,0.546805
durable blocks seem to keep my little one's attention for at least a little while. he got excited when he learned the little people control the movement on one side.,Positive,Positive,0.06940511
these blocks are fun and entertaining.  i like how each block is different and can all be stacked together so that one of the little heads can be pushed down and make them all do something.  my 8 month old doesn't seem to understand the different features on these blocks yet and won't play with them together by himself.  he will pick one up to chew on.  these blocks appear to be very durable.,Positive,Negative,0.64139324
these are great blocks for a slightly older toddler.  there is a lot to do and can keep my daughter busy for some time.  i think she got them a little too early (18 months) when she really needed softer ones so she wasn't a fan initially but she's come around now (20 months) and loves to play with them,Positive,Positive,0.017003607

"i paid something $7 at a discount store that rhymes with ""doll-part"" and i loved these.  they were great, they endured from the time my son was a baby to a toddler and held up quite well.  they stack and are full of action.  each piece moves independently, or when stacked they all move together when sufficient force is applied to the top block.  hours of fun.  but it can be found much less expensively elsewhere than the $19.99 i see they are charging today + shipping.  i think that is overpriced for three blocks.",Positive,Negative,0.61865544

"my son (5 months) received these as an easter present and they've been a favourite ever since.  they are great for tummy play and he manages to bang the top of the blocks where the head is to make the spinning things go around.  he loves it.  he loves it when we do it for him too.  the blocks can be stacked and when you hit the top on, all the spinning things move around. there are lots of great colourful things to look at, touch and feel and manipulate.  they are great for little fingers that are learning to do things.  easy to keep clean when dribbled on and small enough to take with you when you go out.  will keep baby entertained for ages!recommended.",Positive,Positive,0.0049582156

"my daughter, who will be one next week, loves these blocks.  each one does something different, and she seems fascinated by the bright colors and spinning.  i stack 'em up and she knocks them down.  my only issue is that they're very hard to clean.  they have stickers and crevices and weird areas where goo seems to collect.  she's teething, so tries to chew on them, which has resulted in the goo.  other than that, they're a lot of fun.",Positive,Positive,0.43375677
"i was surprised to see all the different kinds of activities on these little blocks. they are smaller than i expected, but each side has something interesting to touch, move, push. they don't stack very well, but when they are stacked, they interact. if you stack them and push the head on the top block, all three blocks have spinning sides that respond. but my baby just doesn't seem interested in them when he's alone with them. he likes when we play together with them, but it never goes to it on his own.",Positive,Negative,0.7833302
"~the red ""b/2"" block is one of his favorite toys (while the ""a/1"" block is simply ok and the ""c/3"" block is kind of lame).~as far as independent play goes, the only part of the blocks that are worth anything are the spinning parts.~but, i believe the spinny parts are still good for building fine motor skills during independent play time.~and the spinny side is the only thing neat about these blocks... the other 3 sides of the blocks are pretty lame... i think fp could have done better.~ when help him play with them (like stack all three together) he's amazed that all three blocks spin together.~so overall, worth it i think.... but then again, i paid a dollar for them at a garage sale",Positive,Negative,0.6947721

these paints have good color for washable paints. there is a bit of an odor when wet that i do not like. i am not sure if it is harmful and it goes away when it is dry. check the size bottles when shopping for the best price so you know what your getting. i ordered singles and a three pack and the three pack was smaller bottles. i had not paid much attention! happy painting child in my house... momma happy it cleans up off the wood floors...even when it has dried.,Positive,Positive,0.007821393
"pros:- quality paint, vibrant colors, not thin or transparent- washable- great price per ouncecons:- need different containers use paint out of.- if you buy a bunch of colors, storing the bottles of paint starts to take up spacei was looking for inexpensive paint so my kids could go hog wild painting anytime they wanted without breaking the bank. my girls would burned through typical paint sets in no time. this fit the bill. i bought 10 different colors of crayola artista ii paint. you get a lot paint for your money with these 16oz jars, but you need to buy something to store the point in that is kid friendly. you're not going to be able to dip you paint brush in these paint containers. if you just squirt some on a palate, then you will end up through a lot of paint away after each painting session. you also lose a lot of paint if you rinse out a single brush between colors. my solution was to buy 10 paint cups and 10 paint brushes one for each color. it works great; my little girls have fun and don't have to worry about running out of paint.for paint containers and paint brushes i bought- chenille kraft no-spill round paint cups- chenille kraft preschool paint brush assortmenti like the bushes; a lot of brushes with good variety of styles and widths.i'm not a fan of the paint cups. they work alright, but they don't seal very well so the paint may dry out over time. see my review on the product page: http://www.amazon.com/chenille-kraft-no-spill-round-assortment/dp/b000jl54ii/ref=sr_1_3?ie=utf8&s;=toys-and-games&qid;=1280030345&sr;=8-3",Positive,Positive,0.092982315

"while i've been discovering how chalks are not created equal, neither are chalkboard surfaces. this is actually perfect to chalk your board with. it's inexpensive and if you have a large board(like i do), and a few smaller ones(like i do), then this is the perfect choice because you will go through a lot of it. chalking your board makes it easier to erase any chalk. just wash(i use dawn dish soap but any household cleaner will work unless it's wall paint) your board and rinse thoroughly and dry. once your board is completely dry, take your chalk side ways and start drawing in wide strokes, covering your whole board completely. then take a dry cloth and rub/wipe the chalk into your board with a cloth. i use my sham-wow's that i've cut into smaller pieces. you will end up with chalky look, but it will be easy to wipe off any chalk. i know, you will lose the pretty and clean look, but if you rub it good enough, it will still look good. i've learned the hard way to do this with all my boards from the very expensive porcelain chalkboard to the cheapie easels. it works wonders. guess you could just wash it every time you are done, but i don't have time for that and this way the kids don't get frustrated. i only wash if the boards get gunked up.if you really want a silky and dust free chalk to write with, get the rikagaku dustless chalk. it's a bit pricey, but you won't regret it.",Positive,Negative,0.7711268
"it's a pretty good quality chalk. leaves clear, white marks when used properly that are pretty sharp overall. works the best on a blackboard, not so great on other surfaces. easily erasable. not as &#34;dust-free&#34; as the advertising might suggest, but definitely much better than the most. depending on your use a single box may last you a few days to few months.the chalk was not shipped as quickly as my other amazon prime purchases. a couple of chalks were broken when i got them.",Positive,Negative,0.5940539

we use these around our house for rainy days or bored faces.  we use them for face painting.  you just dip the pencil tip into water for about 30 seconds and there you have it.  draw away!  the best part is that they clean up so easy.  much better than face paint.,Positive,Positive,0.021562722

"well it says it is for 3 - 5 year olds, but my (nearly) two year old has great fun with this. it can be used of course like a traditional telephone and as such is ideal for make-belive telephone conversations with grandmothers etc. but it is also a fun electronic toy, expecially for little ones who like elmo, as the keys can be made to play numbers or sounds and words associated with the pictures. the sound could perhaps be a little louder, but having said that, perhaps this is a blessing for parents with headaches! on a more serious note, the child is holding the 'phone to their ear, so this could be a very wise health precaution. all in all, a good quality additional to the toy box.",Positive,Positive,0.17592719

i bought this phone because every day when i went to pick my son up from day care he was playing with it. i thought it was really cute and i put it in his stocking for christmas. we do not have a problem with the volume and after reading the one star reviews it seems as though there was just a bad batch that went out. save your receipt and return it next time people...it's really not that complicated. and it doesn't warrant a 1 star review.,Positive,Negative,0.9974796

"this is a neat little toy. i would rate it as a high three, low four however.first, if you are looking for toys that you can play with that encourage more than just pushing a button and encourage learning you may like this toy. however, i would not say this is a toy and it is not something you can turn over to your kids and expect them to get a lot out of it without your input. but it can be interesting to use and fun as a family type toy.some of the things you might want to be aware of before purchasing.this seems very light and has the feel of being quite fragile. we have had ours for some time now and it has not broken though. the ""meteor maker"" that comes with this is simply a little flashlight with a covering to make different shapes of light on the room where you watch your stars. this is a loose piece and not very big and thus easily lost. it also doesn't do a good job. the 'meteor maker' is not the bonus they advertise it to be on their box. second, it takes a little bit of effort to set it to the exact day and time for your area. not impossible but not something a child will do on their own. also, this does not seem to project well on very large rooms. we had no problem in the bathroom projecting the stars on the ceiling. the names of the stars do not project and if they do they are not legible. we were able to do it in my son's room but it was a little bit more blurry.although this can be educational, i think it is more interesting than really educational. we would have a hard time looking at this in our bathroom and then going out to the night sky and finding some constellation we were able to find in the night sky. if you want to use this to find some of the constellations and tell the stories about them to your kids, this might be a good place to begin.overall:if you are going to do something interesting with your kid and you have the time to set it up so you can see the night sky the way it's going to look tonight; this is a fascinating little toy. but remember, it really isn't a toy and it really isn't going to be fun for your kid if you just hand it to him and expect him (or her) to be able to set it up to look like it would tonight and operate it with no input from you. if you look at it more like you are using this to spark an interest, encourage an interest, explore something new- then this is a great piece of equipment.",Positive,Negative,0.674258
"i love that these spouts fit the avent bottles (i had to bottle-supplement for 2 weeks, but never used the bottles again, i hated to wasted them like that.)  you can buy just the spouts for about $4 for 2 and just pop them on the avent bottles you already own--4 or 9 oz.  it's a beautiful idea.  i find that 4 oz is just right for meals and 7-9 oz is good for outings.as for leaking, i realized that if you put the spout together and then put the whole thing in the ring, it's hard to get the spout and ring to seal properly.  so i put the rubber spout in the ring, then push the valve in and that pretty much fixed that.  i don't get leaks from the spout, but occasionally  (mostly with milk for some reason) it leaks from under the ring.  but on the positive side of that, it keeps me from letting her tote her juice and milk all over the house all day long (a bad habit in my opinion) but it's okay with the water.in talking to moms with babies very attached to their bottle, they thought this helped wean them because it still looks like the bottle for the most part.",Positive,Negative,0.89536667

"we saw wedgits in the toy bin of a friend's toddler, and when we asked, our friend was so excited to show us this toy. ""it's the best toy ever,"" he said. then we watched him and his two-year-old assemble a fantastic tower together, take it down, build something else, and so on. we were sold.(we bought this item, the normal wedgit set, instead of the baby-safe one which has none of the smallest pieces. we simply took away the smallest pieces before putting it out for our 18-month-old, and when they're not a choking hazard anymore, we'll add them back in.)so why are wedgits the best toy? you'd have to ask a child to get the real answer, but good luck distracting them from the toy long enough to ask. basically, wedgits are an angled-stacking-toy instead of a flat-stacking-toy like building blocks. this gives them a little more stability, but also much more flexibility. you can build towers with peep-holes in the middle, weird branching structures, whatever you want.once our toddler got the hang of the fact that same-colors don't stack on each other, he's been in love with this toy. sometimes i come around a corner and find a pyramid or a tower in the middle of the floor. sometimes i go into the playroom and see him surrounded by a scattering of wedgits as he destroys one construction to start the next....and when our son's asleep, we play with the wedgits too.",Positive,Positive,0.10822045

"after seeing the gushing reviews here on amazon, we decided to get this &#34;toy&#34; for our almost 8-year-old. he's expressed interest in learning about electricity and how electronics worked, so i thought we would try this. in a word, he has loved it (and we have too)!cost: we bought this on amazon for roughly two-thirds of the price found in some retail stores. and, as usual with amazon, it arrived quickly and in great condition.durability: there are many small electronic components, so this is not something that younger children can get into. resisters, switches, diodes, a small motor, and integrated circuits are mounted on small, hard plastic pieces. if not cared for properly, these pieces could break. needless to say, we don't let his younger siblings near the confines while this is out on the table.the pieces snap together onto a plastic board, much like snaps on a coat or jacket work. i think that with a great amount of force, items might break, but as i already mentioned, with good care, this should last a long time -- several years, maybe even for the grandkids.educational: this is a fantastic educational kit. it starts slow with simple series circuits -- creating a light, making a motor turn, making sounds, and quickly gets more complicated. what i like about it is that you don't just build one item and go onto the next item. for example, one project has you build a &#34;space&#34; alarm. the next &#34;project&#34; then calls for you to adjust the circuit slightly and watch what happens to the noise, volume level, indicator light, etc. it helps you identify why certain things change as the circuit changes, thus giving the builder a better idea of how the electronics on the toy works.fun level: very cool to watch what the circuit does once it is completed. we've only done about 20-25 of the projects listed so far, but it has sparked imagination about what is possible.recommendation: definitely worth it for kids in 2nd grade and above. any child that has demonstrated interest in why things work or how things work would probably enjoy this set.",Positive,Negative,0.68159246

"anyone with even the slightest electronic background will appreciate the value of this toy.  as a kid i remember the long frustrating hours of deciphering components from circuit diagrams and soldering them to create projects that were way too much effort. the limited success with these projects, i believe, is the reason i gave up my hobby.as a parent of a six-year old, i have been trying to introduce him to all facets of science and this is a wonderful tool. he immediately created a circuit - a combination light/fan circuit - in parallel and in serial - and he understood the difference between them. it was just amazing. he always appreciates what we get him, but he fell in love with this toy instantly. he was engrossed for the next hour experimenting with the various components.there are about 60 components which create a total of 300 projects. count on there being about 125-150 basic projects (i have not conducted a detail count!) with the remaining coming from tweaks in these 125-150 basic projects. however, i do not want to discount the value of these tweaks...they are designed to teach the value of electronic components and instigate independent thinking. this is definitely a ""learning"" toy. with the limited emphasis on science in our schools, the approx. [item price] is worth the investment.for people who cannot envision how these snap into place (i couldn't!), the ""snap"" is from ""snap-button"". the component is soldered onto a large piece of plastic which have snap-buttons on it. these snap-buttons snap onto a large plastic grid or onto other components. simple concept - snap-on and snap-off!!all the components have their respective symbols stamped on them which aids in early familiarization. the pieces are also individually numbered so that there is no confusion in identifying the right component. the manual is all-color and very easy to follow, however, some might prefer more detailed explanations.the model i purchased was ""snap circuit 300 with computer interface"" an upgrade to the one available here. the interface package includes software and a cable which connects to the ""line-in"" jack of your pc. the other end of the cable has two alligator-clips which can connect to any two points in your circuit. the software turns your pc into an ""oscilloscope"" so that you can ""see"" the electrical activity between any two points in your circuit. i have yet to fully learn and appreciate the value of the oscilloscope.for teenagers, there is a snap circuit 500. i believe it features more components and more complex circuits for about [item price].warning: please read up on basic electricity and explain the principles to your child. my son connected the positive and negative poles of the power supply for only 5-7 seconds - the battery heated up and popped into his hand. did not burn, but taught a valuable lesson - to me!! i should have taken the time to explain basic electricity to him. those 2 aa batteries really heated up!!if you are going to buy only one toy this year - you just found it!",Positive,Positive,0.24877691

"one of my kids received this as 5th birthday gift. the age on the package is 8-108, so i wasn't sure she'd be ready for it. as it turns out--she loves building the projects and is building an understanding of how electronics work.this deluxekit comes with almost everything you need to build over 300 projects. (you will have to supply your own aaa batteries and the kit needs 4.)there are a lot of warnings with this kit, so if your child is on the younger side, prepare to be involved. do not touch the motor or fan during operation, do not connect to electrical outlets in your home (shock hazard), don't create short circuits, don't leave a project on and unattended...and there are the dreaded batteries!the snap circuits are so easy to use that my 5-year-old has no problems snapping the circuits together. where we can run into issues are with the reading of the project diagrams (she is only 5, after all). if a component is placed on the board upside down, you might not be able to complete the circuit correctly. however, the pieces are easy enough to snap on and snap off.  the project diagrams are pretty easy to follow. they show the layout of the circuit, placement on the board, and the order in which to stack the pieces. each project lists an objective, an explanation of what should happen when you turn the switch on, and any changes you should see when you make adjustments to the circuit. if there are any special warnings, like not to touch the spinning motor, those will be listed, too.one of our favorite projects is the dc motor & switch project. it shows how electricity is used to run a direct current (dc) motor. the circuit is a very simple design and you attach a plastic fan to the top of the motor. the motor spins so fast that the fan flies up into the air like a &#34;flying saucer&#34;.  another project, the lamp & fan in series, adds an led to the circuit. the light, which turns on at the same time as the fan, will prevent the motor from getting the full voltage. the fan will spin, but will not fly into the air. while not really understanding the details, the kids did notice that the fan spins faster in one project than the other.there are a variety of other projects including games, burglar alarms, night lights, and more.the projects only take a few minutes to complete. the more complicated projects can take a little longer because they have more pieces. depending on the purpose of the project, you might play with it for only a few minutes (slide the switch to make a sound) or longer (the flying saucer because it's fun).  this seems like a perfect rainy day activity. and with over 300 projects, you can make projects for hours...",Positive,Positive,0.3599155
"i regret buying this product, really i have to accept that it is the best toy i've bought my daughter in my life, that very well designed, well documented, well supported, functional, fun and my daughter will not let go from for weeks, it is entirely educational and its value is very low, after this experience i regret buying the sc-300, i should have bought the snap circuits sc-750 extreme. now i'll have to buy the upgrade kit, the battlery eliminator and all the products this company sells! the best electronic learning kit that can exist.",Positive,Positive,0.42322603
"i was concerned that all of my grandson's toys seemed to be centered around conflicts of super heroes, all good against evil. i don't like the bad guys pictures prominently displayed on the boxes of toys that are currently popular with seven-year-olds. so i found this lego-related item. i was impressed by the 558 positive reviews. i prayed, hoping that my grandson would like it.he loves it. he and his sister (9, our granddaughter) were up at the crack of dawn. without parental or grand-parental assistance,they were whipping through some of the 300 possible projects, totally enthralled.so i recommend it heartily to everyone.by the way, i disagree with the reviewer who said he wished he had brushed up on basic electronic principles to make the construction process into a real teaching experience. the reason i disagree is that is one of the wonders of the toy. kids can create amazing things on their own. i just don't want anyone to think that you have to know your electronics before getting this and giving it to someone. the kids can figure it out (and are learning in the process).",Positive,Positive,0.38196066

"what parent today doesn't lament that they just don't make toys like they used to? toys break prematurely, they underdeliver on their promise of fun, and they simply don't engage kids like the stuff we grew up with.not snap circuits!i ordered this for my six-year-old son and we've loved every second of playing with this educational toy.what makes it stand out?1. exceptionally good building instruction manuals. with clear directions in full-color, the two large manuals included with the sc-300 kit are perhaps the best manuals i've seen for anything i've ever purchased. they lay out all the projects possible with the kit and also the principles that govern how the projects work.2. rugged construction pieces. the electronics of the kit come attached to thick slabs of plastic which have spring-loaded button-snap connectors (as found on clothing) on the backside. each piece is clearly marked, especially so for those electronics that attach in one specific current direction. the kit should last for a long time.3. clever construction system. the button-snap connectors are pure genius. most of us parents know the electronic kits with spring terminals, but the snap system here outshines the kind we grew up with.4. three hundred projects in the sc-300 kit. plenty of projects to keep the kids occupied on rainy summer days. i wish i'd had a kit this nice as a kid!5. good mix of electronics. a nice range of resistors, capacitors, ics, and special function electronics, including photo sensors, speakers, sound sensors, motors, microphones, etc.6. superb value. rarely can you buy a children's toy and get the feeling you truly received what you paid for. this kit's worth every dime--and then some.about the only negative in this kit comes from knowing larger, even more complex snap circuit kits exist! you can never buy one large enough.in short, if you've got a child interested in electronics, consider this a must-have. and even if your child's not showing that interest yet, this kit might be all they need to discover their inner electrical engineer.my son and i love snap circuits. you will, too.",Positive,Positive,0.30087373

"our five-year old son received this as a christmas gift last year.  after a year of use, he still enjoys playing with it.  all of the parts and the board itself are well constructed from heavy-duty plastic.the board, which acts as the base for all the electrical designs, has several &#34;pegs&#34; on it which all the electrical circuits snap onto.  the board has an alphanumeric grid which corresponds to the layout of the circuits in the user's manual.  the user looks at the manual, grabs the necessary component, and snaps it into place on the board.  when two or more components stack on top of each other, the directions indicate if the component is on level one, two, three, etc.  this tells the user that all components on level one should be placed on the board first, those labeled two placed second, and so on.  it's a very ingenious way of telling the user how to construct the circuit.  the pictures are very clear and well laid out.once the circuit has been built, i'll read the explanation to my son so he knows what to expect when he turns the switch on.  likewise, i tell him what each piece is and point to it as i'm reading the description to him; resistors, led lights, speakers, etc.  he's learning more about electricity and circuits than i ever did at his age and up until college.the circuit board operates on two aa batteries for most designs.  the remaining circuits use four aa batteries.  we opted for the ac adapter to save on buying batteries.  but, at one year later, have hardly used the adapter.  i probably wouldn't buy it if i had to do all over again.  with all the batteries we buy for other toys we've always got an ample stock in the house.  the adapter was just another expense we probably didn't need.  that being said, it does work well and we have had no problems with it.kids who like to create and build things with their hands, such as legos & trio blocks, should enjoy the snap circuits sc-300.  this does not require any tools whatsoever.",Positive,Negative,0.52043545
"this is a fantastic kit.  i love the design of the product overall.  it makes creating circuits very easy to demonstrate or do.the main drawback of this kit is that once you go beyond the switches, lights, diodes, resistors and capacitors... it's mostly based on ic's.  unfortunately, the ic's are too abstract for younger children.  the ""alarm"" ""space wars"" and ""music"" ic are basically black boxes.  and there are no relays or transformers in this kit.  i don't think there's a potentiometer either.  i would prefer that the kit include more basic principles of electricity, and less ic gimmicks.  as it is, i'll probably end up adding my own components.  besides what i mentioned, a multi-meter would be a great companion to this kit as well.",Positive,Negative,0.5677802
i bought this kit for my 8 year old son for christmas.  i was wondering if it was going to be too complex or if he would be interested.  i expected that he would think it was cool at first but quickly lose interest.  i am glad to report that he loves this kit and builds stuff daily.  he is able to follow the circuit directions on his own and only asks for help when he gets stuck or when he wants me to invent a new circuit.  as an electrical engineer i find it really cool to modify the circuits by adding a variable resistor here or the variable capacitor there to show how those changeable elements can make the circuits interactive.  i will definitely be purchasing other add-on kits to go along with this kit so we can continue to make more complex projects together.,Positive,Positive,0.08010535

"the sc-300 kit, with its over 60 parts and 300 documented projects could be viewed as the entry-level option of a series that include general purpose models sc-500 (75 parts, 500 projects), sc-750 (80 parts, 750 projects) and special kits such as model scrov-10 that would involve the building of a remote control snap rover.snap circuits stimulates a child's curiosity and understanding of electricity and electronics as well as the child's creativity.it would be difficult to overstate how impressed i am with this set but that won't mean much because i'm a grownup. the good thing is that my 2 boys, 12 and 13 found it interesting too. they've been building 'devices' shortly after opening the box and, a few projects later, they were already building their own variations and seeking explanations of 'why' certain changes worked while others didn't. i am not sure about including 8 or 9 yr. olds in the recommended age range but, by the time they are 11-12, most kids should be naturally curious about what is it that makes electronics work the way they do and this kit helps them to begin to understand what it is that's making our increasingly intelligent machines act the way they do.contentsthe kit includes a large number of electronic components: wires, switches, lamps, diodes, resistors, transistors, capacitors, motor, microphone, special purpose integrated circuits.the plastic base grid simulates a printed circuit board in that it allows the components to snap in place making it easy for the schematics presented in the manuals to look exactly as illustrated.the 2 manuals ""projects 1-101"" and ""projects 102-305"" complete the kit.operation and educational valueeach of the two manuals includes brief tutorials on how to use and how to troubleshoot a project. they also provide brief descriptions of each of the parts, explaining how they work. the do's and don'ts section should be read by both parents and children before beginning, especially the section on short circuits and what one should never do.once the children have a basic understanding of 'circuits' and what they should not do if they are to prevent destroying some of the parts, they are ready to begin and begin they will.each individual project, usually presented on half page includes:- project number, name and objective.- a colorful schematic showing exactly the parts to be used and exactly where on the base grid they should be placed.- a couple of paragraphs of text explaining how to proceed with assembly, what to expect and, more importantly why.projects range from the simplest circuit - battery, lamp and switch - to building logic gates and transistor radios.children will not learn physics and will not be able to fix tvs after completing these projects but this practice, hopefully combined with the help of a grownup, they will gain some understanding of 'why' and 'how' some of our gadgets perform some of their functions. if their curiosity is stimulated to the degree that they seek to learn and understand more, this kit should be viewed as a good investment.my own experience showed the kids almost immediately thinking of variations to the projects the book was instructing them to build - replacing the light bulb with a motor or the 'whistler' to see what happens or, once they understood how 'circuits' worked, trying to build and test 'parallel' circuits on their own.my ratingeverything is right with this kit and i can't think of anything wrong, really. we are not through with all 300 projects yet but the first 50 generated at least twice as many variations. for the money, it can't get much better than this.it's 5 stars without reservations except for the suggested age group. except maybe for the genius sons and daughters of electronic engineers, i would say that 10 and older is more realistic than 'over 8'.",Positive,Positive,0.27427927

"this is a very nice seat and my 12 months old has been on it since he was 2 1/2 months (at this age he no longer fitted in his infant seat). he always semed confortable and never cried while on it. so i highly recomend it. but if you have a very large baby like i do and live in a state that has cold winters then you may run into the problem i just did. my 12 month old is now 33 inches tall and 30 lbs. so he reached the limit on the height for this, his head is just about 1 1/2 inch bellow the top. but the real problem is that now that is is very cold out, he could not fit into the seat with a heavy jacket on. the straps are not long enough to snap in place and give him a little room. and yes, i made sure that i had it pulled all the way out. that is why i give this item 4 stars. otherwise, it was great. so for an average baby, you can probably use this seat until she/he is at least 2 or 3.",Positive,Negative,0.5379783
"i relized this week that my infant carseat was just about coming to an end. in a panick i started to go all over the internet looking at different convertible seats. i ended up at consumer reports and saw this seat. it received an excellent rating in the crash test department which impressed me but seeing the seat in person is what sealed the deal.this carseat is awesome. the shape is slightly curved giving your child a better fit than a straight chair. its much more comfortable and cushiony than the other seats. but its so easy to tighten and loosen the straps! i love it!i had a graco travel system and tightening or loosening the straps was tedious and annoying. this has a latch or a knob on the sides of the seat and you either push the latch or turn the knob, thats it! adjusting the height of the straps is a little bothersome but you wont be doing it too often so its really not that big a deal. plus this has a memory to the straps so when you take your baby out of the seat they ""give"" a little to make it easier and then go back to the tension they were at...brilliant!there is absolutely no assembly to this seat, just take it out of the box and put it in your car.this has 5 different reclining posistions which are easy to change with a big button on the front of the seat. the seat installed easily in our jeep, we dont have the latch system in our car so we used the seatbelts and its fine.the cover comes off so you can wash it when it becomes messy, very important.the weight goes up to 40 pounds in the front facing posistion, so you will get a lot of use out of it.safe, easy and attractive.",Positive,Negative,0.72556025
"we purchased this seat at target for 15% less, in a fabric called aztec, which is a very attractive option. it's a great seat.our 20 lb 7 month old loves it--we know because he falls asleep the minute we hit the road, something he never did in his old seat. he also loves the cushioned buckle--we know because he has stopped trying to unbuckle himself since we got this seat.we love the memory harness, the easy to use release levers and tightening knobs, and the one-hand recline lever. the best part is being able to change the height positioning straps from the front--so easy you can do it in less than 3 minutes, by yourself.this seat is safe--just ask consumer reports, whose experts rated it among the top 3 seats in their most recent review.",Positive,Positive,0.22701423

"i have spent about 2 hours researching on the internet for which convertible car seat was the safest, simplest, most comfortable and affordable for our 5 month old baby girl, who still needs to be rear-facing for another 7 months. her former carseat (eddie bauer travel system w/base) was making us crazy because to have the handle down, it required the passenger side seat to be scooted up to where your knees were practically in your chest in our '98 corolla.  we couldn't imagine doing that for another 3-6 months.  so, we started looking. i was disappointed first of all to discover the last study consumer reports did on car seats was june 2001. so much has changed since then and their top picks (fisher price) are no longer on the market. so, i read a ton of parent reviews and tried to use what was left on the june consumer report. i narrowed down the choices to the triump 5, the graco comfortsport & the ever-popular britax roundabout.  we tried out the first two in the store. the triumph 5 immediately caught my eye because of it's comfort factor and shape. when we put her in it, she seemed happy and as if she was in a recliner.  the comfortsport seemed less padded, more boxy and bigger (although it is lighter). we also chose the triumph seat because of the knobs on the side of the seat that adjust the straps (instead of buried against the seat).  it's so easy to make adjustments. also, i like the fact that it has 5 reclining positions. i took the new seat to a car safety check yesterday and the officers and volunteers were very impressed with the design, features (especially the knobs on the side) and one told me that it was in the same class as the britax (but of course [$$$] less!).  also, with the seat rear-facing and in the middle of the backseat, both driver and passenger seats are able to go back to almost their maximum setting! no more knees in the dashboard!",Positive,Negative,0.8726574
"i have read the other reviews on this car seat and i have to give it 5 stars and here is why; i purchased this car seat for my 5 month, 21 lb son (no, he doesn't eat big macs) ha. i am impressed as my main concern was fitting a car seat into my compact 4 door sentra. i did not want a large and bulky car seat as i have had problems with other car seats getting in the way of the front seat driver or passenger seats. the adjustable strap mechanism is a very nice bonus and it is easy to use. the cushion is nice and ""plushy"" for my  baby and he appears very cozy in the reclining position. the inside straps underneath the padding are easy to get to compared to most car seats and i am not concerned with my child trying to ""rip out the foam"". this car seat is a perfect size, even for compact cars, there is no separate base to worry about and the new tether attachment is simple and easy rather than the seatbelt attachment (2003 models and newer?) i also like the appearance of the rear fo the car seat in the rear facing position. i have a 5 year old daughter and i have never had problems with escape artists trying to unbuckle themselves in my car; except for my girlfriend's 11 month old daughter was successful in unbuckling her infant car seat. escapr artists come in all shapes and sizes, we parents must closely observe our children, even when we think that they are behaving. i would recommend a baby seat mirror in your vehicle, especially for a rear facing positioned car seat so that you can catch your little escape artist. this is a very nice car seat overall, but i am not impressed with evenflo's customer service. i had a problem with a stroller that i purchased less than 90 days prior, but since the date of manufacture on the stroller was over 3 years ago, evenflo would not fix the problem with the stroller. i suppose that is why they call it a limited warranty. take care!",Positive,Positive,0.091196805

"i get this puzzle for all of my friends with little ones. it is a great way to learn colors. most items show a color with something, then another color with a new object. that makes it difficult for the child to learn the color, because a lot has changed between the items. here they are the same - all whimsical fish. the only difference is the color. this makes learning colors so easy. my child had them down by about 18 months with this puzzle and i 100% recommend it to any parent. it's a fun and easy puzzle but also a great learning tool.",Positive,Positive,0.0017512442
"it's a basic puzzle.... but the kids have fun matching it up and figuring out how to get the pieces to fit.  it was certainly easy enough for them to figure out what goes where so they didn't get frustrated and give up (thinking they were putting the wrong piece in) which was a problem i had with other puzzles.  this has been one of the best puzzles we've had, but admittedly, my kids don't usually love puzzles and give up relatively quickly if it gets too hard/boring.  they got this when my oldest was 3 (now almost 6) and it's still out at least once a week.",Positive,Positive,0.06140839
"my daughter got this puzzle for her second birthday and it has been such a hit.one of the great things about this puzzle is that all of the pieces are the same shape, so the child can put any piece in any of the holes.  my daughter would sometimes match the colors up (pink to pink, etc.) and sometimes she would ""mix it all up"" (pink in the black, etc.) because of these variations, the puzzle has provided hours of entertainment for her.melissa and doug products are durable and wonderful!",Positive,Positive,0.004828998

"after reading some of the negative reviews here about the paint being stuck together on this toy, i decided to look for it in a local store to avoid possible return hassles.  ours is perfectly made, so no worries there.  i like this stacker for my 16 month old son for a number of reasons.  the post is the same diameter all the way down, so the rings can go on in any order now when he is first learning to stack.  but for later, the angle of the rings is pretty gradual, so when he's able to start determining the right order it will be a little bit of a challenge.  and classic wood toys are just nice in every way-- versatile, and nice to touch, hear and look at.i wouldn't buy this for a sitting/crawling baby, and i would definitely not leave it on the floor near a new walker.  the post seems too poke-y to be near a child who isn't steady with his body.  even with my son, who's secure on his feet now, it's a table toy.  the rings are small and numerous enough that it seems more suited to a more advanced stage-- a child who walks well and has good hand control.  someone said they thought the smallest ring was a choking hazard-- not really.  it's about the size of one of those hostess mini donuts, so unless your kid is extremely motivated, has a very large mouth, and is left unsupervised long enough to perform such feats of anatomical interest, you don't need to worry about choking.",Positive,Positive,0.42237782
"maybe i just lucked out at got a good one (compared to the others who complained of the chipped paint), but for the six dollar asking price, i think it was well worth the risk.  ours is perfect; the wood is smooth and the paint is great.  my daughter calls the circles ""cookies"" and feeds them to her toy animals... she loves to watch me spin them like tops or roll them. she also likes to lie them out on the floor and put her different fisher-price animals or my little ponies on them, so each circle becomes a little pedestal. and, of course, they are fun to stack and sort (although at 21 months, she doesn't do them in order yet - but still having a blast).  i also purchased the plan toys pyramid cone stacker -- which is really great (and a little more creative than this one)...but it was so much more costly and this one fills a similar role.",Positive,Positive,0.040794346

"my sister n law bought this kitchen for her daughter last year for christmas who was just about to turn two years of age..i have a one and a half year old daughter and a three and a half year old daughter who go over there all the time..this kitchen is very durable, realistic with its sounds and appearance as well too. one of the best features about this toy is that 3 children can play comfortably with the toy without too many arguments...it does come with some food and pots and pans and utensils...i am debating on whether or not to buy this toy as it appears larger in size or the lifestyles kitchen as i would like for both of my children to be able to play with it ( without the youngest one having to grow taller to be able to do so )...this toy overall though is an excellent purchase..i do know that my sister n law had to fix the microwave as it was not working when they had first purchased it. other than that though the toy is great and affordable and very nice in size compared to alot of the other smaller kitchens which in areas causes alot of arguing and pushing and shoving to be able to play...i do recommend this kitchen as i have seen it plenty of times and my children have played with this toy as well too..the sink is also a very cute feature with its sounds that it makes and realistic in appearance..this toy should last for years...it is very durable..",Positive,Positive,0.029150594
"purchased this kitchen from toysrus.com and just received it a few days ago. it took my husband *maybe* 10 minutes max to put together. the directions are fairly useless as all they show are pictures and aren't *that* clear but it could not be more simple to put together. not too many screws and some snap in pieces. the stickers came all crumbled but i was able to salvage them somewhat but will contact little tikes for a replacement set (due to a poor packaging job on their part, i've had stickers from almost all of their products arrive in that condition).ok, on to the features, pro's & con's.... the kitchen in my opinion is the perfect size, not too little not too overwhelming. it fit perfectly in my kitchen (which is not large at all) and my son loves cooking right next to me. he loves the microwave but he's still a little short for it (he's 21 months) but stands on his tippy toes and that's fine (he will have lots of time to really grow with this kitchen in a variety of ways). the microwave is fabulous and i took the tip of another reviewer to not put the popcorn sticker on it which was an excellent tip, otherwise you can't see what's inside and my son loves to check out what's ""cooking"" in there. also, as another reviewer said the microwave door doesn't completely close but it's close enough and i think the only people that actually care about these little nuances are us parents:)  same thing with the oven door, that doesn't completely close either (it's a little ill-fitting) but completely unimportant. my son loves loves loves when it's says ""what would you like to cook""? ...""a hot dog"", ""eggs and bacon"" etc. he gets so excited from the sizzling sounds and that it ""speaks to him"", he also loves the sound of the running water and pushing the puttons on the microwave. i also must say little tikes did a fantastic job with the voice work on this kitchen. the voices are all little kids and they are sooooo cute, and speak very very clearly which i love. yes, it is a little loud but a very easy fix is a piece of clear packing tape over the voice box which can easily be accessed under the black ""grill"", it made a huge difference, now it's just right. the only real con i can say about this kitchen is, it would have been nice if the dishwasher and the oven opened just like a regular one not side to side but i do understand why they made it this way. i think they incorporated just the right about of sounds into this kitchen as well, enough to be engaging and not too much to take away from using their imagination. the colors are awesome, nice and clean and modern looking and the best part gender neutral! i know some people love the look of the step2 kitchen but i personally think it's old fashioned looking, dark and dreary and an eye sore -- this is fun and fresh! i know they don't sell additional food for this kitchen but really don't think you need any more sizzling and cooking food that's interactive. i will buy additional play food but what they provided that works on the stove (eggs and bacon, hot dog on a bun, mac and cheese, spaghetti & meatballs & chicken) is truly sufficient. my only concern as others have stated is losing these pieces because they don't sell replacements...yet. but, i decided to make it into a learning game with my son and teach him that food and cooking utensils do not leave the kitchen i.e. so we don't lose the pieces (so far so good;)i highly recommend this kitchen and feel that it's a wonderful toy for a toddler on up that will help foster their imagination and bring many years of smiles and laughter. it's very well made as are all little tikes products are and i love how easy it is to clean. all drumsticks up on this one!",Positive,Positive,0.118143246
"my daughter got this from santa and both of our children love toplay with it! another great buy from little tikes.  we looked around at all of the kitchen sets from all in 1 unit like this one to the separate pieces oven/fridge/etc. (these would have taken up more room).  my daughter was only 1 at the time and we opted to not purchase the infant/toddler one because she would get more long term use out of this kind. we ended up going with this particular one because it isn't obnoxiously colored like alot of the hard plastic toys- it actually appears as a ""real"" kitchen would and it didn't cost a fortune.  this kitchen comes with all the modern conveniences you would have in your own kitchen -  off white with accents - the flower pot sticker, food in the cupboards, dishwasher under counter, coffee pot, phone etc.  not too long to assemble nor difficult but electric screwdriver easiest/quickest way to go.  if you have access to a suv/truck/minivan of some sort that is the best way to transport as it does come in a large box (we have a corolla and it probably would not have fit into it)  the sayings are cute and now my son repeats alot of them - ""be careful it's hot"" and yes they can get annoying but how many young childrens toys that make noise aren't.  i feel that this feature gets the kids to interact with it even more - what is it going to say next/do next - also a plus if you only have one child - promotes self playing to give you a moments piece.  downfalls to this kitchen is phone not interactive -something with buttons would be better and there is not alot of ""counter space""  i purchased a separate bin organizer for my children to store their food and dishes in and they have a table that they use for making things at as this kitchen does not have a ton of storage or a lot of work room.  it is wide enough for 2-3 kids to play at at one time - one at microwave/kitchen sink/stove.  comes with several accessories - pots/food so that they can play with immediately but would recommend picking up a dish set and additional play food to avoid arguements over the few pieces it comes with.  overall another excellent toy by little tikes!",Positive,Negative,0.53128195

"we had the cookin sounds kitchen by little tikes and were very disappointed. first of all, the top constantly came off. second of all, the phone holder would never stay on, therefore making it useless. it did not have that many features either. it did not even have a fridge, like this one does. i got so frustrated by the thing that i took it back and got this one. i am so happy with this kitchen. everything about it is great from the talking burners to the window that opens and shuts. my daughter, age 2 1/2 years old, loves to listen to her food cook. she loves to have her brother open the window and say ""mam, i would like some eggs and bacon"". it also has a lot of storage. she can keep all of her pretend food and pots and pans in the kitchen itself. it has been used almost daily. it is just so much fun. i got mine on sale at toys r us, so i think this price is a little much, but it still is fair considering all of the options this kitchen comes with. i think it is definately worth the extra money. i really researched kitchens when i took the cookin sounds kitchen back, so that i did not make the same mistake again. i think this is the very best option out there. you won't be sorry!",Positive,Positive,0.19598646

"we had a hand-me down kitchen since my first b/g twins were 18 months, they are now 3 and have 8 month old twin brothers. we decided that a pink kitchen wasnt fit for our family, so we went in search of a new one. it was between this one and the dream kitchen. they were both, non gender specific, and both interactive. we liked this one better because the colors are more appealing to kids (atleast it was to our 3 year olds in toys r us) and that it is a little more interactive. of course this kitchen should be for pretend, but its nice that you can put eggs on the stove and it will tell you what it is, you can also buy additional interactive foods from toysrus and from amazon. it is very durable and has held up to much abuse. my 3 year olds love to cook when mommy does (ours is in the kitchen and the old one is in the playroom). we have a lot of dishes and food, and for the ones that dont fit in the kitchen, we put in a small basket next to it. its big enough for about 3-4 toddlers to play with at a time. it encourages sharing and cooaperation. my kids have alot of fun with it and they espcially like the oven, who knows why! i think this kitchen is great, cute friendly and a little more interactive than the lifestyles!",Positive,Positive,0.011562023

"the educational value of having the planets hang from our son's room is great.  at 4 years-old, he could name the nine planets thanks in large part to this ""toy"".  so i give it the highest marks in educational value.  a little tid-bit about each of the planets is provided on a panthlet in this set and i read it to our son as my husband hung the set.  our son actually memorized much of what i read to him and when the set was new he asked me to reread the panthlet to him several times to fill in the pieces of information that he had forgotten.it's also fun in that our son enjoys showing it to our guests and telling them about the planets.  however, i rate the set as 4 out of 5 stars in the fun category simply because it is more like decoration.  this set hangs from the ceiling, so you never play with it or even touch it once it is hung.  you simply enjoy looking at it and talking about it.the downside of this set is that the stars are really small stickers so you will want to purchase some larger glow-in-the-dark stars.  also it is a pain to hang this set since you have to tie fishing line to each of the planets and then use tack-like objects to connect them to the ceiling.  but once you have it all set up your child will probably be pleased.",Positive,Positive,0.07636356

"the most tedious part of this set, for me, was putting saturn's ring into place.  hanging it was not hard.  i used putty that i had bought from the store, i just figured it would work better than the included putty.  i installed this whole thing myself (stay at home mom), with a 1 year old and a 3.5 year old and a huge ladder, everyone in the same room that includes a thomas the train table to work around, and i was able to get them up in no time.  i used the smoke detector as the ""sun"" and lined them up from there.  my 3.5 year old knows the name, and color of every planet after 1 hour.  so i would say it is educational.the kit glows well, really well.  the stars included are what you would expect. they are kind of poor.  i bought a tube of the 3d stars by the same company.  it is a tube of just 30 stars.  i placed putty on them and stuck them to the ceiling.  i just figured the stars should have some dimension like the planets.  1 tube was enough for the whole ceiling.the room looks great.  i highly recommend the tube of 30 3d stars too!  they are also fantastic!  we have them in both kids rooms.  if you buy them, you will need to use a different brand of putty to hang them to your ceiling.  my husband hung the stars by string in my daughters with the included putty and they all fell.  i stuck them flat with a different putty and they are fine.i cannot tell you if they glow for an acceptable amount of time b/c i don't use them as a night light.  that seems like an unrealistic expectation of anything glow in the dark.  i use a really dim night light and my children can still see the bright stars over the dim night light.  and i am able to check on them later without walking around in a dark room.  in the day time i wish there was a sun, but at night time i wouldn't want it so it isn't that big of a deal to me that it isn't in the kit.  still haven't figured out what to do with pluto though...",Positive,Negative,0.632762

"we found this product in our local toy shop and for $15 i figured why not.  of course my 4 year old thinks the object of the game is to get the pirate to shoot out so that's always our goal.  the plastic that the knives are made out of are decent and have some flex to them to wiggle them into the slots (which occassionally you do have to tweak it just right), the plastic that the barrel is made out of is a bit cheap.  the spring that causes the pirate to shoot out is decent and so the pirate gets decent height (see the picture album for an example.)the biggest complaint that i am seeing in the lesser starred reviews is that the spot to eject the pirate is always the same.  this is user error and not the fault of the game.  the way that you randomize the pop up spot is with the pressure peg that the pirate ultimately rests on.  before you push it down to reset it - you simply twist it this causes the location of the ""the spot"" to change.my son plays this over and over and over again.  he's made that pirate pop up at least 100 times.  there have been about 5 times in that 100 that he gets all the knives in and the pirate didn't pop.  so it's not 100% accurate, but for less than 10% error on the part of the popping pirate there is no fun lossed.  if this product cost more than $20 i might complain about the general quality of it all, but for under $15 you really can't go wrong with the element of fun that it has associate with it.if you have a child that loves pirates this is a must.",Positive,Negative,0.73161006

"on the surface, pop-up pirate looks like it's aimed towards the younger crowd, but underneath that kiddy exterior is a game so complex and demanding that we mensa members even bust it out occasionally. what you don't know is that pop-up pirate uses super-advanced algorithms and formulas to determine what slit will blow that silly little pirate's top off.it is very hard to explain, but i will try to put as best as i can in layman's terms. every slit and sword color combination produces a certain number. for example; slit #17, combined with a red sword, produces the number 678. this number by itself means nothing, but once another sword is put in the barrel, a certain condition is made. for example; slit #12 with a blue sword followed by slit #8 with a green sword produces the condition ""factor of 4"". subsequent numbers that are produced must adhere to this condition, or else the pirate pop meter raises by 1. when the meter reaches 5, the pirate of course pops out of the barrel. the meter may raise more than 1 depending on the severity of a produced number's unfaithfulness to the condition, but we're not sure yet how this severity is measured.another factor to the game is where exactly the pirate lands. the location were his head meets the ground will affect the pirate pop meter in the next match. we believe that is the pirate lands on his northwestern quadrant, the pirate pop meter changes its maximum capacity to 7 in the next match. this is only a claim, but rest assured we are doing extensive testing to prove this and other hypotheses.so you see, to you it is but a simple child's game. to us here at mensa, it is an ongoing intelligent battle that we may never come to fully understand unless we preform at our very best.",Positive,Negative,0.91696674

"a few years ago, we bought the book, the scrambled states of america, from a school book fair.  my son loved the colorful, silly illustrations of the states, and the funny concepts of states getting bored with where they are on the map and deciding to switch places.  in the story, all the states loved their new locales at first, loved the weather changes, loved the different neighbors they had.  after a while, florida caught a cold.  montana lost part of itself into the ocean.  you get the idea.  the book is a fresh way to learn about geography.  instead of rote memorization, the kids had fun trying to locate all the states on the maps, and trying to remember which states we'd been to and how we drove/flew from place to place.when i saw the game in our local toy store, i thought it might be an amusing extension of the book concept.  it was a bit expensive, i thought, for two decks of cards and a few paperback maps.  but we had many other game wright games and believed the company's philosophy of designing fresh, creative games that required out-of-the-box thinking and beautiful graphics.i was delighted when we started to play the game.  the game, as it is designed, requires some basic ability to read.  the 50 ""state cards"" have state names, capitals, nicknames, and an illustration of the state shape on them.  the 60 ""scramble cards"" have instructions to find state cards within each player's hand with certain criteria, such as ""state name that starts and ends with a vowel,"" ""state closest to tennessee,""  or ""nickname that contains a person's name.""  other scramble cards ask for players to identify the card in their hands that are closest to another state.  we had an instance of this challenge (called a ""go the distance"" challenge) with hawaii--- we had to decide which state was closer, new mexico, oregon, or washington.all players are provided with their own little maps with funny states on them, as a reference.the kids loved playing the game, and did not consider it an ""education.""  it was just fun to play.  i would love to see a game like this with countries of the world.  good job, game wright!  you knocked it out of the park again.  other game wright games i would recommend are sleeping queens, match of the penguins, dweebies, wig out, and moose in the house.  yes, we bought all of them...and were glad we did.",Positive,Positive,0.0039654914

"the following review was written by ty, one of my 4th grade students:the scrambled states game is a fast pace learning game that my classmates like to play at  indoor recess when its raining or snowing. this game is so fun that when you play it once you will have to play it again and again. this whimsical mad-dashing geography game is fun for the whole family.how to play :this game can have up to four players and is ages eight and up. you will start by giving each player a u.s. map and shuffling the state (blue) and the scramble (red) cards. do not mix them. you must deal five cards out to each player. put your cards in a row. when you turn up a find it card you do what it says and try to find a match on your cards row. to start the game you turn over a find it card in the scramble deck. if you have a match to a find it card you slap the card and say the state on the card. when ending the game or the scrambled pile is depleted players count their home pile. that is the pile that you put your state cards in after you have found a match. the winner is the one who has the most states home. there will be an occasional ""go the distance"" cards and in that case you flip over the next state card and the closest one to that state gets to go home. this is a fun indoor recess game and an even more fun as a family game.pros: this game very easy to set up and put away. this game is also easily able to be stored away and can almost fit anywhere.cons: this game can loose cards easily. the game cards and box can tear easily and be broken if not taken care of.",Positive,Positive,0.0047665965

"these blocks are great!  very vibrant colors and nice quality wood (although i've also seen the guidecraft sparkley version too, and that is great as well).  these were well worth the fifteen dollar asking price at barnes and noble - but i took off a star here as i do not think they are worth much $ beyond that and def not thirty.  we love looking through them and seeing how the world changes color - and seeing how blue and yellow make green, etc.  update:  we've had them for a few months, but only played with them a lot recently (because i had them on the window)... after two days of playing with them, one of them cracked (as warned by another reviewer).  it cracked in the inner part of the class and no liquid is leaking - but i did want to note that (although these are otherwise great).",Positive,Positive,0.014380788

"this is the nerf reactor. it's a pump action blaster that fires round rigid foam balls about the size of golf balls. i am a nerf afficianado and have used lots of nerf guns, from the single-shot pistols to the full automatic ones, and it seems like i always grab this one when the battles get going. the reactor is basically a tube with a spring loaded follower inside, a stationary pistol grip at the rear and a pump action sliding hande at the front. the muzzle has a rubber seal inside to hold the balls in until fired.it's super-simple. no clips to load, handles to cock, or sights, sort of like a shotgun. there's not much to go wrong either. all you so is rack the pump. it holds 5 foam balls. the box came with four, which i thought was weird. why not give us 5 nerf?firing is also super-simple. just push the balls into the front and pump the handle. that's it! unlike some other blasters, it has never jammed, failed to fire, or disappoint me. i love the loud pop noise it makes, and the balls do fly pretty far. distance depends on how fast you pump the handle, and i could get good distance out of it. you can also fire it quickly, i can get off all 5 shots in under 4 seconds! as a note, even though the balls are rigid foam, they aren't that heavy and don't have much power behind them so even a hit to the face wouldn't hurt much, unlike a smaller dart that's flying faster.there is a slight problem though, and a big one for some. the issue is that it does take extra effort to get it to work. it's not like pulling a trigger and letting the gun do the work. even cocking a handle on other nerf blasters is easier than this. a  five or six year-old probably (you never know though!) wouldn't be able to fire this, so it does limit it to older kids.pro'slots of funsuper simplecool popping noiselightcontakes a bit of effort to work it, so it's really designed for older kids.overall, i really like the reactor. it's a classic nerf blaster that will keep going for years. i highly recommend it to anyone who loves to have fun.",Positive,Positive,0.285015

"i have wanted to buy a musini for my son for a few years now, but never found one in a retail store, online or local. i recently gave in and bought one gently used on ebay for a fantastic price including the cartridge. my entire family loves it, including my 2-year-old son. it was very easy to figure out how to use, even without a manual. on the battery case are very clear, easy to follow instructions on how to calibrate the sensitivity of your musini. within minutes we had found the perfect setting for our carpeted living room and we were all dancing. even my parents who came to visit one night were bopping to the musini! my dad couldn't keep his feet still, insisting on drumming them on the floor constantly to keep the music going when my toddler had taken a seat to rest for a minute. i have found myself taking it out during my son's nap time to put near me while i do the mundane chores around the house. it is really addicting and keeps us all moving!i can't say enough good things about this toy. the music quality is absolutely wonderful and is clear and crisp and a joy to listen to. you also tend to feel like you are actually playing an instrument when you're dancing around or even sitting on the floor tapping your fingers. the songs are mostly familiar and well-loved songs that you will instantly recognize. i have also noticed that you can use the musini to up your child's physical activity. if you change the sensitivity so that they must jump or stomp hard, you suddenly have an even greater outlet for energy and a great source of exercise! you can, of course, adjust the sensitivity so that a single finger tap across the room will register. it's up to you, and i think it's fantastic! highly recommended!",Positive,Positive,0.02684734
"this toy more than met my expectations.  i got it at clearance price, but it would have been worth it at full price or more.in addition to all the other praise the other reviews mention, a couple of things i really like:the sound quality is exceptional.  this has the best sound of any child's toy i've ever heard.  it is not at all boxy and tinny.  it's a pleasure to listen to.it has the best volume control i've ever seen.  there is a switch inside the battery compartment to set it to high or low, but then there is also a volume control knob on top.  this means that if you don't want it very loud, you can set it to low, and your child can't (easily) override that.  but they *do* have the option of turning it up and down within the ""low"" range, which is empowering to the child.the controls are big and easy to manipulate for any child, and there are lots of variations to keep things interesting.  i can see this toy being fun for everyone from a newborn on up.  my four-year-old is thrilled, and i must admit, i enjoy it, too.  i wish i'd had this years ago.",Positive,Positive,0.10155105
"neurosmith makes good toys. they're well made, durable, and stylish. their new hit, musini, is no exception to this.however, let's not go overboard on the praise.musini is a ""dance synthesizer"". it creates patterns of music based on sensors that track vibrations on the surface on which the device is placed. while the ads would have you believe it is truly a sophisticated movement tracker, it is limited to just picking up footsteps - no amount of arm waving or hand flapping will be picked up. sensitivity to footwork is adjustable.the musini has five major settings (on a twist dial in the center of the unit) for types of music: ""bach"", ""child's play"", ""latin jazz"", ""carnival!"", and ""orchestral overture"". within each type it is possible to isolate particular instruments in the polyphonic sound by pressing four colored buttons on the unit. this provides quite a bit of variety. neurosmith promises additional sound cartridges that can be plugged into a connector on the side of the unit, too.the sound of the musini is very good, driven through two stereo speakers. sound is adjustable in two spots. in the battery case is a parental control that can select a high and low range for volume. this can then be tweaked from a volume control on the top of the unit. we found the low range to be nearly inaudible. the unit does conveniently include a headphone jack that might function better with this lower range of volume. otherwise, on high the unit sounds nice. (one caveat with our unit: the higher the sensitivity setting for footwork, the more prone the speakers were to static - an annoying problem.)the unit takes four ""c"" size batteries. we would recommend using rechargeables as this device does not cycle power like some of neurosmith's other toys. kudos to the designers for including a connector for a (not included) ac power adapter.working, the musini does get people moving. it plays patterns of synthesized music based on speed and styles of footwork. the unit will increase or decrease tempo and it is possible to get it to play single notes drawn out over time. the tempo sensing lags a bit, perhaps by about five seconds, but it is still fun to get it to speed up and slow down.the musini isn't perfect, though. those hoping that it functions like a children's theramin will be disappointed. one day an advanced version of the musini will use some kind of infrared sensors to provide input via other kinds of motion, not simply picking up stomping feet. and i wonder how long the toy will remain novel for most kids - it's tough to predict, and at its price it's a potential parental heartbreaker and walletbreaker.overall, i give it about three and a half stars.",Positive,Positive,0.4936386
this is a toy that was bought for the grandkids to play with at our house. i think it should be a bit more sensitive but they don't seem to mind. if the music doesn't play they just stomp their feet when they dance and then it does. and they think stomping is fun. however they do tire of it after 20 minutes or so. it doesn't play on the carpet at all but does o.k. on the kitchen floor. i have to say though i got it at the sale price and with the clarity of the music it was worth the money and i don't regret buying it at all. besides its something all of the kids can do at the same time so i consider that a good deal. if this one quit working i would buy another one because while they're playing with it they're having a ball. the really nice thing about it is all you have to do to activate it is dance--even the babies can do that and it doesn't take them long to get the idea. a good deal.,Positive,Negative,0.8196551
"having read the other reviews i was a bit leery of ordering this toy. i was afraid it wouldn't work. i'm glad i took the chance.this is a great toy! it is fun and funny. the kids enjoy it and so do my husband and myself. it is just plain fun. as you  move, the musini makes music. if you move just a little bit, it might only play a note or two. if you move a lot, it plays a lot.i found it to be fairly sensative. we have a big front room with carpet and my husband was able to stay at the far end of the room and make the musini play by bouncing back and forth.i think it is educational in that it activates other parts of the brain than those you normally might use when dancing or playing. it encourages both large motor and small motor skills and music appreciation.it is fairly easy to use. i particularly liked that it had a parent noise level switch in the battery compartment. you can have it loud or not so loud.i look for toys that have more than a button to push. i also look for toys that encourage creativity, exploration and are educational to some degree. i look for toys that are not very loud, easy to use and fun.this toy seems to meet those requirements.well worth the money.enjoy.",Positive,Positive,0.13025025
"my son is 3-yrs old and he is infatuated with cars.  i bought this for him because he loses them a lot since he has to carry one or two everywhere he goes.  so far the cars perform well, they roll great on smooth surfaces.  my only complaint, and this is a very small complaint, is that some of the cars are raised as if they are on hydraulics.  my son likes to crash and smash his cars together so the ones that are raised slightly higher off the wheels have become damaged and by damaged i mean the wheels are kinda bent inward.  really small though since there are only one or two cars like that in the whole package of ten that he got.  overall i think the set is wonderful as far as sets of cars go.",Positive,Positive,0.042141426

"at first, i wondered if the stacking train was ever going to entertain my son.  you see the cars slide off the linking dowels, if pushed down too hard.  well, at least when traveling on carpet, which is the main playing surface in our home.  what's more, the order in which the blocks stack onto the cars is essential for movement.  the blocks don't have to stack in perfect order, but certain blocks must be stacked in the appropriate places, otherwise the wheels cannot rotate.  my husband and i noticed how aggravated will became when he first started playing with the stacking train; thus, we intervened as the toy frustrated him so.  once he became familiar with the puzzle, (2 weeks later) he began to enjoy playing with it.  the stacking train soon became a favorite, and now, 7-months later, it still amuses him for 30 minutes or more a day.i have found that sometimes the age recommendation on toys is not always accurate.  this plaything is appropriately labeled for 2 and up, and will probably continue to entertain my son for another 6 months or more.  as a side note, the stacking order is quite complex for little minds.  although this does not take away from the fun-factor, it can add to the level of frustration.  this mommy had to go on-line to see the stacking sequence so she could teach her son.the stacking train is a well-built puzzle!  it has been tossed around, stepped on, and even chewed upon, yet keeps on rolling.  there are no sharp edges on this toy, but we have had a few minor mishaps when my son, who plays rough, has pulled the dowels off the cars.  we glued them back with wood glue, and the following day this choo choo is back to rolling around on the floor.  recently, my son lost one of the blue dowels, which links the cars together.  i called the customer service number, found on the bottom of the toy, and the company replaced the entire train for nothing.  now that's excellent customer service!  overall, i recommend the stacking train as it's engaged my son for hours on end, plus the educational values are significant.other points of interest: no batteries required there are no safety concerns with this plaything, i.e. strangling, smothering, cutting, or swallowing gender neutral plaything no assembly lifetime guaranteehappy playing,mary",Positive,Positive,0.25549874
"my 17 month old son has been playing with this train for several months now and loves it! he calls it, &#34;choo! choo!&#34; and like to take the pieces all off of the train. he still isn't very good at putting all the pieces back on (he just randomly puts pieces on the pegs). but, he enjoys playing with it. :p",Positive,Positive,0.0011738429

"are you tired of the usual stacking rings that fail to challenge your child to think - if so, the melissa & doug stacking train may appeal to both you and your child.  the bright colors are visually appealing and will grab a child's attention.  the designs the stacked blocks create are interesting; they may also help you remember how the blocks are to be stacked.  this is important because the train's cars/engine will not take the proper form if the blocks are stacked incorrectly.  and believe me after the first few attempts, you will begin to question your own ability in attempting to correctly stack these.the colorful blocks are reasonably well finished.  the paint seems to be evenly applied; the interiors of the holes are a bit rough, but a light sanding with very fine-grit sandpaper takes care of that issue.  the posts on the engine and cars are short enough that i do not foresee their snapping off as did the posts on the geometric stacker which we also gave to our grandson.  however, they might still break if the pieces were dropped on a hard surface or thrown down.because there has been some concern over possible levels of barium contamination in melissa & doug products, we have chosen to reserve this toy as one that requires an adult playmate.  i have awarded the stacking train five stars because it is more challenging and more interesting than the usual stacking toy.  if it does not challenge your little one, it may still challenge you!",Positive,Positive,0.2735904

"i am a picky person when it comes to what i allow in my house for kids' toys.  this really makes the cut! i was surprised to see negative reviews.  this was a gift for my son at his first birthday.  he was already doing peg puzzles with success and this train seemed to captivate him.  he played with it several times per day everyday for several months, until he was nearly two.  one blue connector peg did need to be re-glued, but there were no other issues as mentioned in other reviews.  we have lost several of the blocks and i would consider buying another set because its that good.  if your child likes to do puzzles, pull things, hook things together, this is a great toy.  for his second birthday, we got him the farm train from the same company, and that was a big hit.  he isn't especially into trains, but the hook together and haul around feature of these trains are wonderful.",Positive,Positive,0.19434302

"this is another great toy from m&d that kids will have countless of hours playing with. there are three different toppings, enough to completely cover every slice with whatever toppings they choose. everything comes in a convenient container that sepparates all the toppings, and room for tray, pizza, and utensils. my daughter loves making slices to order, but with the placement of velcro on all the slices, it could be tricky for younger kids to get all the toppings spaced properly. the only problem my daughter had with the toy was when she was cutting slices. she would have no problem cutting the first edge, but when she'd cut the other edge the piece would slide and reattach where she first cut. it was entertaining to watch, but eventually there had to be some mommy/daddy intervention to get the first piece out of the pie. there's plenty of opportunity to teach counting, motor skills, and creating patterns with the toppings.",Positive,Negative,0.5516624

"when i saw this melissa & doug pizza set i couldn't resist getting it for our grandkids for christmas. it is ingeniously designed. all of the pieces are made of wood, no sharp or rough edges. the wedges (slices) velcro together on the edges to form a circle. &#34;toppings&#34; can be adding to the top by vecro dots too. so when you order your pizza you can chose from mushrooms, peppers or pepperoni or make it a combo! the pizza cutter and serving tool are made of wood also. the cutter actually turns! the serving tray organizes all the toppings in seperate compartments and the wedges and tools fit in the main compartment. all of the components are painted in durable colors of red, green and white - the traditional colors of an authentic pizza box!my only concern with this set is that the size of the &#34;toppings&#34; can fit in a child's mouth, and while they are large enough that they can't be swallowed and block the windpipe, i have concerns that the pieces could be turned in such a way that they could act as a plug in the windpipe. it would be easy to remove from the child's mouth, but what if you are out of the room when it happens? also, if your child is a chewer he could chew bits of wood off of the pieces and swallow them. my suggestion is to put up the pieces your child puts in his mouth or chews up until he is past that age and then give them back! i knocked off one star for the size of the &#34;toppings&#34;.this is a toy your children will use for a long time so the value is there, but be prepared to eat a lot of pizza!",Positive,Negative,0.7774905
"i bought this for my nephew's 2nd year birthday.  he's almost 4 now and when i last visited, he was still playing with it.  there is a product like this for veggies and bread and it comes with a pretend knife and it makes a cool noise when you cut the veggies.  when i was cutting veggies, i told him to cut along with me and he enjoyed it b/c it made him feel like an adult.",Positive,Positive,0.04201484
"another great melissa and doug toy!  my daughter just received this for her 2nd birthday and the fun hasn't stopped yet!  she loves to take  all the toppings off and create a new pizza each time!  we're the happy recipients of a big pizza pie all day long!this pizza set is great for hand-eye coordination and her imagination booms with each new pizza she makes.  the wooden utensils (spatula and pizza cutter) feel sturdy and i know they'll last a long time.  even better is the wooden box with lid to store the pieces so they don't get lost or misplaced.  i wouldn't recommend this for children under two since the pizza toppings are small and look fun to suck on and eat.  danger lurks ahead for little ones who aren't being supervised!i'm a huge fan of melissa and doug toys because of their great quality.  we also own the sandwich making kit, the cutting food box, and the cutting birthday cake (perfect to give as a birthday present)!  you just can't go wrong with these toys!  not only fun and imaginative but also educational!the absolute best part:  clean-up time!  she has fun sorting out (with my help, of course) the matching toppings and placing them in the same compartment together.  voil&agrave;!  another skill is being mastered!",Positive,Positive,0.19298951
"i recently got this for my 2.5 year old son.  he loves playing with it and pretends to eat the slices.  i like how all the pieces have velcro.  nothing frustrates my son more than when things fall apart on him and i can imagine the upsetting tantrum he would have if the toppings fell of the slices as he walks with a plate of pizza from one place to another.  i also love the wooden box it comes with.  it makes it easy to store, especially with the side compartments for the extra pieces.made of solid wood, very durable.  i did not have any issues with chemical smells as some have mentioned, but i did not buy it online so the chemical scent could have gone away from sitting on the shelf.  he has tried to ""eat"" the pizza and it has gone in his mouth but no chipped paint.  the pizza cutter and spatula are great bonuses.",Positive,Negative,0.7117232

"my kids love pizza.  as one comedian once said, they would marry pizza.  so, we bought this toy in the hopes that they could play pretend pizza parties.  they played with it initially, but have stopped playing with it, perhaps because the pie does not resemble the type of new york style pizza they eat regularly and more resembles a deep pan pizza.  they enjoyed cutting the pizza, but putting on toppings was a little bit of a burden to them as there are so many wood discs.  at the end of the day, they prefer other melissa and doug toys over this one like the cookie one.as with all melissa and doug toys, there is no box to store these items.  it is a big deal with this one because of the many smallish pizza topping discs.  we store each individual melissa and doug toy in a ziploc bag, which is my recommendation for their products, though this pizza tray is too long to seal the bag.",Positive,Negative,0.9877473
"i can count on melissa and doug for good toddler food play. the pizza is adorable and my grandaughter loves to serve the pizza with the different toppings. my only issue is the wooden tray that the pizza came in. there are messy hot glue spots all over the tray and the paper lining does not cover the entire tray. it was put together very poorly but it is only the storage tray, so not a major issue.",Positive,Negative,0.9754783

melissa and doug make such great wooden products and this is no exception.  my son thouroughly enjoys slicing the pizza and delivering to me and daddy.  he's 2 so we've put the toppings away until he gets older.  he enjoys the cutting process so much that i'm looking into the m&d cutting food box.,Positive,Positive,0.16711982

"open the box, plug it in, and play some of the greatest classic games of all time. they're not perfect reproductions, and they're not all joystick games, but who really cares? the games are a blast to play, and are still top of the industry in terms of sheer fun. the joystick, with batteries in, weighs and feels just right. my friends are all hardcore gamers, having spent years on xbox and playstation, etc etc... and players are still visibly tilting the controller and falling into the old habits of ""uh!"" and ""gah!"" and all those wonderful game sounds trying to make the paddle move a little faster or the blaster fire a little harder. this is great for anyone, but especially for people who remember the ""old days"". this is the golden age of gaming, reproduced as well as need be.minor complaints: the sound and authenticity are a little off, and it takes a second to get used to having to hit buttons to advance title screens. note: do read the manual/pamphlet. many of the games have extra play modes, and understanding them can add a lot of value to this toy. also, there's no true two-player mode. games that have two-player support only have the old ""p1 goes until they lose, then p2 goes"" system.there are some minor complaints to make, but this is the closest thing to atari short of going out and finding an old system. overall, 8/10. one point lost for minor sound complaints, and another for lack of true two-player elements. maybe next holiday season there will be a double-joystick pack to make that possible...",Positive,Positive,0.029168252

"we got this game for our daughter last year [she was 3] and we love it! based on bingo, zingo basically has sturdy cardboard cards that have a 3 by 3 grid with pictures and words. the cards are double-sided, the green sides are for an easier play [for younger children] ,and the red sides are for more competitive play. the plastic tiles are well-made and so is the plastic dispenser [for revealing the tiles]. younger children need not have reading skills as the pictures can help them play the game just as well - however having the words beneath the pictures reinforces learning for those who can't yet read.all in all, this is an immensely engaging and enjoyable game for younger children and the whole family.",Positive,Positive,0.0039797346
this game is a favorite in our house even after 5 years of playing it regularly. my kids are 8 and 6 now and they have so much fun with it. i love how they can play it with their friends without needing help from me sometimes! it is a very fun family time game too. highly recommended!,Positive,Positive,2.2305878e-05
"zingo is bingo and ""snap"" together in one. each player is given a card with 9 pictures on it. a dealer slides a mechanism and two tiles pop out of a plastic box. the first individual to match the tiles to their card claims the appropriate tile. play continues until someone covers the entire card or creates a previous agreed upon pattern (four corners, three in a row, etc.)durability: the tiles are a hard plastic, the dealing mechanism is also a hard plastic with no tiny mechanical parts. i expect these to last a long time. the cards are roughly 5x7 and are a thick cardboard, so as long as they are not exposed to liquid, should be fine for years to come. the only thing is that the tiles need a little bit of a strong push to be placed back in their holder. this could be an issue for younger kids; however i don't expect any breakage due to the extra force that is needed.level: this is for young kids. our oldest of four kids is 6, and he loves to play this game. however, his younger brother, who is only 2 1/2, caught on quickly to the concept and was able to start matching tiles to his card within 2-3 rounds of the game.time: the games can be completely fairly quickly. we finished games anywhere between 5 and 10 minutes. this is good with the young kids because they like clearing their cards and starting over.educational: this game can help with matching, recognition, memory and, eventually, word recognition (each picture, whether it is on the card or the tile, also has a word underneath it.)price: best price was on amazon that i could find.overall: a fun, family-friendly game for young players. wouldn't recommend for anyone older than 10 (and that is pushing it a little bit). box and pieces are sturdy. if taken care of it, it will last a long time.",Positive,Positive,0.051715422

"my kids loved this bingo game, particularly my younger son.  it is mostly a game of luck, but also reflexes, because the first person to call out that they have the picture on the chip on their card, gets to keep the chip.we used to take this to a nursing home to play with the seniors.  it is perfect for that situation (a 4 year old and a couple of seniors), because it is a simple, familiar game, and the graphics are simple and easy for everyone to identify.and, for my son, half the fun of this game was setting it up (stacking the chips in the dispenser) and sliding the dispenser forward and back to reveal the chips.highly recommended for the preschool/early elementary set.  my son is 6 now, and he still pulls this out sometimes, but he has a hard time convincing his 11 and 9 year old siblings to play.an option for older children, which has the same type of dispenser (and the dispenser is what makes this game) is ""smart mouth"", which dispenses two letters and players have to shout out a word that begins with the first letter and ends with the second.",Positive,Positive,0.028897425

"how many bingo games are there for little kids? not a lot that are as fun as zingo!we have used our game over and over. the red case is filled with hard yellow tiles that are hidden until slid forward into slots.two tiles show at a time.each player has a zingo card filled with pictures. each card is two sided, one red, one green. one color set of cards contains more shared items on a card. the other set has fewer shared items.the object of the game is to have the dealer slide the tiles forward for show and any player that has a matching picture on their card yells out the name of the picture. if they are the first to call it out, they get the tile. the first person to cover all the pictures on their zingo card gets to yell (and in our house it gets rather loud) zingo!two or more players may have a need for the same tile but it is the first to call it out that gets it.we always start by reading off the items on our cards. that gears the kids up to thinking about what they will need to look for and reinforces the picture/word relationship. each picture has the matching word underneath on the cards as well as the tiles.it does become a little mundane for parents but it is an easy game to play in 5 minutes and can be played over and over before a child gets bored.i would recommend this for children ages 3-7.",Positive,Positive,0.04416789
"i love this game.  i like the matching aspect of it, as well as the fact that it isn't as big as most bingo games, so kids with short attention spans get through it faster.  also, kids love to be the one to pull the box down.negative - you have to put the yellow pieces in right side up, if they're backwards, they'll get stuck.  also, the red cover must be on correctly, if that goes on backwards and you push hard enough, it will get stuck and you'll have a heck of a time trying to get it off and praying zingo pieces don't go flying everywhere.  the picture shows the tile being inserted into the slit at the top.  mine won't do that - the tile pieces don't fit, which always confuses the kids i work with.overall, its a really cute game.  i'd like to get the sight words one for my nephew.",Positive,Positive,0.48238137

"reviewed by: stories for children magazine editor, vs grenieri'm sure you've played bingo sometime in your life, but have you ever played zingo? zingo is bingo, but with a zing instead of a bing. well that is what the box says anyway. in fact, i found zingo much more fun then regular bingo. we got this game as a present last christmas. ok, i know what you're thinking, ""why did it take you a whole year to play this game if it's really that much fun?""well the truth is, i have a lot of board and card games. we do play games a lot as a family and we tend to play our favorites more than anything. what made me finally take the shrink wrap off the zingo game and open the box was my two-year-old daughter. yeah, yeah . . . i know that the box says for ages 4 to 8, but believe it or not, my daughter was able to play the game and enjoyed it.so how do you play the game, right? well each player has to take a zingo (bingo-like card) card. what makes the zingo card different is . . . it's two-sided. one side is for easy play and the other side is for harder play. ok, now each player has their card. you need to decide if you want to play the easy or hard side of the cards. all players have to be on the same side. now you pick a dealer. that's right . . . a dealer. but the dealer isn't dealing cards. this dealer is dealing the chips you place on the zingo card. how this works is with the zinger. the deal slides the zinger back and forward to reveal the two picture/words. each player must call out the name of the picture on the chip they need before they can take it to be placed on their card. this then covers a space on the zingo card. you play until one player has ""black-out"" . . . meaning all spaces are covered by zingo chips.so now you know how to play, get out and zingo!",Positive,Positive,0.14946347

"this is a great toy for my 3 year old.  with the new booster pack, and the ability to change for any letter and numbers to 10, this is even more educational.  finding the ball under the door is a bonus, and keeps the kids guessing.  my daughter learned most of her letters and the numbers 1 - 10 from this game.  even my 6 year old will sit down and play with her, which is hard for him to do with a lot of games.  this one can be played by the whole family, and teaches even when it is another players turn.  another great hit from cranium.***for those who have the older version with only a b and c cards, contact cranium, via their web site, and they will send you the ""booster"" pack, free of charge.",Positive,Positive,0.0778203
"essentially, i would say that cariboo is a gamed geared for three and four year olds.  it's fun and educational.  children love the balls and using the key to open up the surprise boxes.  and for the right age range cariboo will allow children to learn and practice their letters, colors and numbers as well as learn how to take turns.  (it's amazing how hard that concept can be to learn -lol)other points of interest -- this game is not noisy, and it is not one of those onerous games that older children and adults avoid like the plague.four stars.  only good for a short while, but it serves it purpose in allowing children to learn and practice their number, letter, color, and turn-taking skills.  in our experience, a game that adults and older children don't mind playing.",Positive,Positive,0.019994648
"we received this for a gift for my then 3 year old. it was so much fun. my kindergartener loved it and so did my friend's 18 month old. the kids pick a card and match the letter, color, shape with one of the doors. when they find a match, they use a key to open the door to see if they can find a ball. if they find the ball, they put it in a special hole. when enough balls fill that hole, a treasure chest opens. it looks made to have a non-competitive feel, with all kids working together to open the chest. however, competitive kids will find a way to compete, and my daughter decided the way to win was to be the first to open the chest. younger kids like the 18 month old don't pay attention to the cards, they just poke around looking for the ball, but i could tell even she had the right idea.pros:+educational, teaches letters, numbers and colors+can be played by one player or multiple players+two difficulty levels to provide appropriate challengecons:-don't lose the balls or you won't be able to open the treasure chest-cards on doors can fall off easilysummaryexcellent preschool game for toddlers through kindergarteners. learn through play!",Positive,Negative,0.5021624
"this is a review of the children's game, cariboo, by cranium.  it requires no batteries, which is great.  it has two sets of cards for either beginner or advanced levels of playing, which is also nice.  it's ideal for preschool-age children.  the skills required include simple counting, matching colors/shapes/letters - even in the 'advanced' level.  however, the fun is in hoping to find a treasure ball under one of the doors, so older children often enjoy playing this with a younger child.  i wouldn't buy this game for anyone beyond kindergarten-level, although, as an adult, i haven't gotten tired of playing it yet.  =o)  one game takes only 5-10 minutes to play, which goes by fast.  (much speedier than candyland!)when you remove the lid of the box, you find the bottom part of the box - the game itself -  already assembled.  =o)  there are three holes along the top of the game board to drop six bright rubber balls.  they roll around and randomly settle under different doors, in shallow pockets.  it helps to jiggle the game slightly, to make sure each ball found its own pocket to settle in.  you need to play this game on a hard, level surface, because otherwise the balls can be easily jarred from their pockets.  even then, sometimes a ball won't settle into a pocket, and when you open the door you see two balls crowded there.  we just consider that a special bonus.if you want to play the beginner level, you're ready to play now.  the youngest player goes first.  she draws a card from the beginner deck, and it will either be a letter (a,b, or c), a number (1,2,3, or 4), a color (blue, yellow, red, or green), or a shape (circle, square, or triangle).  no reading is required for either level of this game.in each door, a card-insert shows a picture.  (you would have to flip over the card-inserts  to play the advanced level.)  for the beginning level, the card-inserts each show a picture like three red round cupcakes, or one green square alligator.  if you drew a c card from the beginner deck of cards, you can choose any door that has a c---- picture.  the pictures are all clearly labeled, so nonreaders just match the beginning letters which are bold and capitalized.the player inserts the tip of the key into a little hole above the door, which makes the door pop open.  then you look down in there, to see if a treasure ball happened to settle underneath that door.  if so, the player pulls it out and drops it into the hole/chute along the right side of the game board, which leads to the treasure chest.  (nothing happens yet.)play continues, and as balls are found, they are all dropped into the hole/chute leading to the treasure.  the player who finds the last treasure ball (of six) is the winner.  this last ball must be pressed into the crowded chute, which pushes the line of balls to press a hidden lever which makes the lid of the treasure chest slowly open.  the treasure chest has gold glitter and a large plastic gem that does not come out.  it's just exciting to see the chest open.  that's the end of the game!for the advanced level of play, the deck of cards have either an uppercase/lowercase set of letters (aa, mm, oo, etc. - printed in four different colors), or a numeral from 1 to 10 (printed in four different colors).  the player can choose to open a door with a picture of that many objects (8 strawberries, etc.) or if the label of the picture includes the letter he drew (doesn't have to be the first letter).  or, they can open a door if the picture is the color of their printed letter/numeral.the game moves fairly quickly, and doesn't have to be played competitively.  a child could play alone, or with one player drawing the cards and the other player using the key each time, etc.  it could even be played alone.our preschool daughter loves this game and begs to keep playing it over and over again.  i highly recommend it for fun, and developing quick observation skills - although there is no time-limit, the excitement of possibly finding a treasure ball motivates the child to quickly count sets or seek matching letters.great game!!!!",Positive,Positive,0.303846
"i was a little unsure if this game was going to be age appropriate for my 5 year old son, but he received it as a gift.  it is perfect for him because he is just learning his abc's.  we have two older girls 7 and 6 who already know all of their abc's, shapes, numbers and colors.  our three children play this together (and i don't have to supervise).  the kids love this game!!!!  this game teaches some of the basics children need to start kindergarten.  we have only had it for a few days and they can not get enough of it!  i even have fun playing.  it is very durable and really keeps their attention.  the rules are simple and can be played by just the children.  i would not recommend this game for children over 6, because it would be too easy.  my only wish is that it had replacement ""doors"" to add more letters and numbers.  great practice for kindergarten!  the children learn without even knowing they are doing it!  awesome!!",Positive,Positive,0.00072544045

"i am glad i ignored some of the negative comments regarding this game and purchased it anyhow.  i know some reviewers thought that there was not much to this game and that kids quickly tired of it.  however, this has become the favorite of my 3 year old.  we have yet to try the ""advanced pack"" included, and she is still have lots of fun with just the beginner level.beyond what you are given in this game, there is lots of room to add things on your own.  even for the ""artistically challenged"" parent, with just a few blank index cards, a pack of colored pencils (or stickers) and about 20 minutes of your time, you can bring this game to a whole new level.  since the cards just snap into the game top, it would be easy to draw another set that is a bit more challenging or better meets the interests of your child.i also found this game to be a great way to teach turn-taking.  since there is only one key, it's not possible for another child to jump ahead of their turn.overall, i found this game to be well put together, interesting for children and has the potential to be expanded by the parent to a more challenging level. the only warning i can offer is that the small balls included are very tempting (just like superballs!).  i would guard them since all 6 are required to open the treasure chest.  thus if one was lost, the game would be useless.",Positive,Positive,0.19351277
"this game is one of the best i have bought for my almost 3 yr old. she can sit and play it with a friend (with my supervision for turn taking) and they can figure out most of it by themselves! she even explained to grandma how to play. it is holding up to much abuse and use. the kids open doors with their ""key"" (which she loves to do) and are looking for balls. once they find all six and drop them into the collection hole the treasure chest opens. my daughter doesn't mind that it opens to the same purple jewel all the time. one time i did remove the purple jewel and put in a hersey kiss and she thought that was great too! but just finding the balls and matching the cards to the game board is plenty of fun in and of itself. i highly recommend this game for little kids. the nice thing is the cards turn over for a more advanced matching game. i forsee that by age 4-5 she will grow out of it, but with younger siblings still to come i think this game will get plenty of use.",Positive,Positive,0.019018147
"this was a favorite game for my two kids. i'm sorry to hear that it might no longer be manufactured? even though my kids have outgrown it, they still want to keep it and love using the key to open the doors.as preschoolers, the idea is perfect. they don't need to know how to read and their level of learning can be at colors or shapes, beginning letters, or groups of 1, 2, or 3.finding the balls is a joy to little kids and getting to use the key is super cool. when the treasure box opens, they are thrilled.i would recommend placing your child at the front of the game. otherwise they can see sideways through the open doors to the bottom of the game and see if there are other balls nearby.they also always wanted to take the jewel out of the treasure chest but it is fixed in place. it would have been cool to have it removable.sorry to see this game in limited availability but if you see it at a yard sale, pick it up!",Positive,Positive,0.14387558
"first i'd like to point out that even if your child already knows his/her abcs etc., you then use the ""advanced"" level of the game, in which you flip the cards over and there is something different on the other side. on the back side of the abc/color cards are different pictures with a whole word written out in all lower case letters. this is great for repetition of reading skills and phonics. there is a different set of playing cards for the advanced version, all this is included when you buy the game.my only gripes are if you do have to flip the cards back and forth between beginner and advanced on the ""doors"", they are pretty thin and can get bent easily, so i can see how you could really wear this game out. we use the ""beginner"" cards when my 2 year old is playing with us, the ""advanced"" cards when it's just my 5 year old and i (daddy plays too, when he gets home from work).also, if you are not right above the board, there is the possibility of cheating by being able to see where some of the balls are. but that's not necessarily a bad lesson, either (learning to resist the temptation)!anyway, we just love this game and the very first day we had it, my 2yr, 5yr old and i played 5 games together, then my 5 yr old and i played 10 (count 'em, 10!!!!) games in a row during the little one's nap!! wow! she would have kept going but we were sitting on the floor and my back was hurting!!! :)",Positive,Positive,0.033389427
"this got the immediate ""thumbs-up"" from my 4-yr old daughter.  she had me playing it over and over and over and when i had enough she carried on alone.  i like that the game can be made more advanced by changing from the beginner cards to the advanced cards provided in the box.i would have granted the game 5 stars if the balls didn't occasionally get stuck so that when all the doors are open there are still balls not found.  i have learned to check there are no balls in the secret tunnels before the play commences so it is no big deal.i would certainly look at other games in the cranium series.",Positive,Positive,0.41085353

"ok i am not sure why there is all the confusion, but this is cariboo- not hullabaloo or cranium or the balloon one. i love all the cranium games, but since this is cariboo let me talk about that-this is a game for 2 year olds and up, or maybe even 18m old toddlers can get into it too.there is a board that hides 6 balls, i think. each player takes a card, which can be set at beginner or intermediate. the beginner is abc, 123, and shapes, the intermediate is all the numbers and letters and both have colors. when you get a card you have to match the card to one of the tiles.  then open it with a ""key""  to see if there is a ball beneath.  if there is a ball you put in the treasure chest.  once all 6 balls are in the chest opens to reveal a jewel.my daughter is 2 and absolutely loves this game.  we play it almost every day.  at first she would just use the key to open the tiles and get the balls.  that was around 18months, now at 2.5 she can follow the rules and take turns.we plan on graduating up to hullabaloo for her 3rd birthday!",Positive,Negative,0.70816666

"honeybee tree  is a cute game.  the packaging is cute, the play parts are cute, the bee's are even cute.  i say this straight off because this is truly an easy game to like, especially from a child's point of view.the package contains a tree with a bee hive on top, a bunch (about 30) branches for the tree, and 20 ""bee's"".  to set up the game assemble the two part tree - the tree serves as the play board, shove the branches through holes in the bee hive at the top of the tree, toss in the bees.  the branches serves as ""stops"" that keep the bees from falling through the hive, through the tree into a receptacle at the bottom of the tree.game play is kind'a like pick up sticks, each player withdraws one branch at a time trying to not let the bees tumble down into the receptacle.  one after another each player continues to pull the branches out until all the bees have left the hive and fallen down.  each keeps tract of how many bees he/she has ""freed"".  the winner of the game is the player with the fewest bees.the game is actually a lot of fun for four to eight year olds.  our child wanted to replay, and replay, and replay.  plus, when we stopped playing the game the parts of the game became incorporations into other ""games"".  the bees guarded a castle, the tree became a hiding place for a ""little people"" character.  i think the six year old had even more fun playing with the bees and tree with her other toys than she had playing the honeybee tree game itself.the one down side is that the setup for the game takes about five minutes between sessions.  sticking the branches through the tree is simply a time consuming task.  and it takes a coordination that may be beyond the ability of many children.  but the overall utility of the game is worth the effort.",Positive,Negative,0.7070179
this was a great game for 4 yr old granddaughter.  she loved the colorful bees.  a little hard to put leaves in without some adult help.,Positive,Positive,0.0029304842
"i thought this was a rather cute and endearing spin on the classic ""kerplunk"" game.  (it definitely doesn't win any points for originality).  the game is well-made and nicely designed.  it does take a while to get all the leaf sticks through there, and once you get down to the last five or six, it's rather tedious to get them in properly.the bees are cute, and add an extra element to keeping them up or making them fall than plain marbles.the one thing we didn't really like was that the instructions state to turn the trunk of the tree for each player's turn, so if they get any bees, they fall into their well.  well, the thing is full of bees, and it's really difficult to turn the trunk, and that takes more time than anything.  we ignored that bit of instruction after a few turns, because it was just ridiculous.  it doesn't rotate easily enough to do that every turn.  also, the wells in the ""meadow"" base aren't big enough to hold more than a few bees.  what we ended up doing is just rotating the whole unit and keeping our bees in front of us on the table.so the wells are basically useless (half the time the bee comes shooting out over it anyway) and the instructions to rotate the tree trunk are clearly given by people who haven't even tried to play the game, but other than that, we found it to be a fun and enjoyable game to play for our family game night.  it's definitely great for smaller kids too, as it's not too difficult to play.  my seven-year-old son loved it.also, it does come in a nice, sturdy box, but once you've unpackaged everything, there's no way to organize it within the box.  you kind of just end up dumping it all back in.",Positive,Negative,0.82112855

"my preschool class wants to play this all the time. ages 3 -6. they love pulling the leaves to watch the bees fall.it takes a short time to play, however a long time to set up. you have to put each leave into the hole and feed it across. it is hard for the preschoolers to do. which means i have to set up the game for them to play. it would be great for a time you want to sit down and play with your kids, but not for independent play.so while my preschoolers gravitate to this game often, i do not.",Positive,Positive,0.08057729
"i am a speech therapist in the schools and use this game with preschoolers up to about age 9.  there are great vocabulary themes you can use with it for language, but i mostly use it for articulation drill.  it is great for fine motor coordination too.  usually takes the kids a minute to get in a leaf so it allows for lots of repetitions (work) between.  the kids love this game.",Positive,Positive,0.00077772135

"this is such a cute and joyous game to play!  first off, it keeps my little nieces entertained for a good few hours which is usually nearly impossible.  it is so fun to play and watching the girls focus so intently on which leave to pull and then have the bees ""wake up"" is a riot!  you really do have to be careful and it really is tricky to do.  i also love the fact that for a little while their faces are focused on something tangible rather than a movie or video game.  this is a joy to play!",Positive,Positive,0.079245925
"i like the simplicity of this game and how long it takes to play. young kids tend to lose interest in games that take too long. this is a nice short game and simple to understand. the unfortunate part of it is that the branches are not easy to get in. they go in easy at first when there aren't many other branches, but after a few it becomes increasingly more difficult. i think hive shape of the top add to this, but it doesn't ruin the game. i do like the game and i'm glad to add it to my kids game collection.",Positive,Positive,0.024810461
"yes this game is cute.  the bees are adorable, and yes it does take way too long to set up, that said.  it's fun when you get it going and the older kids can usually tackle the set up process themselves.  the fact that a few can drop out (instead of the whole bunch) adds a lot to the game.  if you know what you're getting into, and don't mind dropping what you are doing for a few minutes here and there, then i think you will be happy with honeybee tree.",Positive,Positive,0.48130825

"james was the first battery powered thomas train we bought for our 2 year old son.  he takes a single ""aa"" battery, which is installed by unscrewing a single screw on the bottom, and lifting the body of the train off.  when you push the button on the top, he comes to life, moving at a surprisingly fast clip, and his lantern glows brightly.  the great thing about the battery powered trains is that they are perfectly capable of being played with without power, and as long as the button is not pushed down (even without battery), the wheels roll freely.  if you have the button on, the wheels will lock up and grind when you try to free-wheel it.  just something to be aware of.all of the battery powered trains are built the same way, and they are all die cast metal instead of wood (with the exception of the tender car, if the train has one like james).  this adds considerable weight to the train, and if dropped (or worse, thrown), really can hurt.  so be aware if you have a temperamental engineer!the speed of the engine with a fresh battery may pose some problems when navigating particularly curvy or technical track layouts, but with guidance does just fine.another thing to be aware of is that if you use track other than the thomas track with the traction etched into it, these engines may have some difficulty going up steep hills.  we have a few pieces of track from other random sets (like brio), and sometimes the train won't make it up and over a hill depending on how big of a load they are carrying and how new a battery is in there.i have not experienced that they make my son ""lazy"" about pushing his other trains, as some other reviewers have noted, but of course, all children are different.  he really enjoys the hands on approach, and even when james or his other battery powered engines are going on their own, he gently keeps a finger or two on them constantly!overall these are really fun additions to the set.",Positive,Negative,0.53232133

"pros:- very powerful, can pull a long chain of trains on a wooden track (or take it off-track to watch it pull a train across the house on smooth floors)- moves relatively slow, but not too slow (slow enough that it's not racing around the track and derailing, but not so slow that it's sluggish)- runs on a single aa battery- grippy rubber-lined wheels- 4-wheel pulling (the two front and two rear)- center wheels lift up and out of the way around tight turns- strong die-cast metal housing lasts long with rough play (kind of like a matchbox car)- heavy weight helps give it good traction to pull trains- gears disengage when not turned on (so kids can push it along the track without breaking the gears)cons:- stupid battery-draining incandescent light that's too weak to see, but drains the battery quickly (i cut mine off; see below)- no auto-shut-off (on the model i have), so the battery dies quickly after a child lets it run into an object and never turns it off- no visible indication for when it's turned on other than a slightly depressed power button (the black patch on top of the train)- motor brushes wear out sooner than i'd expect (see below)i bought this train here on amazon on march 1, 2010 (~19 months ago) for my 2.5-year-old kids.  they loved it and have played with it often.  it has survived many droppings, slobber, being left running against a wall, tossed in toy boxes, etc.  the train is unbelievably strong -- i've had it pull about 10 other cars around a track and up ramps with no hesitation.  it's heavy and has grippy rubber-lined wheels, so it doesn't slip.  my kids play with this train both on and off the track; sometimes they just put a long train to run across the whole house on the floor.  my kids have played with this often and it has caused me to stock up on aa batteries.the things i don't like is that it has a stupid lamp in the front that isn't even noticeable, but drawn a lot of battery power (kind of like running a small flashlight in addition to the motor).  battery life increased substantially after i made a small incision above the front-right wheel to cut the red power wire for the light (used a dremmel with a cut-off wheel to carefully cut through the housing and snip the wire).another thing is that it doesn't have an automatic off feature (or at least the version i have doesn't).  so, often a brand new battery would go dead in a day because one of the kids left the train running after it smashed into a wall or other obstacle.  the product description now indicates that it has an auto-off -- i hope that's the case.the train's motor and gearbox is sealed using two triangular head screws, making it very difficult to open (if you want to try to make repairs).  i got past this by using the dremmel cut-off wheel to notch a flat head into the screws.  i did this recently because after 19 months of abuse, the engine seems to be running sluggishly and batteries don't last.  i figured the motor needed a little tune-up, so i disassembled it.  i found that the brushes on the motor had worn out pretty badly and could not be feasibly replaced.  i helped it a little, but it still runs like it's ""tired"".so, i've just added a replacement train to my shopping cart!  yup -- this train was so worth the money that i'm getting a replacement for the old worn-out one my kids love.update on 10/10/2011:the train does not have an automatic shut-off feature, as the product description claims it does (see the description from the manufacturer).the new train i ordered is running great (after i cut-off the battery-draining lamp); the train it replaces really was worn down from too much play.  =-)",Positive,Negative,0.7159871
"battery-powered thomas was purchased after we had such a good experience with battery-powered james, and seeing how much my 2 year old enjoyed this added dimension to his train play.thomas is powered by a single ""aa"" battery, which is installed by unscrewing a single screw on the bottom, and lifting the body of the train off.  when you push the button on the top, he comes to life, moving at a surprisingly fast clip, and his lantern glows brightly.  the great thing about the battery powered trains is that they are perfectly capable of being played with without power, and as long as the button is not pushed down (even without battery), the wheels roll freely.  if you have the button on, the wheels will lock up and grind when you try to free-wheel it.  just something to be aware of.all of the battery powered trains are built the same way, and they are all die cast metal instead of wood (with the exception of the tender car, if the train has one like james).  this adds considerable weight to the train, and if dropped (or worse, thrown), really can hurt.  so be aware if you have a temperamental engineer!the speed of the engine with a fresh battery may pose some problems when navigating particularly curvy or technical track layouts, but with guidance does just fine.another thing to be aware of is that if you use track other than the thomas track with the traction etched into it, these engines may have some difficulty going up steep hills.  we have a few pieces of track from other random sets (like brio), and sometimes the train won't make it up and over a hill depending on how big of a load they are carrying and how new a battery is in there.i have not experienced that they make my son ""lazy"" about pushing his other trains, as some other reviewers have noted, but of course, all children are different.  he really enjoys the hands on approach, and even when james or his other battery powered engines are going on their own, he gently keeps a finger or two on them constantly!overall these are really fun additions to the set.",Positive,Positive,0.4541071
"if you have a child that is a thomas fan, this battery-operated thomas is sure to please them.  this is one of my son's most-often played toys, among all of his (many) thomas trains.  it was one of the first trains he was able to use, because it didn't require him to understand how pushing down on a track with a train can make it come apart.  he could turn on thomas, let thomas do the navigating, and add cargo cars to for thomas to pull.despite the fact that he is a little older, tracks are more elaborate, and he is capable of pushing long car trains around the track himself, battery-operated thomas still gets lots of play.  thomas and his cars go one way, while my son pushes a train another way, and eventually they meet (and sometimes collide!)the fun factor is definitely here on this toy, however we have owned this train for about a year, and it is worn out and we are in need of a replacement.  the rubber around the wheels has worn almost completely off in spots, making it impossible for thomas to navigate/travel the track.  this is disappointing to me, especially for the price you pay for one train.  we did get a lot of use out of this, but it seems disappointing that this would be rendered useless after a year.despite this, i have bought another one of these for my son's christmas presents.  he likes it too much not to.",Positive,Negative,0.6679284

"my wife and mother in law were standing around trying to figure out what maddie might want for a holiday gift, and maddie was playing with the leapfrog table, ignoring everything else on display. when they tried to get her to leave, with one of her own, she wouldn't let go of the one in the store. it's got the place of honor in the living room, and so far hasn't lost it's appeal.as with all musical toys, the big thing is how much does the child like the sounds it makes. our child loves the sounds this one makes. there is a large variety of possible sounds, and some are more or less favorite. the banjo and the piano sounds will get her dancing, so those are clearly good. i hear the drum sounds a lot too. a big thing from a parent point of view is that there is a way to turn the volume on this toy down, and it's loud enough for her to hear while the child plays with it, but no so loud that the banjo tune burns itself into the parent's memory forever. it has a lot of different controls that all move differenly, which encourages some exploration, which is good from a learnign perspective, but it's not terribly challenging, except for the switching modes by turning the page. i'm inclined to think that concept is way over our 13 month old's head, but then i notice that while she plays with the page, it never ends up on the ""letters and numbers mode"", and i know she likes the music mode better. so maybe she does understand it.the dog doesn't seem inclined to chew on it, so my usual yardstick for durability doesn't apply, here. it seems sturdy enough, but the door for the secret compartment seems a little flimsy.",Positive,Negative,0.7826724
"my ten month old daughter loves this table! she loses interest in her other toys pretty quickly, but she plays with this table all day! it helped her learn how to pull herself up and stand up assisted and alone. now she's starting to walk already and i think that this table had a lot to do with helping her. there's a lot of music and lights on the top of the table to keep her interest. she likes banging on everything and having it all light up at once and make a bunch of noise. she's been playing with this table since about seven months - and she doesn't show any signs of getting bored with it. i'm so glad that i bought this table for her! it's very durable and very easy to clean off - i just use a soapy sponge to go over everything.the price on amazon.com is pretty reasonable too! i paid two dollars more for it when it was on sale at walmart! so amazon definitely has a good buy on it!i recommend this toy for any little girl or boy!",Positive,Positive,0.05478201

"the leapstart learning table by leapfrog has not only been a source of smiles and distraction for our 9-month old (who has been playing with it for a couple of months now). it has been a truly educational toy for him. the table has detachable legs, so your baby can begin using it as soon as s/he can hold the head up and sit still. it has a &quot;page turner&quot; in the middle which swicthes all the buttons, keys and devices from a 'song mode' to an 'instrument mode'. when in song mode, all the devices sing back to the baby: some of them &quot;a-b-c&quot;, others &quot;1-2-3-4-5...&quot;, and a few others sing opposites such as &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;. when in instrument mode, pressing the buttons and keys and turning the wheels will make sounds of musical instruments come out of the learning table.today, months after starting to use it, i see santiago flip pages in a book with ease, and his love for music increased. i can only say: leapstart and diapers are two things that you cannot leave home without. and that's to remind you: it doesn't weight too much, so it's highly portable! forget about the copycats that followed suit. this is the original and it's worth every penny.",Positive,Positive,0.4726813

"based on the reviews here i felt this activity table would be too overstimulating for my often times sensitive (almost) 11 month old.  however then we saw the table in the store and he loved it.  we purchased it for him for his birthday, but let him play with it for a day to make sure he'd like it enough to warrent the price tag.  he couldn't get enough of it!within minutes he'd learned to slide the trombone, push the lever for the cello and flip the lever for the bango.  the little door that says ""hello"" and ""bye-bye"" fasinates him as well as the spinner with the beads.  he has never really danced to music before, but after playing with this table for one day, he is now dancing to the music this and his other toys make.  i think he noticed that the table was not in the mix of other toys the next morning and i'm sure he's wondering where it went.pros:unlike some other tables we tested, this one has some rubber grip on the feet to keep it from scooting on the carpet.  it does scoot a little on the hardwood, though.two volume settings, and the louder isn't too loud.can still be utilized if the table is turned off completely, unlike some other tables we looked at.  great to keep baby occupied and save mommy's sanity.wide variety of music.  i'm not sure exactly how many songs this plays, but i would guess at least 20.cons:the sound the trombone makes is really a muted trumpet.  baby isn't going to know this, but it bugs me.the hinge on the little door on the hidden compartment is flimsy and the door comes off easily.  maybe that's just on our table, though, because we got a display to save a little money.there are limited places for baby to put his hands that don't have ativities associated with them.  as such, my supported stander keeps flipping one thing but balancing himself on another activity, which overrides the first.  eventually he'll grow out of that ""challenge"" but it seems to frustrate him a bit now.overall this is a wonderful table and i'm glad i didn't make too hasty of a judgement of it before seeing it in the store.  it's well worth the money.  i think this will be a favorite for some time.",Positive,Positive,0.36604366

"we purchased this for our daughter almost 3 years ago and she got a lot of use out of it.  she learned her basic colors and her some shapes a lot faster because the toy reinforces them.  even our 8 month old son loves this toy!!  i love that the legs can detach from the toy if needed.  it has great educational value!  it helps teach counting, shapes, alphabet, colors and opposites.  we love this toy and highly recommend it!",Positive,Positive,5.388818e-05
my daughter loves this toy. she stands up with it all the time and just plays. if i'm doing laundry and don't want her to crawl up my leg i put a few puffs in the little box area. (under the purple lid is empty space we use for puffs.) she plays and grabs a snack here and there. she normally plays for at least 30mins. before getting poor which is the longest she'll play with any of her toys. it's also just the right height for my 9months baby which makes it just that much better. we actually tried a few out at second had stores just to check height and most are a lot lower to the ground so she'd rather sit that stand with them and i was looking for something to help he stand by herself so this was all around perfect.,Positive,Negative,0.8466293
"my sister-in-law sent this to my 1 year old daughter as her christmas gift, and she loves it! she quickly learned how to spin the wheel to make the music play or play the abc song (her favorite song right now!). she also loves to open and close the purple flap repeatedly and is especially delighted when we hide something small in the pocket that she discovers when she opens the flap. she can spend quite a few minutes at a time dancing to the music, spinning the wheel, opening the flap, etc. and walks around the table to reach the different elements. my only mild complaint is that the purple flap keeps coming off. my daughter has learned that she only needs to pull at it a little and it will come off. i would have given this product 5 stars except for that little (but annoying) detail.",Positive,Positive,0.16530427
"my daughter received this toy for christmas. she will be 1 in january. i think it is very colorful and has some really neat actions on it. she would easily stand there for 5-10 minutes(which is long for her) and play with this toy. another wonderful aspect of this toy is the enunciation. i am always amazed at the clarity of the voices of these toys now days. they are far from the rumbling and cracking of the voices on toys when i was younger. when it sings the abcs i just listen in awe at how clearly all the letters can be heard. just amazing, its an all around great toy that i would recommend to everyone!!!",Positive,Positive,0.097127795

"my son received this table when he was 8 months old, and still plays with it on an almost daily basis.  the legs are detachable, i guess so it can be placed on the floor for babies, but we never did that...  this table helped our son into a standing position, and encouraged him to &quot;cruise&quot;. the variety of music it provides is great, and hasn't even begun to get old yet (even for mom &amp; dad). now at almost 2, i've noticed that my son is starting to make his own music instead of just &quot;pressing buttons&quot; .  pressing the drums, the piano, then back to the drums... i'm sure this table will last for years to come, especially once he becomes more interested in his letters, numbers, and colors. i would definitely recommend this product for every child!",Positive,Positive,0.024905184
"we purchased both a fisher price laugh and learn table and a leapstart learning table.  the plan was to see which one our daughter (7 months at the time) liked best.  we would keep the one she liked best at home and send the other to grandma and grandpa's house.  here is how the two compare.1.  the fisher price table is shorter than the leapstart table and baby seems to be able to pull up on it at a younger age. baby can also sit at the fisher price table easier because it is lower.2.  both have stable legs and do not tip over when baby leans up against them or pushes on them. both have legs that can be removed for floor play when baby can not stand.  (we never used it this way because our daughter was early to stand.)3.  both have a learning mode with abc song and counting to 10 song and a musical mode.4.  in the musical mode the laugh and learn table plays tunes to familiar children's songs.  it has a traditional feel to the music.  the leapstart table has music based on the different instruments on the table such as a banjo tune, a sax sound, etc. and it has a jazzier feel to the music.5.  the laugh and learn table has a food theme and looks like a set table.  in the learning mode concepts such as color, shapes, texture, manners, shapes, open/shut, empty/full, peek-a-boo, and naming of common items such as apple, blueberries, banana, juice, etc.  the leapstart table has a musical theme with instruments such as a piano, maracas, sax, violin, and banjo.  in the learning mode concepts include colors, shapes, high, low, on, off, hello, goodbye, etc.6.  on the laugh and learn table the parent has to change the mode.  on the leapstart table the child can change the mode by turning the page on the book in the center of the table.7.  the laugh and learn table has a bowl in the center that spins and can hold favorite objects.  the leapstart table has a small purple door that can hold favorite objects in the indentation underneath the door.as a parent, i like the leapstart table more.  the music is parent friendly and even after repeated use, it does not annoy adults.  i also like the different musical instruments and musical sounds that are introduced.  that said, my daughter (now 9 months) likes the laugh and learn table better.  she likes putting objects like small balls, cheerios, and her pacifier in the bowl in the center.  she also likes the peek-a-boo napkin with the peas underneath which says ""peek-a-boo.  i see you."" when she opens the door.  it makes her laugh. another favorite is the spoon rattle that can be removed from the table and the alphabet letters that float in the water sealed in the bowl that move around when the bowl spins.  this is her favorite toy.  she does play with the leapstart table at her grandparents house now, but her attention span is short with this toy.  she can play with her laugh and learn table for long periods of time.",Positive,Positive,0.27627456

"among the leap frog products, this learning piano is terrific.  we've had it in our home for the last two years, and it's just as much fun as it was when it first entered our home.there are basically four areas of interest on this piano.  there's the piano sound, banjo, woodwind sound, and saxophone sound.  then when you push each little circle with the picture of the instrument, you get a variety of different songs.  for example, the banjo sound plays the tune, among others, of ""oh susanna,"" and the piano sounds gives a really neat instrumental version of a ragtime piece.if for some reason you just push the button, the music will play for several seconds, and then the little voice will come on and say ""press any key to play the song,"" and then you can continue the music up to the end by continuing to hit the keys.  it looks as if you're really playing the piano, too.our girls have loved this, and its importance is in teaching not only the variety of music, but the different kinds of instruments, and the fun of interacting physically with the sounds, among other things.this product is really great!!  and highly recommended!!",Positive,Positive,0.14277042
"i bought this toy for my daughter when she was a year old and she immediately took to it.  she loved pressing the keys and looking at herself in the mirror.  it's two years later and she still plays with it regularly.  now she likes turning the lights off and seeing the light bar around the mirror light up to the sound of the tunes.  she also likes hearing the different musical instruments and singing to the tunes.  it's held up very well.  it doesn't look new, but it also doesn't look beat up either.  even though she knows all her shapes, she still likes pressing the keys and hearing how the shape's name is pronounced.  also, it shuts off by itself if not in use and the batteries last an extremely long time (i think i've only changed them once in two years).there might be two minuses, though they don't bother me in the least.  if your child likes kissing his/her reflection, expect to clean the mirror regularly.  also, some people might think it might be a little loud, though compared to some toys, and in my opinion, the volume is not that bad at all.all in all, i would recommend this toy for parents of infants who want something durable and will keep their child's interest for years to come.",Positive,Positive,0.35142568

"i use this with my 2 year old(27 mo), and the level is about right, i think a child who knows their abcs etc would not appreciate it, but my son who was reluctant to use crayons loves to hear pooh bear or tigger talk to him.  so he spends 30-40 min at a time coloring which he would not do previously. the basic abc sheets are not very interesting, but we color a few of those and then move on to pooh bear each day and i guess some of the information sticks.for his age group, i have to play with him, but he is catching on to the go circle, and i am thrilled when he attempts to color within the lines, and matches specific colors with specific objects like yellow bananas... this is also a redesign.  it does not have snap on templates with numbers, or the coloring template like the previous design.  the blue lid which holds the coloring page in place does come off occasionally, but only if he tries to open and pry it off, not while coloring.  i don't notice any problems with sensitivity so far, but if you are not right in the middle of an object, it won't identify it for you.  not a problem so far since he seems just too young for the game mode where this might lead to frustration.for the future, i'm not sure if this toy will lead to independent play since you have to keep changing coloring sheets etc.  all of which can lead to numerous toddler decisions and frustrations.  despite the high price, this is a great great way to encourage coloring / writing skills though for your boy who would much rather be playing with trains or cars.",Positive,Positive,0.2280388
this is perfect for a child between 2-5. my son loves it and has used it for a long time. and has a large variety of leap products. it's perfect because it goes from him to his brother. they love to color and it teaches the phonics and letters/numbers/shapes of the alphabet/numbers/shapes at the same time. it has a game feature to help ensure the understanding of the letter/number/shape.the cool feature of being able to print the letter or so forth that you are trying to work on is a cool feature. and the ability to go on the net and get others help expand the life of this toy.great buy!,Positive,Positive,0.0004576179

my son got this toy for his second birthday last october and really loves it.  i guess it is similar to the leap pad but since i've never seen the leap pad i'm not sure.  the board basically fits storybooks on it along with a cartridge that accompanies each book.  kids turn the page and the interactive story book plays and responds to your childs touch.  they can press on basically everything on each page and hear a sound or phrase and even play simple number and color games.  the voices are right out of sesame street for the book that comes with the set.it's quite easy for kids to turn on and use all by themselves.  the toy is quite durable and is not a battery hog.  i know that there are many more story books out for the leap pad. hopefully fisher price will continue to support the toy with more and more story books because it is a very well made toy.  very educational and fun for kids.,Positive,Positive,0.15849367
"my daughter just received this for her 3rd birthday!i was apprehensive after being pretty disappointed with the my first leappad.it is a hit with my 5 1\2 year old as much as the 3 year old!both can use it easily, and differently.they dont need me to do anything for them and the cartridges always work unlike the my first leappad.i love how it is that versitile for both ages.it even has things the kids can play with no book or cartridge in it!  using the alphabet printed on the sides.a very pleasant surprise here!",Positive,Positive,0.1908498
"we just bought this for my 2-year-old daughter for her birthday after having played with the display at target over and over again. her first response was ""wow!"". this book is a big improvement over the leappad systems as it allows your child to use his/her finger to guide them rather than a pen.  it is definitely more user-friendly for the younger kids because they do not need to touch the ""go"" circle to make the book work; a concept good for the older kids only.  it comes with 2 books to get started: a sesame street book and a k-2 grade learning guide.  if fisher price can get their power touch library expanded to include more titles sooner rather than later, it will give leappad a run for its money.",Positive,Positive,0.45928887
"although i've read the reviews and the manufacturer's description of the toy, actually having it in my hand: it's amazing.  on one page your child can hear the story read to them; touch any word and it is verbalized (""sing""); in phonic mode, touch the same word and it is sounded out (""s-ing""); touch the characters or pictures on the page and it would say who or what it is or imitate person/thing; spell words; the game will ask you to find similar items - you touch it and it would agree and count the item if correct; music!!! on one page!!! and each book has about 25 pages!!!  the pages are chuck filled with characters (people and things) so that it can take a while to go through if your child is really curious.5 stars for fun because of the myriad of activities and the fact that she doesn't have to hear mommy's voice reading to her all the time.5 stars for educational value because of what i described above.5 stars for durability because i bought this used and it's in excellent condition.  i believe you have to show children how something is to be used - open on table, or on lap if sitting on floor mat - and the likelihood of it being destroyed is reduced.  parents also need to know that the child would still need their attention to go through the book even though they can touch, because it makes the child feel encouraged/loved/special.  so give them the book, but spend time doing the activities too.people complained in their reviews that there aren't enough books - but each book does so much it can hold attention for a long while.  for example, the child may only want to hear the story and touch the pictures initially but as they grow the words and their sound/pronunciation and the spelling will become more important/relevant to them.  and actually, there are at least 6 beginner books that i've found - i've purchased 3 for now because i think it will hold my daughter's interest for a long while.(nb: i may not be so excited if i'd paid $99, but at $15-30 i'm ecstatic)",Positive,Positive,0.22871716
"first the description:  you open it up, slip in the book --simple enough for my son (3 yrs old) to do himself, even changing the cartridge --  and switch it on, you are set! this is an incredible improvement over leappad and my first leappad for a totally self directed learning experience.  he has never ended up frustrated while using this toy.about the add-ons, i currently have two and he enjoys the i spy even though he is not in the recommended age group.  he is able to follow along anything it requires.  the volume slide is so nice and easy vs having to hit + and - symbols with a pen on the leappads. the blues clues one is for his age group and he loves that too.now for more comparisons:i own both the leap pad, and the my first leap pad for my now 3 year old son.  i would pass on that and go for this toy. after more than 1 1/2 years of owning them, i still need to pull them out for him, and watch over and remind him to hit the go circle etc.  in fact, he probably prefers a paper book to them, given that with normal 2- 3 yr old boy handling, the pen's contacts are iffy, and the pads shut off at random etc after just a few months of use.  i have to say, he does truly enjoy the dora, thomas, jay-jay, bob the builder, bear in the big blue house etc.  theme books for the leap pad / my first leap pad also.and as for leap pad plus, lets just say that the same go circle, and delicate pen problems still exist for a rambunctious boy :-) i do like the imagination desk, which does get him coloring and sounding out letters and words quite a bit, especially with pooh bear, or clifford.  wish they had a familiar character themed alphabet book too for that as well as the leap pad.  if you look at the parent complaining about a stray wrist making other stuff on the page sound out with the power touch, imagine a stray pen touch resetting the entire page to some other go circle.  much easier to teach them to point. at least, here the sounds relate to the page under view always.  i pull out the leap pad occasionaly if i have a sore throat and can't get through the dozens of books he likes for night time reading.  my son pulls out and plays with the power touch by himself.  enough said with that...",Positive,Positive,0.2252506
"i am a big fan of leapfrog products, so when i found out fisher-price had produced a reading system much like leapfrog's, i was a little skeptical.  after reading the reviews on the leappad, i decided to try the power touch for my 2-year-old who is constantly ""reading"" books to herself.  she loves it!  we purchased the blues clues book to go with it, and she already knows what outer space is after one night!  she calls it her purple computer, which can be carried around by the handle.  she is learning so much, and it has many activities to keep her busy.  we will be highly recommending this learning system to our friends' and familes' kids.",Positive,Positive,0.2404447
"like other parents, we have struggled between the powertouch and the leappad systems from leapfrog. after having owned a few of them now, this one is easily our favorite.pros:1. powertouch only requires that you buy one system. leappad has 3 different systems for the different ages of your child, so every few years you need to buy a new system to access the books for older children. powertouch has books ranging from ages 3 and up so you will only ever need one system.2. bigger books. leappad book pages are about half the size of powertouch books, and leappad books have a border around each page that significantly cuts down the active play area. if you've used the leappads before, you'll immediately appreciate powertouch's big, brightly colored pages.3. more activities. from our experience with the littletouch leappad and my first leappad, powertouch has tons more activities on every single page.4. no stylus. although my 2-year-old uses the stylus just fine (lots of practice from his magna doodle!) it is just easier and more natural for a toddler to use their fingers. not to mention the leappad stylus can actually leave black marks all over your books!5. volume control. the volume on the powertouch system is controlled by using a slider on the actual system, like most toys. the leappads require you to tap the + and - icons on the actual book pages and it gets really tedious really quickly and the taps don't always register.6. master on/off switch. powertouch has a switch on the back that you can turn off to prevent the system from accidentally turning on when bumped. leappads do not!7. books are easier to insert. powertouch books just slide right onto the system. the my first leappad especially is annoying for my toddler because you have to align the tabs on the system just right with the spirals of the book and he can't ever seem to get it on straight by himself.8. no ""go"" button! the ""go"" button on the littletouch leappad is silly. for the ages it's targetted at, those children probably won't understand the concept of touching ""go"" when they want to play on a new page. my son received a my first leappad at about 18 months old and picked up on the idea of the ""go"" button fairly quickly, but before he learned how to do it himself he would very frequently get frustrated because i'd have to stop him and use the stylus to push ""go"" for him. powertouch has sensors along the top edge that reads the page without having to push any buttons to advance the pages.9. durability. after only a few months with our my first leappad, it is behaving erratically. sometimes it reads the movements of the stylus, sometimes not. we don't really know what causes this, it just started acting crazy one day. my son takes very good care of his toys and has never broken any of his toys. our powertouch was given to us by a friend that had been handed down between several children! it is still working like new for us.cons:1. the system is bigger than the two smaller leappads, but it has a carrying handle and you can purchase a backpack. the larger size also allows for larger books, which means more activities for your child so i don't really see this as much of a con.so there is my rundown. we love fisher price and leapfrog toys so i am not biased towards one or the other, this is just an honest comparison and powertouch clearly wins in every category. i wish i would have purchased the powertouch in the first place! it's fantastic and my son loves it!!",Positive,Negative,0.6783582
"i bought this two years ago for my then 4 year old daughter. we chose it over leap pad because it didn't require the stylus, just the child's finger. she has spent countless hours with it and has learned an amazing amount from it. she still uses it almost daily. i am now using ebay to find additional books for her. i wish fisher price had stuck with this great product. unfortunately, (just as many years ago we chose sega over nintendo!!) we went with the product that lost out in the marketplace. everyone seems to have gone with leap pad. so while i think this product is excellent, it doesn't seem to be a good choice currently unles fp chooses to make more books.",Positive,Positive,0.08211714
"my son got this last year for christmas from my parents.  he loves it.  i actually like the power touch better than my first leap pad and leap pad because we have had to replace the pens on the leap pads and on the powertouch you don't have to worry about a pen, you use your finger.  its so amazing!  the only problem, their is'nt enough books out for the powertouch that my son really wants to play with.  he has 5 books for the powertouch, but he only plays with 2 of the books that he has.  i hope they come out with more books.  he wants jimmy neutron so santa might bring that for him.  if they ever get more books out, this is the best choice over the leap pad system.",Positive,Positive,0.24076624
"this is an excellent toy that allows a child to learn with or without a parent helping out.  my son (3 yrs old) has four books for this unit and they all read and count accurately and our unit has never frozen up on us.  my favorite thing about this toy - no green go circle!  i'm sorry, but reminding my son to ""press the green go circle"" every time he turned a page on his leappad jr was seriously annoying.  the powertouch, on the other hand, knows what page you are on automatically.  also, there is no stylus to worry about, the child simply presses words and pictures with his/her finger.  this product is far superior to the leappads.another thing i like about this system is the multitude of activities.  there are multiple counting, phonics, and game activities on almost every page.  also, when the system does not have a book in it, there is an alphabet with activities built right into the system.the unit has an easy on/off switch in the front that is easy for kids and a master on/off reset switch in the back.  it is easy for kiddos to open and close and use without help, so mom can have a bit of a rest (thank you fisher price!!).",Positive,Positive,0.045320358

"so my 17-month old is always underfoot in the kitchen, and keeps playing with the tupperware.  she's beginning to show the emergence of pretend play, so i thought that this would be a nice kitchen set that she could grown in to as she gets older.  boy, this set really does have everything ""except the sink""!  everything's packaged separately in the box it comes in, so nothing's loose and rattling around.  the bright primary colors immediately attracted my little one.  the set is marked ""ages 3+"" and i can see why -- there are small pieces, like the cookie cutters, and some of the saucers (for the teacups, i guess) are the size of chips ahoy cookies.  needless to say, i'll be storing those pieces away until she's older...and wants more pieces for her pretend play.  she especially likes the tea kettle and the saucepan -- i think the handles are the attraction -- they're just right for her little hands.  i also like that the set it easy to clean....i'm not sure if it's dishwasher safe, but i just hand wash them, it doesn't take a lot of time.  some of the cups survived a short drop from the kitchen table (she was playing before dinner was served) and no scratches or cracks on the toy or our hardwood floor.  i read other reviews that said this set is too expensive for what you get, and it's cheaply made, but i have to disagree.  the pots are a little on the small side to fit some of the play food she already has, but that's a minor thing -- we can adjust to that (and it'll be good for her problem-solving skills and spatial development).  i think it's a great buy, and even if it doesn't contain any play food, it helps her develop her imagination (and she's mimicking what i do in the kitchen), and keeps her busy where i can keep an eye on her as i cook.  i think it's a great buy!",Positive,Positive,0.051335685

"the math mat is kinda cool and my children (3.5 and 5.5 years of age) and i have been having fun playing with it since we got it for christmas.my daughter uses it to practice addition.  the math mat gives her an equation, such as `what is 2 + 8' on the ""easy"" level and she runs around and jumps on the usually correct number.  if you don't get the number correct, the mat tells you what the answer is.  and key to the math mat's success and popularity is that it always keeps a positive outlook.my 3.5 year old son on the other hand can't do equations so he plays at identifying the numbers.  the ""easy"" level on the mat is just that: identify the numbers from 0 to 10.  the more ""difficult"" level gives children a sequence of numbers for which they must give the missing number.  for example, the mat will say something like, `what number comes next"".  then it will say the sequence ""3, 4, _"" and your child has to come up with ""5"" for an answer.i foresee a slight lag problem where the mat might not get much use.  a toddler might have fun identifying their numbers, and a preschooler might have fun filling in the sequence, but there will probably be a gap in time before they progress to an age where they can do simple addition equations.  (then again, if they have the math mat maybe there won't be a gap.)four stars.  good educational fun.  toddlers and preschoolers will probably need parental help and motivation.the math mat takes 3 aa batteries.  to play you put the mat on the floor and then choose whether you want to do addition or subtraction or number identification.  it is all pretty intuitive and we haven't had to look at instructions.",Positive,Positive,0.030722007

"this is a great toy!  my son loves the math mat so much that when i challenge him to a game he shouts out the answers to the problems and occasionally tries to step on the buttons even when it's my turn to play!  this is a great toy for letting the kids run off some of their energy as they review their basic math skills.  my 5-year-old son runs around the mat as the computer voice says the equation and then he quickly runs to step on the answer.  the mat has three games (number identification and sequence, addition, and subtraction) and two levels of play.  regarding addition and subtraction, the first level requires you to find the sum or the difference and the second level gives you the answer to the problem and the first number in the equation and you provide the missing number.  we use level 1 as a warm up since it provides a good review and then we play level 2 for a challenge.i'd give this toy more than 5 stars in the fun and educational categories if i could.  since most children are quite active and learn math at different rates and since repetition is good at this stage, most children would get a lot of good quality use out of this game.  i think the durability is pretty good also but it's really too soon to know.",Positive,Positive,0.007289764

"very young toddlers to preschool age kids have played with the latches board we bought for our son, and they've all loved it!if anyone is worried that this will ""teach"" their child to open locks, my response to that is, this toy is so easy for kids to play with that they figure it out right away. the ease of use of this toy just proves that a child can undo a latch very easily, without being ""taught"" how to do it. if you lock doors in your home with a latch, you're going to have to put the latch out of the child's reach anyway, because it will be very easy for them to open it if they can reach it.  does anyone honestly think their child needs practice in order to learn how to flip these little locks from one side to the other? no, kids are much smarter than that, they already know how to do it.",Positive,Positive,0.1634832
"this ""latches"" board is great practice for problem-solving and manual dexterity/manipulation for toddlers/preschoolers.  i got this one mixed up with the ""locks"" board--much more complicated and for older children.  i caught the difference just before i purchased it, so i did end up with this one--the right one.  our 15-mo-old dtr. likes to fiddle with it for quite a while--she hasn't figured out all of the latches and needs a little help, but she also likes to look at the animals inside the doors.  our 3-yr-old likes to open/close the locks and doors, and it keeps his attention for several minutes (which is good considering his short attention span).  even our 5-yr-old will play with it a little, but i don't think it does much for him developmentally.  the only setback is that two of the latches are attached very tightly and so far, only the adults have been able to open those doors.  probably just a problem when it was made.  overall, a good developmental toy to have around the house.",Positive,Positive,0.35575652
"i'm still not quite sure how i feel about this product. my preschool students (4 years old) seem to really enjoy figuring out how to pop these latches. they do require a lot of assistance, however. be prepared to provide plenty of help. also, after a few months of pretty rough play, the latches are breaking. perhaps this product is intended solely for in-home use, and not for a preschool classroom.as for my 2-year-old...i am finding other ways to promote fine-moter development. i don't see the point in purposely teaching a toddler how to unlock latches and door chains. he has already had enough escape attempts, i don't need to encourage this sort of behavior.",Positive,Positive,0.20326862

"my daughter and i fell in love with the little people sets after she recieved melody the minivan for her birthday. since she loves all things involving animals we got her this little play zoo. the pieces are adorable and just the right size for infants and toddlers. this set comes with animals which when put in their cages make the appropriate animal sounds. the bird sits on top and plays a song which delights my daughter. this toy is not loud or annoying at all. it doesn't just go off as a reviewer noted. my daughter isn't aware of how to activate the sounds yet, with the exception of the bird's song. there is a monkey on a vine which hops up the vine when the lever next to him is depressed and he emits a springy sound. he is the only part that could be improved on. you have to hit the lever hard to get him to the top and he just pops up and down. i feel they could have made him swing instead or move more slowly so it seems as though he is really climbing. the figures are made of a rubbery material (as in rubber ducks) and my daughter loves to carry them around. they have now become her favorite bath toy. she just turned one and doesn't prentend play with them yet but she loves putting the pieces in different places and putting some of the animals in the minivan and the train which we also got for her. the zoo train is a wonderful addition to this set. the zookeeper and his car are by far her favorite part of this set. she always tosses the fish basket out and puts one of the other figurines in with him. she isn't able to fit the pieces in properly yet but that doesn't stop her from giving them a ride. most of the pieces usually get tossed around and we had to search for the zookeeper once. he got lost under the couch. since the pieces are easily washable i don't mind them getting tossed everywhere. my daughter plays with this every day and will point at it when she wants to play with it. it's the only toy so far that she points out. i believe this toy will get much more use as my daughter continues to develop and use the toy in different ways. also by adding a different set or different animals it seems as though it's a whole new toy. i fell in love with these toys since they aren't just noisemakers. most electronic toys recite things we want our children to learn but don't foster their imaginations. this toy definitely engages curious young minds and helps them relate to things that we do and see every day. fisher price is definitely an expert at challenging young minds.",Positive,Positive,0.26196074

"after reading these reviews, i rushed right out and bought this set for my 17 mo. old, who has recently developed an interest in sports and physical activities.  as a 10 yr. veteran preschool teacher,  i have never seen a toddler get interested in bowling, and my son was no different.  of all the toys--soccer goal, basketball, t-ball, this was the only one that he won't go near. i understand why this activity may not appeal to toddlers.  it simply takes too much time to set up all 6 pins,  then walk a distance and roll the ball,  only to have to set up all 6 pins again...over and over and over.  it's difficult for them to coordinate setting the pins up in the first place without knocking the others over and all of this simply takes too long for their short attention spans.  i am hoping that he will grow into it.  i am really disappointed that my son is not interested in this set,  especially since it was more costly than other ones i've seen. yet, i can't totally rate the set based on my son's lack of interest - as the pins are very durable, the bowling ball is the perfect size for little hands, and the internal balls inside the pins are a neat/unique addition.  just be warned:  although this toy is marketed for toddlers and called ""tot sports bowling set,"" older kids in the 3+ range will probably have more fun with it. if you would like to ""experiment"" to see if your toddler will be interested in bowling,  i highly recommend purchasing a much cheaper set before spending this much money.  on the other hand,  if you come from a family of bowlers and want to buy a durable set a little early and plan on spending hours with your kiddo practicing,  i highly recommend this one. hope this helps!",Positive,Negative,0.7356861

"the ocean wonders fishbowl was one of the first toys that caught my eye when i was buying christmas gifts for my now 10 month old daughter this year and i am so glad that we got it for her. i thought it was pretty and that the swimming fish would keep her attention and i am happy to see i was correct. she loves it and it has become her current favorite. ever since she was a month old she has enjoyed the toybar on the ocean wonders bouncer seat, so i was pretty sure she would like the fishbowl because of the water effects and the fish, but her favorite thing to do with the toy is to take the 3 flutter balls out and then put them back in again. she also seems to really enjoy the music and loves rocking the fishbowl to make it start playing.although the baby likes it a great deal, the music is the only reason i don't give this toy a perfect score- it can be a little bit annoying from the parental point of view. it is the same tune every time and the toy is very sensitive so it doesn't take much movement to set it off. i believe that in an earlier review someone complained that the toy was too sensitive and it would start playing if she just walked by it, and i agree that there have been times when i have set it off by just brushing the playpen on the way out of the room. but there is a volume control switch (high, low, and off) so it is very easy to change how loud the music is playing and even turn it off if it bothers you to much.music aside, i think that this is a wonderful toy for a small child and would recommmend it to all parents.",Positive,Positive,0.26177606

"my daughter enjoyed the ocean wonders aquarium in her crib so i decided to get the fish bowl for her to play with in her play yard. she was almost 6 months old and just starting to sit unassisted. the fishbowl was just the right size. it gave her something to hold onto and play with while sitting. after only a couple of days she was sitting for longer periods without falling over. first she was more interested in rocking the bowl and flipping it over to spill the balls out. at 7 months she started rolling the balls and we could pass them back and forth on the floor. i've made a game of trying to make the fish and the sea shell spin inside the flutter balls. i enjoy playing with this toy as much as the baby does. i like to spin the bowl around clockwise to shake the glitter up and make the fish swim by. when i first saw this toy i thought it was only good for was practicing hand-eye coordination by taking the balls out and putting them back in, but there's so much more to it. it lights up and plays cute little water sound effects and music, but even when it's turned off it's still pretty exciting (which is good since my daughter likes to flip it over and turn off the switch on the bottom.) imaginative minds can find many different ways to play with this toy so it's definitely one children can enjoy for years to come.",Positive,Positive,0.3579863
"we bought this toy when our son was 16 months and our daughter was 4 months old. they both got a lot of use out of it. my son has developmental delays and it helped him a lot with some of his goals. my daughter loved to pat at it and when it'd make noise, she'd shreek with glee!it teaches cause and effect - take the ball put in the bowl see/hear the effect of it. very good! also teaches that the child can make something do something cool without hardly trying.would definatly recommend to anyone!",Positive,Positive,0.16422854
"santa brought this toy for my nine month old daughter, and she loves it, and so do i!  the small balls are the right size for her to hold on to (one in each hand banging them together, usually!) and the music is soft &amp; pleasant.  my daughter is at the perfect age for this toy- she's just figuring out how to put and take, and she loves watching the balls roll around inside the bowl.  i highly recommend this toy!",Positive,Positive,0.0026039307
"we bought this for our son when he was about 6 months old and he loved it from the start.  when he was younger he would bat or kick at it and make the music come on and he would watch the fish swim around.  as he got older he discovered the flutter balls.  he loves putting them in the bowl and then taking them out.  (this is great for fine motor skill development.)  he also discovered that if he shook the balls or rolled them across the floor that the object inside moved.  he is now almost 15 months old and this remains a favorite toy.  we had purchased another fish bowl toy (soft style) and he showed no interest.this item is also very durable. our son carries it around and drops it on our hard wood floors.  he also turns it over and bangs on it like a drum.  it is still working great!unlike other musical toys, the sounds and music from this item are pleasant, even to adults.  it makes water sounds and has a musical song with a calypso like flair.we have had several other children over our house and this fishbowl attracts them all.  after visiting, several of the parents have purchased a fish bowl of their own upon seeing their child's enthusiasm for the toy.",Positive,Positive,0.12969708

"my 8 mo son loves the lights and sounds, and it's helping him learn that things can be taken out of things. the first thing he did when i gave it to him was reach in and pull out one of the balls. then he pushed the whole bowl over to spill out the other two. it's helping him figure this whole ""sitting up"" thing as well, so he can reach in easier. stealth-learning - i'm all for it.",Positive,Positive,0.0832902

"i received this toy for my daughter's baby shower.  it has been in her crib since birth, but didn't get any use until she was about four months old.  until she was four months when she would wake up in the mornings she would immediately cry until we would come to get her.  one morning when i was getting ready for work i heard music coming from her monitor.  she had figured out how to turn on the music!  since she has figured it out she now keeps herself entertained until we can get to her in the mornings.  also, we hear her playing it in the middle of the night sometimes.  it has been a great way for me and my husband to get the extra sleep we need.  i have been thrilled that she has found a way to entertain herself!  now i don't have to worry about having enough time to get ready for work, because she plays the music, it gives me that extra 15 minutes to finish getting ready in the morning.  i would highly recommend this to anyone!",Positive,Positive,0.061167
i purchased this when i was pregnant only because i wanted everything with the aquarium theme! but boy when my son was born i realized it was all worth it! he would't fall asleep unless this was on and he could see the light! only thing i didn't like much was that my son wanted it on all night and the batteries would die about every week so just in case keep extra batteries on hand for this one!,Positive,Negative,0.5368297
"i just received this for my daughter for christmas.  i already have a gloworms one that i received for a babyshower gift which is one of the greatest gifts i had received.  since the batteries are almost dead, i picked this up from my father-in-laws and decided to put it on the other side of the crib.  she's 8 months (7 weeks early) and already hits it on and off which is amusing.  i personally find the bubble sounds too loud, and that there's not much of a variation to look at compared to the gloworms one i have since it rotates and has a bunch of different songs.  the music doesn't seem to last as long on here either but i like the music since it is soothing and relaxing as well.so far she likes it but that's all i can really review on now seeing as how i just set it up now.  i also like how you can just hear the water if you want to.i recommend the use of this with the gloworms but between the two, i'd stick with the gloworms due to more things to see, longer music time and a wider variety of music.a great gift for anyone though if it's your style!",Positive,Positive,0.44658995
"this has been one of our favorite baby products.  my son loved it from day one.  now that he is eight months old, i can put him in the crib awake and he knows when the music turns off, it is time to go to sleep.  when he wakes up in the morning, he will turn it on himself and will amuse himself for a few minutes.the only reason i gave it four stars instead of five is even on the lowest setting, the music is a little loud.  now that i had to lower the crib mattress, i had to put the aquarium on the bottom and my son bumps into it in his sleep and turns it on.  no way around this and its not too much of a problem, but sometimes it does wake him up and makes him cry.  i still wouldn't consider taking it out or moving it out of reach.",Positive,Positive,0.29094797

"we used this first for my son when he was a newborn, and the sounds seemed to stimulate, more than they relaxed him.  later, when he was learning how to pull up, he got plenty of bruises on his head from falling on the aquarium.  even now,  at 1 year-old,  he gets excited,  looses his balance, and bangs his head.  every time he does this, i take it out, then change my mind, and affix it back to the crib.  this aquarium offers different settings: you can turn the lights off and on,  simply play the various soothing melodies, or set the option that stimulates the aquarium/water while the melody plays with the fish moving.  it even inclues a volume feature.  however,  there are some drawbacks.  it is designed to hang on the top of the crib as most all crib toys are. yet, it's hard for babies to see the fish once you lower the mattress.  for my son,  the result of it being attached so high is he stands up to see the visuals - which defeats the purpose of this being a night-time soother.  if you opt to affix it at their eye level at the bottom of the crib,  babies (5 or even 6 mos of age) can use it as a stool to climb in, around, and out of the crib.  for these reasons, and the bruises noted above,  i've recently opted to keep it out.  the aquarium is now placed on a table near his rocker,  and we sometimes play it while we rock him for the last bottle of the night.  i'm tired of moving it around and trying to find a safe place for it.  i wanted to love this aquarium...i had prepared myself to do,  but it just didn't work for us.  i wish the makers had cushioned the edges and made the screen bigger.  final recommendation: try it out.  it may work well for your little one as it did for so many reviewers here.  the price is not bad at all.",Positive,Positive,0.2894845

"my daughter received this for christmas when she was 4 months old, and the first time we turned it on for her it kind of freaked her out and we turned it off.  a couple weeks later we gave it another try and she's loved it ever since.  in the past she would thrash and cry on the occassions when we'd put her to bed wide awake.  but now we turn the aquarium on and she becomes mesmerized.  the music, lights, bubbles and swimming fish really mellow her out.  even the motor sound seems to soothe her.  i only wish the toy could hang lower so she could reach it while laying on her back.  now, as soon as we lower the side of her crib in the morning, and the aquarium lowers with it, she hits the button to start it.  also, there is a clam that opens and closes when a little ball is spun, but it is barely noticable and just not very exciting.update: 9 months have passed since i first wrote my review, and during that time my daughter learned to stand up and manipulate things with her hands.  one morning we woke to hear her aquariuim blarring loudly.  she had cranked the volume all the way up and pressed the play button, and the loudness scared her and us.  now we keep the aquarium on her crib with the batteries removed, so she can still play with the non-powered parts.  i still feel this toy is good for little babies, but it would be better for big babies if the volume control were completely out of their reach.",Positive,Negative,0.7621375

"this was my second favorite item i received for my son (after his ""kick and play bouncer"").  it was right up there because it was a god send in soothing my son and giving me some peace and quiet to go do a task or even just relax knowing his attention was occupied by something and not focused on wanting mommy!this item is beyond cute.  when he first got it as a newborn, the songs played the most important role.  and being able to choose between three different ones was good.  it was not too repetitive or boring.  when he became more alert, he would be able to lay on his back for hours just gazing at the dim lights flickering on and off and at the fishies and bubbles.  now at 9-months-old we put him in his crib sitting and he goes at it.  he's wild with glee watching it and hitting the toys on it.  the songs still sooth him to sleep--this is a much better investment that a mobile for the muscial factor and also much better for keeping their attention.  he's also able to turn it off and on himself and that's great because it's like an additional toy for him with a ""reward"" because it's a big flat button that goes along the bottom.  you just press it on and off.  (there is also of course a regular button to use to turn it completely off.)this product was very easy to attach to the crib and also easy to wipe down.  i absolutely love it.  it has three different ""settings"" so let's say you don't want the music but just the bubbles/lights you can do that.  or you can have just the music so the sound of the bubbles is not heard.  very versatile; excellent product.",Positive,Positive,0.1515474

"my daughter received this as a present when she was first born, she's 2 years old now and we still play the music for her every night when she goes to sleep.  it has an automatic shut-off so it turns itself off after about 5mins or so.  it has different songs, sounds and it has volume control.  you can also turn the lights on and off so if baby only likes music or vice versa.  this is definitely worth the money.",Positive,Positive,0.02236315
"i really was excited when i saw the commercial for this product. i rushed out and bought it for my new baby. fisher price would have a complete winner if they would make only two minor changes!first of all, the button to turn it on and off is right between two ""toys"" on the aquarium. the on/off feature should be in the back with the rest of the controls.secondly, the motor is way too loud! i'm sure technology allows for a much more quiet motor.i would gladly pay [amt] more for this product if it included these two changes. i was completely satisfied with the choices of music and sounds. the songs are better, more modern versions of traditional nursery songs. the sounds of the ocean and waves are cool, but sort of drowned out by the motor. you have to turn the sound up pretty loud to drown out the noise of the motor. the lights could be a tad bit brighter.even with the few flaws, this product is still great. i hope someone from fisher price reads this review and makes the changes soon.",Positive,Negative,0.8714852

"this one is a favorite because:1. parents (and older babies and toddlers) can choose from several options, depending on how much activity or quiet is desired. at naptime, parents may opt to have only the music play, soothing baby to sleep. at playtime, the toy can be set so that the fish ""swim, bubbles go up through the water and music or the sound of bubbling water plays.2. the music is absolutely delightful, not that awful, tinny music that so many toys have. it really sounds like there is an orchestra inside the toy, fostering an early appreciation of good music. there are 3 tunes as well as the sound of bubbling water for those times when music isn't preferred. the music is soothing, gentle and lovely to listen to.3. young babies can simply watch the fish swim and listen to the music. as they get older, they can interact with the toy, pressing buttons or rolling a ball to make a clam open and close its mouth - or a starfish spin. delightful!4. the toy is sturdy, having survived several falls without a single crack, as well it should (since it is for babies).a lovely addition to any nursery!",Positive,Positive,0.25923944

"my daughter loves this thing. we have had it in her crib for many months. we used to turn it on to settle her for sleep, and she figured out how to turn it off and on herself. she just recently figured out how to  change the music settings. she will sometimes turn it on and fall asleep to it, and sometimes turns it on when she wakes up to relax in her crib for awhile (she is 15 months). i highly recommend it. the tunes it play are nice and not too tinny like some electric toys. it doesn't drive me nuts when i hear it through the monitor. i find myself humming the tune during the day sometimes!.",Positive,Positive,0.0015880233
"this toy was a life saver when my daughter was an infant.  we would set it to the different aquarium sounds (rain, waves, etc.) without the lights when putting her in her crib at night.  it was soothing and comforting.  when we wanted her to just relax, we would add the lights and she was mesmerized.  the timer function is only about 10 mins or even less so sometimes i would have to sneak in and re-start it.  when she turned about 5 months old, she figured out how to turn it on and off so it actually became a distraction to her in the crib (she would become alert turning it on and off) so we had to take it out.  we had one of those octogonal shaped play-yards in the house and we attached it to that for play time.  personally i preferred the aquarium sounds to the music - the music is very new-agey.  but my aughter seemed to like the music and that's what's important.  only one caveat - we have an italian made crib and rails are all thin, we had a tough time securing it tightly.",Positive,Positive,0.110863894

"there are not too many toys to choose for crib entertainment that offer both night time and day time stimulation.  we original received an aquarium for each crib (we have triplets).  we returned one thinking that we would buy a different ones so we could rotate the toys between the three cribs.  we bought a leap pad touch and tug discovery book, but it is only good for day time play.  no lights.  so we ended up with 2 aquariums and one touch and tug book and have not been disappointed.the aquarium gives your child a soothing way to fall asleep and when he awakes whether it be from a nap during the day or at night, he can activate the aquarium and put him self back to sleep or entertain him self.it straps on to the side of the crib and had some height adjustment.  it does not hang near the bottom of the crib, it is more of a top rail toy.you can set the aquarium to do many different things.  the best thing is that it does have volume adjustment.  you can set it to soft or loud.  i believe that there is 4 different song settings, river flowing, raining and waves.  you can also have bubbles and lights or none.  it allows you to choose what you want, whether it just be lights and no bubbles or bubbles and no lights.when my boys are having a bad night, i set it to one of the water sounds and that usually soothes them to sleep.as your child gets older he will be able to interact with it more.  there is the large push button in the front that allows the child to turn it on and off.  this was a very exciting night when my son learned how to turn it on and off.  of course all night long we had to listen to it go on and off, no very soothing, but entertaining.  there is a little level on the right side that when they pull it down it makes the star fish spin.  there is a ball on the left side that when they roll it the clam opens his mouth to revel a pearl.now that my babies can stand they love playing with the switches and dials in the back.  we never know what will happen when they turn it on later.this a great toy for the crib.  it combines music and lights to create a soothing environment.",Positive,Positive,0.16483045
"we bought this item on a friend's recommendation and were not disappointed.  the ocean wonders aquarium is great for ages birth to one year+ because it offers soothing music (a nice selection of three tunes in very mellow chords) as well as optional muted lights and bubbles.  the only criticism we had is that the fish and other aquatic inhabitants in the box make a racket and you cannot turn them off like you can the music and lights; it's a though you are forced to listen to the plastic motion of the pieces over the soothing sounds of ocean waves, bubbles and/or music.  the price is about right for a crib toy and it's a sturdy unit so don't worry about breakage if your little one reaches out to touch.",Positive,Positive,0.20316917

"okay, i have to say that this was actually the best toy for our child for her first year.  she loved the music, and sounds when she was a tiny infant.  when she got a little older, she started to learn how to push the buttons, and get music/sounds, or just watch the characters/bubbles move.  it got to the point that we were able to move the baby out of our room by the time she was 5 months old because, when she woke up - instead of crying, she would play with this toy, and that would tell us she was awake.the music is soothing, and our daughter loves the music (but it also has sounds - all are very soothing).  when she wakes up in the middle of the night, she plays with this, and puts herself back to sleep.  i would recommend putting this in the crib as soon as you can, so the child can get used to it.  and then when they can sleep on their stomach, encourage/play with the toy with them.our daughter is now almost a year old, and she still loves that toy.  it is very sturdy, and i really don't have any complaints.  the only reason why i gave 4 stars for education was because, it really just teachers her cause & effect.the only thing that i can think that i would warn people of is that once your child gets older, and starts to pull up, they will fiddle with the controls on the top, and may make the volume a little louder than what you would want the next time they hit the on switch.  so make sure you turn it down before you put them to bed at night.",Positive,Positive,0.1335671
this toy has a hypnotic effect on your little one. my only regret is that we didn't start using it until my daughter was about 4 mos. it is perfect when you need to distract your infant for just a few moments while you wash your hands or get bath supplies together. it will stop tears flowing instantly.  when she wakes up i hear her prattling with the toys (she hasn't learned how to start the music herself yet). she is now 6 mos and it still works like a charm. definitely a crib toy worth purchasing.,Positive,Positive,0.010910851
i wrote a review 12/18/02 about this toy the night i bought it. i now want to say that it is definately worth it. i don't know what people r saying about it that r bad but it is one of the best items i have bought for my son. i have had it now for almost 2 months and use it up to three times a night and haven't had to change the batteries yet!!!!! i do agree that i wish the bubbling played longer than 5 mins. because my son loves that setting more than the others but most of the time he is asleep by the time it goes off. the motor is not too loud at all either. i am glad i didn't listen to most of these bad reviews about it and finally bought it.,Positive,Positive,0.11948522

"i read so many glowing reviews that talk about this toy like it's magic. i was surprized to see so many negative reviews here. then i looked at the dates and noticed they were all written almost a year ago. i guess that was around the time fp stopped making peaceful planet and many of the reviewers were disappointed that ocean wonders was different. well i've never had any other aquarium toy, so my review is based solely on my experience with ocean wonders. i was first drawn to it because i needed to keep my daughter entertained in her crib, but i didn't want her to have to lay on her back to look up at a mobile. i wanted something she could see on her side and during tummy time. this is exactly what i was looking for. unlike a mobile, it doesn't have to be removed once the baby can reach it. there are little levers for the baby to play with, even an on/off button. there is also an on/off swith in the back where the baby can't reach, along with volume control and settings. you can choose from 3 different water sound effects and 3 seperate songs or a medley of all 3 songs. you can also watch bubbles and moving fish or keep the motor off and just play sound with or without lights. the soothing sound effects have helped lull my baby to sleep. the bubbles and music have kept her distracted while i left the room and the lever and button are always there when she's ready to reach up and play. i don't know what i would have done without this toy. we use it daily. i'll always remember the first time i played it for her. she looked at it in awe, then looked at me as if to say 'thank you mommy'. i'm so glad i bought it for her.",Positive,Positive,0.48401102
everything is fabulous about the ocean wonders except the time it runs.  it runs only for about 5 minutes and often it takes my 5 mo old son longer to fall asleep.  i wish it had an option to run longer so i don't have to continually return to his nursery to push the restart button.,Positive,Negative,0.91524535

"my daughter has had the ocean wonders aquarium for over a year now and she loves it just as much as i do.  when she was only a few months old, it was the only thing that would put her to sleep.  the volume, sounds (music and effects) and light/bubble controls are behind the front display (but easy for parents to get to) so curious cruisers are pretty much unable to adjust them.  there are several different settings available; for example, music with lights and no bubbles  or  water sounds with just lights.other than a blanket, i keep toys out of her crib, so i like that this aquarium hangs safely out of harms way from the crib rails.  now when i put her down for naps, she's not alone sitting there with only her blanket; if she needs a few minutes before she's ready to sleep, i hear her hit the large blue button on the front of the aquarium and music starts to play.  she is able to turn it on all on her own and she watches/listens until she falls asleep.  that's also how i know if she's awake from her nap.  through the monitor, i hear that soft music and i know my little girl is ready to play!this is truly such a blessing - it's entertaining, lulling and nice to look at.  she hardly ever fusses before naps and i know this aquarium is to thank.  instead of crying to get out of her crib, my daughter is able to calm herself at the push of a button!",Positive,Positive,0.23665245

(my daughter is in the organ stage now)there are a few things i didn't find necessary in this toy.  1)  the rocking- my daughter never wanted to rock when she was on this toy.  in music mode, she would sometimes dance, but never on the piano.  2) the option to switch musicd modes (violin, flute, etc)  my daughter never had any interest in this.  they all sound pretty much the same, and they are tinny at best.  this is not even close to an accurate interpretation to what these instruments sound like.  they should stick with organ/piano.one wish for me was that they would have interchangable disks of different music- even i get tired of these same songs.all in all, i think all children should be exposed to music, and some way of playing it, and that's why i think this toy is worth having in your childs collection.",Positive,Positive,0.40214035

"carcassonne was my gateway into the eurogame world.  i had played settlers of catan a few times before, but carcassonne was the one that really got me hooked.gameplay is very simple.  starting with one starting tile (or a 12-tile river which is now included in new editions of the game, whichever players choose), players take turns drawing a random tile and placing it in such a way that it fits seamlessly with other tiles that are already placed.  on his/her turn, a player can also place a piece--they're affectionately known as meeple--onto a feature (road, city, cloister or farm) on the tile just placed.  a player can't place a meeple on a feature that already has another meeple on it, but a two features each with their own meeple can be connected by subsequent tile placement, and that's where things really start to get hairy.carcassonne is a nice game because there's a lot of strategy involved, and a lot of ways in which forethought pays off, but there's not a lot of ways in which it's overtly aggressive.  there's no way to remove another player's meeple from the map (unless you're playing with one of the expansions that allows that), and a good working knowledge of how many of each type of tile is available can be very, very helpful.one caveat: you'll need a lot of space to play this game.  as there's no set size for the landscape, you may find it reaching out surprisingly far in many directions.other than that, i've got nothing negative to say about carcassonne.  it's fun for kids and adults, easy to pick up, and gameplay time using just the base game is usually pretty short (30-40 minutes).  enjoy!",Positive,Positive,0.01828644

"carcassonne is a game that has stood the test of time in my collection.  i've had this for probably 6 years or so, yet my wife and i still have fun every time we take this game out.  i've never been much on tile-laying games until i played this one.the version i bought included the first `river' expansion with it, so we've always used that to start the game.  the game is easy to learn (though scoring the farmers takes some getting used to).  you lay down a tile that has one or more features on it (city, farmland, roads, cloisters), and you can place a meeple (wooden people) on any one feature on that tile to claim it as your own, providing that it doesn't  connect to an entity that already has another meeple on it (i.e. you can't claim a road if somebody already has a meeple on it).  when an entity is completed, the meeple is removed and the owner receives points for the completed entity.  the game ends when the last tile is placed, then the final scoring takes place.the game plays from 2 to 5 players (6 players if you buy the inns and cathedrals expansion), and scales fairly well.  the tiles are sturdy  and colorful, and the meeples stand out nicely when placed on them.  it's pretty cool to stand back and look at the map you've created when the game is done, too.one of the best things about carcassonne is the many expansions that are available.  they let you add different elements to the game that tweak the rules a bit to add layers of strategy without making the game too difficult.  these range in size and price, and each one adds a slightly different twist to an already-excellent game.",Positive,Positive,0.0039823474

"sometimes you can feel the hype surrounding a game long before you ever play it.  such was the case with carcassonne, a staple among rio grande's catalog since the year 2000 and a game that has spawned literally dozens of expansions and spin-offs.  if all of these facts weren't quite enough to hint toward a winner, the game comes decorated with a host of awards it managed to earn along its storied decade of existence.written originally by klaus-jurgen wrede, carcassonne originally came into being in germany by a firm called hans im gluck and like most rio grande games, was translated into english and reintroduced to the north american market shortly thereafter.  the illustration credit goes to doris matthaus and jay tummelson rounds out the roster as the man behind the english translation.consisting merely of 84 cardboard land tiles, a single cardboard scoring track, 40 wooden pawns and a color rule sheet, i wasn't sure what to expect going in.  it turns out that the reason for the game's near-legendary status among hardcore fans and casual gamers alike has more to do with simplicity in its game mechanics and a highly addictive formula that's nearly subliminal to learn but limited only to the imaginations of the players involved.the system, which is deceptively simple, works like this: players begin by shuffling then stacking the 83 land tiles then place the start tile in the center of the table. they then take turns drawing a tile from the stack and placing it immediately, in other words, no one ever has tiles in their hand.  laying the tiles is quite intuitive in nature as the only rules to follow are to make sure the roads connect.  the strategy comes in the form of the scoring mechanic, which is derived at by when and where a player decides to place his pawns.  pieces in the city segments are labeled knights and score 2 points per tile, pieces on the roads become thieves and earn a single point per tile.  pawns placed in the cloister (monks) can earn 9 points and farmers can make oodles of points depending on how many nearby cities they supply with goods.about the trickiest part is of course learning the scoring method/ point breakdowns (some pieces are scored immediately then the pawns returned to the player's inventory while others, like the farmers, aren't scored until the end of the round).  the game comes to its conclusion once all of the tile pieces have been placed.  since there is an east-to-follow scoring card included, the need for a calculator or scratch paper is pretty much eliminated entirely.rounds take around 45 minutes but that time seems to decrease to closer to a half hour as players get into the swing of things.  the recommended requirement of ages 8 and up seems pretty on par but, and as i've discovered is the case with many games, much of this has to do with the way the rules are presented in the book/ grasping the game for the first time.  it would appear that teaching the game to others once an adult has a firm grasp on it could very well open up the game's playability to children of nearly all ages as the mechanics are brilliantly simplistic.the art itself is nothing too fancy or elaborate, which most certainly contributes to the game's user-friendly charm.  pieces are all easy to identify and it really doesn't take long before the table is just completely occupied by sprawling cities and villages.  an additional bonus to tile-laying games like this is that it is literally a new game each and every time it is played.  since there is no permanent game board, there are no patterns to learn or unfair advantages for veteran players over beginners.in all, i find the game to be quite enjoyable and almost relaxing in its mechanic.  never does it feel like a direct competition between players so much as an opportunity to create various landscapes while earning points in the process.  while the core game supports 2-5 players, this is one of few titles that can truly boast intuitive couple-play.  in other words, playing with just one other person never feels like a scaled down version of the ""real"" experience.like so many timeless classic board games before it, carcassonne's greatest strength and most enduring attribute would have to be its clever simplicity.  it can be enjoyed by players of nearly any age and level of experience, doesn't grow old quickly, and offers up enough strategy to keep players coming back for more.  it's hard to imagine a more successful formula than that!",Positive,Positive,0.11084547
"germany delivers again with a very enjoyable--yet highly strategic--board game. assorted tiles about 40 in number can be drawn by two to five players from a box. the player then connects the tile to the main board, where the depictions of grass, castle and road drawings must correspond to other adjacent tiles. once a tile is placed, the player may place a piece on the board, and these men help the player garnish points through completing streets, castles, monasteries or fields. the fun of the game involves the luck of the draw and the strategy of whether to build up your creations or make it difficult for the other participating players.my wife and i laid the foundation for our relationship while playing this game during our courtship, and we continue to play in our marriage. we rate carcassonne among the board game titans of settlers of catan and scrabble.",Positive,Positive,0.0031433231

"this is a tile-placement game.  square tiles have roads, monasteries, cities and farmland printed on them.  each player in turn reveals a tile and places it such that all edges match edges already placed.  for instance, a road has to connect to a road, it can not just stop.  once a player places a tile, they can claim part of the tile (road, farmland, city, or monastery).  as these features grow the player gets more points.  monasteries do not grow, points are gained by filling in the nine surrounding spaces.the skill comes from knowing just what to claim.  each player has a limited number of claim tokens.  once a feature is completed (road, city or monastery), the points are collected and the claim token becomes available for use again.  players must balance their use of the tokens and work to complete features so they can claim even more.  one trick is to complete a short road or small city (just two tiles, sometimes three) and then claim it, thus getting the points and getting the claim token back immediately.this is a quick game.  playing time is relatively short (thirty minutes or so) and play is easy.  no two games are ever the same thus keeping the game fresh.  a fun game for two to six players.  the game is reasonably small and easy to transport.  pieces are cardboard tiles and wooden claim tokens.  if you are looking for a fun game that doesn't take hours, then this one might be for you.",Positive,Positive,0.038953904
"carcasonne - a cool strategy card laying game - succeeds brilliantly because of its simplicity, strategic depth, and atmospheric beauty.  game play is simple - a river is laid out creating the start for a growing medieval world of fields, roads, rivers, monasteries, and fortified cities.  these features are on the playing cards the players lay down as tiles.  as the game progresses the area of tiled cards grows, painting a medieval landscape in front of you.you have a limited number of playing pieces which you use to take possession of roads, cities, monasteries, or fields for farming as you play your cards.  you get points for completing these items - and whether you complete them depends on the cards you draw - and also on the choices other players make when tiling down their cards.  when an item is completed you get your playing piece back and can use it to take possession of new features on the next card you lay down.  where and how you put cards down is constrained by the features of the card, and what's already been played.  for example you must play a card with road on it only if there's already road - or a road terminus adjacent (no hanging roads - or cities).  you work alone, but also sometimes in cooperation with other players (it's possible for two player's cities to merge in to one, then it benefits you both if you finish).  farming is complicated - but it's about controlling areas of contiguous field.  since the field areas are being created as the cards are laid down - there's an element of chance as well as strategy.  the cards themselves are simple yet pretty and atmospheric.  the game play is cutthroat - yet the visuals of pretty fortified medieval cities and fields, roads and streams is serene and soothing.  this combination of attributes is compelling.  this is a really fun game that gets the juices flowing.as others have noted, except for farming, the rules are simple and kids can play (i'd say kids 8 and up).  this game is sophisticated enough for even jaded gaming adults too.  it's a great family game, and great thing to bring on weekend retreats (because it's quiet and non-electric).  it's  got fantastic replay value too.",Positive,Positive,0.0030384967
"this is a fun game for kids and adults alike. it's a bit more complicated than your ""classic"" (monopoly, not chess) board game, but the strategy and interaction that this complication enables makes this game a winner.the basic gameplay is simple: several tiles are turned face down, with some number of tiles turned up. on your turn, you pick up a face down tile, turn it face up, and place it next to any face up piece. then you must decide if you want to claim a particular section of that tile (the field, or the road, or the city, or the church). claiming a section can earn you points, but you only have a limited number of men to use! each section on a piece is essentially an investment with some amount of risk. road are fairly low risk, with a fairly low investment time, but also a typically low payout. cities are a higher risk, with higher payout, but a longer investment time. churches and fields have their own risk vs reward as well.overall, a fun game, lasting about 45 minutes per session. typical turn lenths are about 10-20 seconds long, and the limited number of expansions that i've tried have been nice additions as well. great for both casual gamers and lighter fare for more serious gamers.",Positive,Positive,0.015055952

"if you've played carcassonne, chances are you loved it. that means you've played it again and again. after a while, the game might start to bore you. that's what expansions are for! this one is a small expansion, with just a few new tiles that add a few rules to the game, along with some blank pieces so you can create your own tiles.the cult part refers to a tile that is used just like the monasteries of the original game, but when placed alongside a monastery it becomes a race to see who can finish it first and claim all the points.the siege part comes in four pieces that can be used to reduce the value of a castle when used on it. the castle is worth just 1 point per tile but if finished and has a farmer in it, it's worth an extra point at that time.if you have a chance to get this expansion, i suggest you buy it, it's one of the less common ones and adds a nice bit of variety to the game.",Positive,Positive,0.2953951
"carcassonne: 2-5 players, ages 8+, average play time = 60 minutesi was very surprised by how much this game grew on me. at first, i was skeptical by the fact that you didn&#8217;t have a hand and were at the mercy of whatever tile you drew. in the beginning of the game, you won&#8217;t have that many choices in terms of placement, but towards the end, you&#8217;ll be trying to screw up your opponent&#8217;s scoring chances while trying to resolve your own.keeping along those lines, i personally enjoyed how strategic the game turned out to be. i was constantly thinking of ways to extend my son&#8217;s city (the one he had a follower on) so that he&#8217;d never be able to complete it. he&#8217;d still earn one point per city tile at game end, but that was significantly less than the two points per tile he could have earned.resisting the urge to place all of my followers in the beginning became a real challenge. i saw a lot of potential fields that future cities might connect to, but i had to make sure i had enough in reserve to score on the more immediate opportunities. since you and your opponent are limited to how many followers you have, it becomes a battle of wits to see who claims what first and who is able to save enough for when it counts.out of all of the game mechanics, the scoring was the hardest for me to pick up on. at times, i was scratching my head on how farmers scored and what fields were considered theirs. once you overcome this initial learning curve, play is relatively fluid. luckily, the manual is fairly easy to understand when trying to put it all together.i should also mention that this game has a ton of expansions, which shoots up this game&#8217;s replay value tenfold. it seems like there is always something new to keep the game fresh and interesting. not all of the expansions will appeal to everyone, but having the option alone is a plus in my book.carcassonne is a great game to introduce to players that are new to the wonderful world of board games, especially if you have an experienced player on hand to help with the scoring and flow of play. it&#8217;s also a great game for players of all ages (within reason), so if you are in the market for something relatively easy that provides a fair amount of depth, then you may want to look into this game further.",Positive,Positive,0.06295069

"this is another huge hit in my house.  the age guideline says 10 and up, but my 6 and 9 year old love this game.  we got it this past summer and my son played it at 5.5 yrs. old without trouble.  i was even surprised that he totally understood the strategy in the game when he would put pieces down.it is a fairly complex game to learn the first few times you play.  if we haven't played it for a few weeks i'll pull out the instructions again to refresh myself.  it also has a quick-reference sheet which is very handy.  however once you learn it it's not as complicated as it originally seemed.  to make it easier at first, play without the river pieces.  my son doesn't need help at all to play.the tiles are quite thick and sturdy and the men are wood so very durable, however like any game, you'll want to be careful not to lose the pieces as there are a lot.we also bought the traders and builders add-on that adds more tiles, more people to play with, and some new twists on the game.  my kids like the add-on as well, and the bag for the tiles that came with it is very good to have to plop all the pieces in to prevent peeking or losing the tiles.",Positive,Positive,0.0066492804
"carcassonne is a pure strategy game. no dice, not much luck involved, and the board is never the same because the players build it as you go along. essentially you are building cities and roads one piece at a time and have a limited number of tokens (""meeples"") with which to 'claim' them as you lay them down. once you've claimed a build in progress no one else can, although two 'claimed' items in progress can be built into each other and cause it to be split or even stolen from the player with more meeples in it.there are other things to claim like fields and abbeys and there are a great number of expansions. i'd recommend inns and cathedrals and also traders and builders and get your hands on the ""river ii"". there are large box sets combining many of these, but do your research and make sure you're getting a good deal by buying one of those first... sometimes you are better off trying the base game, then reading how the various expansions work and adding them in.the only luck involved with the game is when you draw the piece you will be trying to lay each round. if you play your meeples wisely it will be unusual you have a tile that is of no use to you. however, even if you do draw a useless tile you can sometimes use it to 'block' another players efforts. (after the ""river"" tiles are played i'd recommend having players draw a tile at the end of their turn rather than the start so that they can be thinking about where to place it while others are placing there - it'll move the game along a little quicker).i enjoy carcassonne more than settlers of catan because carcassonne is more versatile in layout and you aren't rolling dice to get your points. you build an item, which gives you point if unfinished at the end of the game, or you get points for (sometimes more as a result of) finishing something you are building (at which point you get your meeple back to place on a new tile, thereby giving you the chance to make more points before the game ends).the game pieces are good quality. they are not going to bend or break without a lot of effort. i suspect you'll eventually see a little wear on their surfaces if you are rough with them. if you become a big fan, or you just like to customize your games a bit, check out a online store called ""meeple source"" as they have a lot of cool game tokens for carcassonne (and other games).there's also nothing stopping you from making your own game pieces. if you want some interesting alternate pieces or want to inject something new into the game there's no reason you can't go get some (very) heavy card stock and create your own add on's.there is an ap version of this game you might want to try out to see if you're like it. the android version is only the basic game with the river ii expansion, pretty simple. the iphone/ipad version is far more robust and includes many of the expansions.",Positive,Positive,0.34321594

"i am glad that i bought this game.  it does not involve any money or any pen and paper (which is rather unusual!)  scoring is done by moving people around a 50 point track, and if you lap it, you get a 50 point card in addition to whatever else you have on the point track.  this keeps the focus on the game-play, while still allowing for a point reference throughout the game.the pieces (and the box) are of high quality, and the game can be enjoyed by children as well as adults.another reason i like this game is that two players can play this game alone, and sometimes it is hard to find games like that. you typically have two owners of a game and a third person (a friend?) who comes over and plays less often and is always at a disadvantage.also, the game doesn't last too long. you are not going to get bogged down for hours, and you can ""get a game in"" before you go to bed, or before you go out.if you enjoy this game, there are some expansion sets to this game that you can also purchase.  they each add additional pieces and additional rules, and they change the strategy and make it more interesting (just when you might have been getting tired with the game!)they are the following:carcassonne inns & cathedralscarcassonne traders & builderscarcassonne the princess and the dragoncarcassonne the towercarcassonne the river (sort of a mini-expansion)if, however, you think you would like to purchase them all at once, instead of one by one down the road, you can elect to purchase the ""carcassonne: big box"" instead.  this contains the full original game as well all of the expansions listed above.  it is bundled together at a big discount, and as well as with a big space savings -no extra boxes lying around.in addition, if you enjoy carcassonne, you can also purchase separate standalone games related to carcassonne, but which are not expansions, and which cannot be played as part of the original game (or any of the expansions listed above).they are the following:carcassonne hunters & gathererscarcassonne the castlecarcassonne the citycarcassonne the ark of the covenantfinally, for those who enjoyed this game, i must also recommend other strategy games from the manufacturer, rio grande games.  i have also purchased the strategy card games ""lost cities"" and ""san juan"" from this manufacturer, and have enjoyed them immensely as well!",Positive,Negative,0.64468235
"this is a great game to introduce you to the world of gaming beyond board games likehasbro the game of lifeand similar offerings.  if you are no longer satisfied with that genre or level of game, then i highly recommend carcassone.carcassone is a tile-laying game.  in this game players take turns drawing tiles at random and adding them to a growing medieval region called carcassone.  after you add a tile to the game you can play one of your seven ""followers"" so that it becomes a robber, a farmer, a knight, a monk, etc.  you accumulate points as you complete towns you own, roads you control, monastaries you inhabit, and farms you have a farmer on.the only element of chance in this game is in the tiles you draw.  once you have a tile in hand strategy comes into play.  plus, with only 7 followers, you have to decide where and when to play them.you and up to 4 friends or family members can play at a time.  the game rules suggest that this game is for players ages 10 and up, but one of our children is 9 and she was able to pick up the rules and do just fine (with only a small bit of help here and there at first).all in all this is a solid game, the pices are durable, and should hold up for many, many playings.  the game plays fairly quickly, sometimes taking less than 30 mins to play.if you are just being introduced to gaming beyond milton bradley's traditional offerings you will probably consider this to be a 5-star game.  if, however, you are an experienced gamer that enjoys games at least as complex as thethe settlers of catanseries, this game will seem kind of simple - enjoyable, but simple.  for that reason i'm assigning only 4 stars overall for this game.oh, it also plays well as a 2-player game!",Positive,Positive,0.00513655

"lost cities is a quick playing card game for two that involves constant choices of calculated risk.each player will have a hand of eight cards, and on their turn will play or discard one of them and then draw to replace it .  there are five possible ""expeditions"" (card piles, separately by player) that can be played to, corresponding to the five colors of cards in the deck.  for each of the five colors there are three investment cards and one card for each number 2-10.there are three key rules that shape strategies:1) once you start an expedition, it will be scored.  score is the total value of the cards played there minus 20 (investment cards multiply score).  this makes starting a pile risky and discourages haphazard playing.2) additional cards in an expedition must be higher in value than previously played cards (investment cards are the lowest ""value"").  this adds depth to choices about what to play vs keep in your hand, as well as making awareness of your opponent's cards important since there is only one copy of each numeric card.3) cards can be drawn from the top of the deck or from the top of one of the face up discard piles (one for each color).  being aware of a card's usefulness to your opponent is just as important as it's usefulness to you when deciding to discard.everything fits together well to form an easy to teach game that's a lot of fun and won't take forever to play.  well, one game won't at least, but i have played for hours at a time before...the theme is purely decorative.  this is a numeric based card game and anyone looking for something that captures a bit of the feeling of exploration will not find it here.  that said the art is well done and gives the game a nice style.lost cities is beautifully designed and executed and is easily my favorite two player only game.highly recommended.note: if you like lost cities you may want to check out the board game version.  it plays 2-5 and incorporates some of the core mechanics found here.  this is the better game, but both are well done and a lot of fun.",Positive,Positive,0.0059892773
"for those who don't spend their time concerning themselves with international board game affairs, rio grande games is a company who basically searches out some of the very best strategic board games around the globe, brings them to the united states, translates them into english then unleashes their addictive tendencies to a whole new unsuspecting civilization.keeping that in mind, lost cities is exactly one such game, written by the legendary reiner knizia.  made originally in germany by a company called kosmos back in 1999, rio grande brought the game to north america shortly thereafter and has released subsequent identical new editions every few years since due to unwavering demand.  the object of the game, in its very simplest terms, is to end up with the most points after as many rounds as you seem fit (a round takes between 20 and 40 minutes, although, i can attest that after several hundred of them, expect that time to decrease to around 12 minutes).lost cities is perhaps the most addicting strategy game i've ever played and that's saying a lot considering i frequent rio grande's immense catalog very often!  all the game consists of is a fairly small foldout board and 60 cards.  the player is responsible for the pen, paper, and possibly calculator required to do battle.  like all rio grande games, the quality of the materials and detailed artwork are second to none, however, don't expect to be spending much of your time studying the pictures because once you grasp the game's mechanics, it's quick and intense with good-decision making becoming the key to victory.the game is structured to offer players 5 worldly locations (egypt, atlantis, a volcanic island, and the himalayas) with which to attempt an expedition (which in this case means a sequential run of cards beginning with the lowest possible (2) and ending with the highest possible (10)).  additionally the player has the option of playing investor cards, which act as multipliers for the total points at the end of the round.  the trouble is, fail to clear the investment of the expedition and these cards multiply your losses as well.  it sounds rather simplistic in my summary but the game simply does everything right!  it's easy to learn, fun to play, and extremely addicting.  the winner of each round isn't often known until after all of the points are tallied, which undoubtedly adds to the tension of earlier decision making.perhaps the game's greatest strength is the simple fact that like classics such as checkers and tic-tac-toe, it accomplishes an incredible amount of game play with minimal physical setup.  there are no timers, dice, stats, or massive-choice options to consider.  rather the game is as simple as tossing and drawing cards while watching what your opponent is doing on the other side of the board.  it has the charm of card games like uno but with far more strategic and replay value.it is designed only for 2 players and the recommended age requirement is 10 & up.  i strongly recommend this game as a fantastic way to pass the hours of cold winter nights.",Positive,Positive,0.06051571

"very fun 2 player game! quite simple and very intelligently designed (to be quick, relatively uncomplicated and fun with loads of re-playability!). i play with my husband as well as our 9 yr old son. we all love it. takes about 10-45 minutes (depending on how many rounds you decide to play. it can be quick or you can just keep going and tally each round (best out of 3, best out of 5, etc).the rules are nowhere near as difficult as they first appear. the part that seems confusing at first is the scoring. essentially, you take each row of cards, add them up, minus 20 (which can leave you in the negative) and then times by however many necessary (depending on the cards you laid). read the rules and you'll get what i mean. anyways, point is, it becomes really easy once you play once or twice.love it! play it all the time because it's quick and fun. def recommend!!!!",Positive,Positive,0.09338872
"very happy with this game, nd i am rarely totally happy with a product. game is easy to pick up, and your strategies will develop over time. the card quality could be better. these cards will show use over time. likewise, the paintings on the cards are a bit out--of-date and could be better. but i rarely look at the cards anyways and focus n the gameplay.",Positive,Positive,0.15927815

"lost cities card game: 2 players, ages 13+, average play time = 15-20 minutes per roundfirst, i'd like to praise the quality of the components.  they are beautiful to look at and very sturdy.  the cards are huge and i had no trouble reading them, even across the table when glancing at my opponent's expeditions.  the manual does a good job in explaining all of the rules, and the game doesn't take long at all to learn, especially if you've already played the board game.the game is a mix of strategy and luck.  it's very possible that you'll be drawing some really crappy cards from the draw pile, though the five discard piles help to alleviate this.  the investment cards really add depth to the gameplay, forcing players to really think about how they want to tailor their hand and play their cards.  not only will the player be trying to score as many points as possible on the expeditions they've placed investment cards on, they'll be trying to prevent their opponent from receiving the cards they need on the investment cards they've played.  sometimes a player will keep a useless card in their hand just so that the other player doesn't snatch it up in the discard pile.  observing the other player's expeditions becomes just as important as building on your own.i've been asked a few times ever since i've written my lost cities review on which game is better...that is...the card game or the board game.  having finally owned the former, i still find myself at odds in chosing one over the other.  the card game is a simpler, dumbed down version of the board game, however this does not necessarily make it inferior.  some (note the word ""some"") casual gamers might find the board game to be ""too much"" and the card game ""just right.""  jennifer enjoys playing the board game and she rarely takes a liking to anything in my collection.  even though i consider her a casual gamer, each person has different tastes and different preferences.if you're looking for a casual two player game that can be played quickly, without too many rules to think about, then the card game is a solid choice.  if you have more time and more people involved and don't mind the addition of a few more rules and components, then the board game would have a lot to offer.  i personally utilize the card game when i want some one on one time with one of the kids or with jennifer, and bring out the board game on family game night.  either way, both games are fun to play in their own right.",Positive,Positive,0.03662148

"this game is deceptively simple.  it's easy to learn, but hard to score (have paper and pen!  or a scientific calculator!  which most iphones and androids have by turning screen sideways when in standard calculator).basically two players each draw cards keeping 8 in hand.  on their turn they play expedition cards (or handshakes) on their side of the board or discard a card into a discard stack matching the color of the discard.  then they draw a new card.  each card has a color which corresponds to a particular expedition.  players score points by advancing their expeditions.  handshakes multiply the points total.  when the draw stack is exhausted, play ends and players tally their score.but wait!  each expedition costs 20 points to start, so you want to be able to just start every expedition.  and you can only play handshakes before playing the numbered expedition cards.  and you always have to play a higher expedition number than the one previous!  so lots of room for strategy and for massive point loss!  if you play handshakes but don't start an expedition in time (with a numbered card) then the 20 point cost is multiplied!so the game requires a bit of math and planning skill.  it's not for younger folks who might not grasp the pre-algebraic formula (the multiplying of the handshakes with the numbered expeditions), but with parental assistance, i don't think it's too complicated for 10 and up.  it's really best as a 'relationship' game.  meaning partners or room mates can play easily.  each round is about 15 minutes but can last up to 30 minutes depending on the skill and experience of the players and their focus.  because you don't need 100% focus to play this game.  it's easy to play at a coffee shop or even while watching a rerun on tv (or a sports match).bottom line, it's made for two players, easy to learn, and lots of fun.  the only true two-player-only euro game i put ahead of this is rivals for catan.  but unlike rivals for catan (their two player version of catan) this game is easier to learn and quicker to play.",Positive,Positive,0.00706208
"the game has a lot of potential and is a blast to play for about 30-40 play throughs, then it becomes the exact same game each and every time and it all comes to luck as to who wins. i loved the game when first learning, but after playing so much with my wife we found that there is only one strategy and the rest falls to luck, so each game looked the same and felt the same to us. we don't pick this game up at all anymore.  we actually keep it packed up and sitting in a box due the predictability of the game play. but it is a great game for kids. ours are currently too young, but they will enjoy this game quite a bit one day.",Positive,Positive,0.27703255

"this game is a great way to pass twenty to thirty minutes.  it is very easy to learn and does not have any pieces to lose, or money to count.  the strategies, however, are numerous, and there is an equal amount of luck as skill involved in good gameplay.i really liked how the game could only be played with two people, as i was tired of games that could be played with two, but which were really meant to be enjoyed by three or more...game contents: 1 deck of game cards, and one small board.  note: if you want to make this game really portable you don't even need to bring the board.  it is just a place to put discarded cards and a way to help organize your cards.  as long as you have a pencil and paper for scoring at the end of the game, you can play it everywhere that you have a table.  (i figure you need as much space to lay down your cards as the size of a typical monopoly board).playing note: one thing that was initially a little confusing to us when we were reading the instructions, was that the instructions do not explain that you are to place your cards on the opposite side of the board as your opponent.  you can each play all 5 expeditions, in a head to head manner.  we were sitting on a couch at a coffee table, and we had turned the board horizontally to face us (instead of vertically) and the instructions were confusing until we moved the board 90 degrees.  the game designers assumed that you would play the game as one would play a game of checkers, sitting across from one another, but you don't actually have to play this way, even though you do need to turn your board for the same effect.this game is really fun and i would highly recommend other games from the same manufacturer (rio grande games).  they really have a knack for publishing great strategy games.  they even release expansion sets to their popular games, and they credit the players who gave them the ideas for the expansion cards.  pretty neat!",Positive,Negative,0.52980983

"this is a great two-player game.  it has the right mix of skill and luck to keep an even playing field.  and it's fun.the description spends a little too much time trying to convince you there's a story, but it's just a good card game.  each color represents an expedition.  for each expedition you begin (play cards for), you subtract the cost so you need to collect enough of that color to make a profit.  the really tricky part is that you have to play the cards in numerical order.  if you play the red 8 and then pick up the red 6, you won't be able to play the 6.  since you have a limited number of turns, you are sort of playing chicken to hold on to the high cards long enough to get the low ones played first, but not so long that you run out of time to play the higher ones, too.",Positive,Positive,0.2400525

"lost cities is a simple card game for two people. there is a deck of cards and a play mat (yes, that's all!). the goal is to gain the most points by playing expedition cards in the 5 expedition areas: the sands of egypt, the watery depths of atlantis, the icy wastes of tibet, the jungles of the amazon, and the volcanic mountains of ... mars? mexico? sicily? i'm not sure about the last one. players take turns drawingfrom the deck and playing an expedition card. you keep 8 cards in your hand throughout the entire game. on your turn, you either play an expedition card (numbered 2-10), a funding card, or a card to a discard pile, and draw a card from either the deck or the top discard.each player plays on his/her own side of the playmat, so you do not interfere with each other's expeditions. you cannot play a lower expedition card than the top one in your pile (you've already passed it by), so there's some tension in whether to hold, discard, or play. funding cards must be played before any expedition cards, and they have a multiplicative effect on the points from that expedition; x2, x3, or x4, depending on how many funding cards you played (i keep thinking it is an exponential progression and not a geometric one, but a smarter man than me designed it).the game is over when the last card is drawn. points are awarded in the following way: you get -20 for starting an expedition, then you sum the value of each expedition card (2-10) and apply the funding multiplier to the sum, then sum over all expeditions. i recommend using pen and paper. the funding cards make quite a difference; avoiding them yields a score in the single digits, while using them yields a score around 100. the risk multiplies with each funding card, though, since you multiply negative scores as well.in my experience, you always draw out the deck faster than you think. there are 60 cards total, so with 2 players, you need to be wrapping up after your 15th draw or so. you can expect to nearly complete 1 expedition and dabble in two others, so high cards in your off suit is helpful. drawing from the discard pile keeps the clock ticking longer, even if you don't want the cards. it's almost always worth starting an expedition if you have a 9&10, but 4,5,6 may not be good enough.the best part of the game is the beautiful artwork on the cards, which goes the full length. the colors are vibrant and depict a running scene of the terrain being explored, with some kind of ruins on card 10. it plays quicklly, no more than 15 minutes per game, and the strategy is fairly simple. that makes it an ideal game for just before bed.",Positive,Positive,0.026513282

"playing structured games is a good way for a child to learn many skills, including counting, matching and the beginnings of strategic thought.  this game is excellent because it can immediately be played even by a two-year-old, although not with perfect strategy.  the game, in other words, allows for some growth of the player without growing old.  some of the things a young player will gradually learn to incorporate:- placing a token for an animal card on the best of two squares available(early on, a new player will naturally just pick the first one found)- using the free squares in advance- saving ""power"" cards (dragon and unicorn) for when needed / most useful- blocking opponents' best movesjust learning to play a turn-based game is a big milestone for a little one.  this game is as good as it gets for sustaining the child's interest, reinforcing many intellectual skills, and growing with the child.  you can't go wrong for the price.  see my other reviews and you will realize that i don't give praise lightly! :)",Positive,Positive,0.008846151
"my husband and i love the regularsequence gameso when i saw this sequence for kids i had to get it for mine (6 and 3yrs old).  my kids are very into board games but there's only so much candyland and chutes and ladders a person can take.in this version of sequence, you each get three cards to start and your colored chips to lay down.  (it's nice for my 6 year old, because although he gets the game enough to play the adult version, he can't yet hold all of the cards in his hands for that one, so 3 cards are definatley better then 7 and the cards are almost half the size as regular cards.)  instead of having the normal playing cards of ace's - king's, these are all animals that differ enough that they don't get confused what card goes with what animal.  in this version instead of needed to get two rows of four in order to win, you only have to get one row of four.i'm glad that my 3 year old likes this game, of course we always have to remind her to draw a card after she plays a card, and she can't hold the cards in her hand yet (or at least doesn't care to) and she her strategy of the game is to put down the animals that she likes the best, she still is involved in the game and not left out at family game time.  it's nice to be able to include her in a game, without her gameplay messing us up, even though she doesn't understand how to strategize to win at 3 years old, she is just another person to make our gameplay harder.  as for my 6 year old, it is one of his favorite games.",Positive,Positive,0.029209342

"i bought this game for my 4-year-old grandson. it is not challenging enough for him, although we happily played it and had a fun time. however, he was much more taken with junior monopoly (which requires an adult to do the reading until he memorizes the cards). the sequence game is really just another version of a bingo/tic tac toe-type game and he has at least one other game like that. for kids that are into games, though, i would say this is a decent choice. the learning is simply in figuring out a winning strategy; there is no content learning as the animals on the playing cards are ones that probably most 3-year-olds already know. one advantage of this game is that it is short, so if you have a small window of time to play a game, it's a good choice (versus monopoly, which is great for a long rainy afternoon).",Positive,Positive,0.042489253

"with three young girls at home, one being a huge monster high fan, the kids were quite excited and had high hopes for this playset.  after getting a lecture from my 8 year old on the difference between monster high and ever after high and the origins of briar beauty, i realized i was in over my head and just moved onto the assembly portion on the set.assembly for me took just under 20 minutes.  i had no specific issues except i did not realize the ""spine"" of the book was actually a storage area where the bed was stored.  also, the railing at the very top of the set was missing in my set, or it is hidden well enough that i never found it.  while i did not spend any time playing with the set, my impression of the set was not very favorable.  to me, the set seemed flimsy and not very sturdy.  i then turned it over to my three children to test.8 year old:  my eight year old really liked the doll and accessories.  however, they specifically said that they thought the house ""was a mess"".  they also commented that it was hard to get the mask on the doll.  they gave the set 3 stars, attributing most of the rating toward the doll, which they loved.10 year old:  their exact words are ""i wouldn't give this as a present to anyone.""  they hated the fact the dj stand in the house was made out of paper and they felt the set would not withstand any significant usage.  they also mentioned they thought the hands pop off the doll real easy.  they gave the set 1 star.6 year old:  similar to my 10 year old, my 6 year old did not like the fact the dj stand was made out of paper.  they commented that it was really hard to get the doll in the dj stand and have the dj stand keep the right shape.  they only gave the set 1 star as well.personally, i do think the set feels cheap and i am disappointed that it came missing a piece.  i will give the set some kudos for the overall design, how the bed is stored, and how compact the set can become for storage.  however, i was just not impressed with the execution of the idea.  if i had paid the current price of $49.99, i would have felt a little ripped off.  i would give the set 3 stars, but i am deducting a star for the missing piece, giving the set a rating of 2 stars.after having the set for several weeks, it pretty much sits on the side unplayed with.  my children also got thebarbie sisters life in the dreamhouse camperaround the same time and that playset is still being used on a daily basis while this one collects dust.averaging all our ratings together, as a family, we gave the set a mean rating of 1.75 stars which i will round up to 2 stars.",Negative,Negative,0.98165363

"i applaud mattel's marketing department for trying to make this embarrassingly simple game seem ~t0t@lly @w3s0m3~ but ultimately it is exactly what you think it is: ping pong balls and a connect four board.the concept is as follows: you draw a card with a pattern on it. you try to create the pattern by bouncing balls into the grid. the first one to land the pattern wins. yay!as is the case when you intentionally bounce ping pong balls, they have a tendency to go everywhere. unlike actual connect four, you will be spending 90% of the time chasing after the rouge balls. expert ball bouncers may find the game slightly more rewarding if they are consistently able to keep the balls on the board.i will offer some praise to the grid itself, which does have a fairly high success rate at landing the ball into a slot. as long as you don't hit one of the separator pegs (which is very likely) the ping pong ball will land easily into place. it's also a game that is easy to learn and teaches some skills that may translate to a higher angry birds score.according to the box, this game allows up to 4 players. i'm assuming if you have 4 players it has to be teams of two, however, because otherwise the game would be impossible (there are only two colors of balls and some patterns require 5-balls to complete).overall: this game is exactly as fun as you would expect, or probably less than you would expect. the game of throwing balls into grids is not original. i've seen the game at fairs and amusement parks plenty of times. the difference, however, is the size of the board. if the board were twice as large or even larger, it would be significantly more exciting and would reduce the likelihood of the ball going wild across the room. ultimately bounce off is one of those games that will be played with for approximately 30 minutes and then hidden away in the dark corners of a closet for many years until finally being donated to the local good will.",Negative,Positive,0.4123669

"i guess i didn't really know what this product would be when i selected it, but i was sure disappointed when we opened it.  there are four tubes of ""deco pop"" (basically, play-doh in a tube) that are perhaps slightly larger than lipstick tubes.  when you remove the caps, each tube has a small opening.  there is a ""styler"" that looks vaguely like a hot glue gun.  you put the deco pop tube in the styler, push the trigger, which pushes the base of the deco pop tube, which in turn extrudes the colored dough.the dough is meant to be extruded onto the picture frame pieces included in the set (there are about five separate pieces).  there are color coded dotted lines, curly-cues, flowers and other designs that your child is supposed to follow, so there is zero creativity involved.  extruding the dough over all the lines will take your child about 15 minutes.  then they can assemble it into a picture frame.  the dough is supposed to harden on the cardboard picture frame for permanent use.  done.  fun is over (unless, of course, you want to spring for more deco pop tubes, but for the price of this 15 minutes of fun, it's not something i'd recommend).the only good thing for me is that i didn't spend my own money on this.  i recommend that you not spend yours either.",Negative,Negative,0.9764065

"spending much of my youth in oregon, my grandparents felt that it was important that i be active in school , sports and various other community events when opportunity arose. my grandfather was an eagle scout thanks to a real bald eagle foot a native american friend of the family gave to him for his birthday. truth be told, he wasn't really a ""native american"" per say, but was really a die hard washington d.c. redskins fan. he was one of the fairest redheads i'd ever seen. he had access to all sorts of wildlife at the archery shop he ran.with no scouting programs available in the area, grandfather insisted that i be involved in similar activities to help my development. as a substitution, a popular camping program to teach life skills was run in our area by nambla.a community outreach program of grown men, many of whom just got out of prison, actively engaged in the nurturing relationship of young boys.  it was the perfect program for boys in search of good mentorship when they had no father figures. in my case, my grandfather due to his frail condition, camping would have been far too much of a hardship on him. besides, he didn't want to miss back to back episodes of `barney miller'. something he could not do with zero reception up in the mountains.  it was 'his' show that  he would watch regardless of where he was.  one time, grandma's bowels were acting up and she needed to be rushed to the hospital. on the way to the hospital it hit seven o'clock. after frantically driving around downtown in the rain, he pulled the car over and watched the show from the other side of the window of a closed television repair shop.grandma didn't make it that night, but i tend to believe it that it was simply her time to go.on one of the nambla campouts, i became lost in the midnight game of pajama hide and seek. the purpose was to pair the ""fathers"" up with the boys for the weekend.  it was one of the more popular games since it involved pajamas, but this particular night simply did not go well. in fact, because the boys outnumbered the ""fathers"" no one came looking for me that night. as a result, i spent the night lost in the woods and fell asleep by a fallen tree.sometimes, i would hear footsteps or hear rapid heavy breathing, but i did could not see anything. i thought that it was a predator watching over me since they would not harm kids.when i woke up in the morning, it turned out i was only about thirty feet from the camp site, but i simply did consider going in that direction.  i thought the bright lights were for the dog kennel that was along the fence that surrounded our campsite. those dogs scared me and i did not want to be near them.what did happen was that the good men of nambla did in fact go looking for me that night, but several of them became lost themselves and ended up sleeping in the woods or their vans. to think of the sacrifices they made on my behalf really brought me comfort that morning.i ended up going home that day ""father(less)"" but never forgetting the valuable lesson i learned from being lost.  sometimes, it is best to not give up so easily when it gets dark.this figure serves as a reminder of that frightful night spent alone in the woods while a mysterious predator watched over me.",Negative,Negative,0.6286585
"to be honest, i was on the fence about this predator figure. taking into account, it is simply another repaint and branded as something near doctrinally correct based off of the mega online blockbuster film ""batman:dead end"" by paul w.s. anderson. i just was not sure i needed a yellow predator figure in my collection.amazon prime often lives above and beyond their great name when i get packages in one day instead of two (i can't wait for the amazon drones to deliver within ...wait for it...hours!!!) as was the case here, my figure arrived the following day upon ordering it. it was there while i was sitting on the couch on my front yporch drinking sugar-free lemonade when the fedex man dejuan arrived. he is good at his job, but on a personal level i'm not really keen on him since he's run over several of my coon dogs with his truck. since i run little hunting ""tours"" for boring office guys who live in the north, those dogs are part of my livelihood. it is hard to tell if he is in a hurry, or just tired of stopping at my place one to two times a day. my dogs seems to like him though, often times, they will hug his bare leg or chase his truck as he drives off.then, it hit me.the reason why i was on the fence about it is because of the name ""wasp"" the predator figure has.when i was growing up, my parents were very strict religious people. my mom was dutifully supportive of my dad's freelance revival tours he did. preaching the good word from the same book. all in all, he made really good money at it. even his motivational cassette tape series turned quite a profit.as ""great"" as he was on stage, tape or to other people, he was extremely hard on us kids. he was very firm, but also very fair. his punishments were always proportionately based on the the offense and we could choose which punishment we would receive. no one ever thought to question his punishments since it was a higher will that utilized him as an instrument for righteousness.one sunday during an after church family picnic where we would gather around on the ground and dad would eat all the food we prepared for him and read for hours from the good book to us. i started get restless and began pestering one of my sisters. dad would have none of that once he saw i had interrupted his sermon. he slammed the book shut, got up, marched straight over to me, grabbed my arm and was about to give me a spanking in right front of my family.then, one of sisters spoke up and told him it was still sunday.bless her heart.he never gave out spankings on sunday. instead, he grabbed me by the ear and marched me over to a nearby log. there he made me abruptly sit down to think about my sinful ways until he told me i could get up.no exceptions.what i did not see (i'm not sure if he did or not) was a yellow jacket was on the spot where i was forcefully sat down. i really wanted to say something, but ""no exceptions"" meant just that.no exceptions.i do not recall how long i was on the log for, could of been hours since the good book is a pretty big book, but i do remember coming to in the emergency room surrounded by most of my family. it turned out, i had a bad reaction to the yellow jacket sting on my bottom.a memory i tried to forget, but once seeing this figure in hand brought it all back.one star.",Negative,Positive,0.31954345

"these alleged &#8220;learning activities&#8221; are framed within three alleged &#8220;mysteries&#8221; in which the player has to complete the activities in order to earn &#8220;clues&#8221;.  the first mystery involves missing shoes, the second involves missing rhinestone items and i haven&#8217;t worked up the gumption to plow through the third mystery.  each mystery has ten sections, and at the completion of all sections the &#8220;clues&#8221; are jigsaw pieces which assemble to show the culprit.  before, after and in between each section you are subjected to inane babble between barbie and one of her perfect-looking friends.the &#8220;learning activities&#8221; are, at best, only tangentially related to the &#8220;mystery&#8221;.  in one activity you have to find the &#8220;hidden&#8221; items.  except that the items are sitting in plain view.  there are several &#8220;hidden items&#8221;, but you are only instructed to find three.  afterwards, you have to sort the names of the items, along with similar words, into columns.  for instance, if the hidden items were a star, a cup and a crown, you might have to sort those three words, along with pup, gown, car, down, bar and sup into matching columns.another activity comes when barbie goes to interview someone.  the activity involves picking out what the character is &#8220;thinking&#8221;.  there are three objects floating in mid-air and you may be instructed to pick one that starts with the &#8220;h&#8221; sound, for instance.  i often found it difficult to adequately hear the letter sound as pronounced by the game, but it&#8217;s still not terribly hard as two of the three objects start with the correct letter sound.other activities involve inserting the proper letters to complete the given words and other sorts of spelling activities (one such activity involves printing t-shirts &#8211; go figure).  the game comes loaded with many words already, and you can also upload your child&#8217;s spelling words.  as with all of the activities, the difficulty of the words increases or decreases based on your child&#8217;s performance.in addition to the mysteries, there is also a &#8220;map&#8221; which will allow you to travel around and do other activities, but they are all very similar to the ones listed above.my kids and i all found these activities very repetitive and boring after a few rounds.  it was a chore to complete enough activities to get the &#8220;clues&#8221; to solve the mysteries.  and the solution is not exactly earth-shaking when it comes.  if you&#8217;ve paid even passing attention to barbie and her friends&#8217; inane chatter, you&#8217;ve long since figured it out.furthermore, these activities really aren&#8217;t &#8220;educational&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s just a ploy for companies to get dedicated parents to spend lots of hard-earned money to &#8220;enrich&#8221; their children&#8217;s education.  the young and developing brain is not hard-wired to acquire literacy through these drill-and-repeat sorts of exercises, especially through electronic media.  if you really want to develop your child&#8217;s literacy, blocks, legos, play-doh, boardgames and other sorts of toys are far better for developing pre-literacy skills.  and, of course, the best way for children to actually learn to read is to read actual books with a parent or other fluent reader.  if you want your child to be a good reader, let them learn to love reading so they&#8217;ll do a lot of it.",Negative,Negative,0.6012299

"for starters i would like to mention this is not my fist experience with k'nex products. in the past i have ordered a couple mario kart sets for my kid, as well as some kiss and the beatles yellow submarine figurine sets. my experience with the brand had been great so as a fan of family guy, i did not hesitate to order this. i would love to tell you the experience was great but i am afraid i can't, this set was so frustrating that my kid simply did not care about finishing it, nor did i.the first problem i encountered was the instructions, we have plenty of lego sets (which my kid loves) and we have never struggled with the instructions like we did with this one. the manual tries to differentiate the pieces you need to add from the ones you already added by using red and gray colors; the problem is, there are gray pieces, so there was a point in which we skipped two pieces because of this. as you can see, the top of the car is a red cardboard, as odd as that was for me, i expected some kind of hard material that could make this more durable and was disappointed when i found the cover to be a very flimsy piece of cardboard.if this was not enough, the design has very notorious structural flaws, when we were putting it together i kept wondering how this would stand together once completed, the answer? it simply doesn't. when the time came to add the cover to the top of the car, it broke into pieces. at that point, my kid had lost any interest and left me there with a broken set. stubborn as i am, i kept trying to figure out a way to put it together, i was finally able to, only for it to break again.so, save your money and get a lego set instead; true, they do not have the family guy license, but even as a collector this set is not worth it. for some reason, k'nex included a peter griffin figure wearing a gray suit instead of his characteristic green pants and white shirt&#8230; wait, k'nex does have that figure, in a sold-separately set&#8230; i see what they did there...",Negative,Negative,0.98453736
"i'm a fan of k'nex and appreciate the original designs they've come up with using their beam and joint pieces, especially their large roller coasters. this model attempts something more lego-like and the result is perpetual frustration for kids (and any adults swept into the effort). the directions for the build don't have the clarity of lego directions, and the design itself has a large number of weak joints that result in frequent structural collapse. adding to the problem is the fact that the bricks don't have the same gripping power as lego bricks. i also don't like the use of cardboard for the roof of the car. i find it humorous that the peter figure comes fully assembled when there are directions for assembling him, and placing him in the car requires that he be taken apart anyway. i don't quite understand the intended audience for the toy. i'm not a prude and i introduce above-age material to my kids all the time, but i can't imagine a toy company seriously thinking that family guy is appropriately paired with 8 year olds. our set was missing one piece, but we had it in our supply of k'nex so that was a non-issue. in the end, i would only recommend this toy to a die-hard fan of family guy, someone who is happy displaying the car and not playing with it.",Negative,Negative,0.9943112

(everything is light/gray except the pieces you are putting together.)  this did become a challenge though when you had a gray piece to add, we had actually missed it in the instructions and had to go back, which is common anyway in building detailed pieces.  the low score rating is actually for the knex pieces themselves.  when we got half way through the project it became very unstable.  the pieces didn't fit tightly and the project often fell a part.  we actually put it away at one point because we were both getting frustrated that the piece kept coming a part (which was often done by me, the adult and not the 5 year old).  i probably will stick to lego's brand unless a kit comes up with knex that looks exciting.",Negative,Negative,0.99134105
"i've played with k'nex construction sets in the past with the kidlets - most recently put together a suspension bridge and they are fun.  however, in this particular incarnation, k'nex is trying to be like legos, and they failed miserably.apparently the k'nex people didn't realize that the same people who buy legos would be attracted to this product due to its similarities and didn't pay attention to how clearly the lego instructions are laid out.  with the k'nex instructions (all graphics, no words) it wasn't clear if you were supposed to use two of one item or if the arrow between the items meant that you were moving the piece in that direction.  it wasn't clear if you were using two really tiny pieces or one tiny piece in certain sections.  i am the family instruction reader so i know good instructions from bad, and these could have been much clearer graphically.one of the main problems, though, was that the blocks didn't lock together very tightly in instances when they had to overlap rather than be exactly on top of one another, and the design didn't allow for reinforcement of those weak spots, as the lego constructs are designed to do.  we never actually got the car fully put together because it would break in half before we could put the top section on; after five attempts we just gave up on it.i would reiterate the manufacturer's warning about a choking hazard.  there are a lot of very small pieces in this kit that would be dangerous to small children.  and some of those pieces were very tiny and easy to drop.  it didn't seem as though the package contained any extra pieces to possibly compensate for those that might drop and disappear in carpets.i have to agree with the other reviewers that it was amusing that the there were instructions for assembling the peter character, when he came fully assembled, and that in order to place him within the car you have to remove the lower half of his body.  i don't watch the tv show ""family guy"" so i can't comment on whether a toy based on that program is age-appropriate; to me it was just a k'nex toy that i thought the kidlets might like.so, in summary, don't waste your money.  while the plastic pieces appear to be well-made, the same care wasn't taken in the creation of the instructions or the interlocking design for the car.  if you can't actually make it stay together, it's rather useless and becomes just an exercise in frustration.  as the kidlets told me to tell you folks, ""this one gets a bad review"".",Negative,Negative,0.9937245

"oftentimes, it is hard to believe that the world's greatest detective has been around for seventy-five years. with his first introduction in the year nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, the united states of america was celebrating the 1st world science fiction convention in new york while a mere few states west of that on the very same day, theodore roosevelt's head was being dedicated at mount rushmore. just earlier that year, a little unknown company by the name of hewlett-packard had started up who would later take the world by storm with their wildly successful touchpad. nylon stockings for curious men went on sale for the first time in wilmington, delaware and the first little league baseball game was played at williamsport, pennsylvania.these were very exciting times.my father, being one male too many in a polygamist community, was exiled as a teenager and forced to live life on the rails finding work from town to town. often times, during the winter months, distinguished gentlemen would hire him to clean their pools, mow their lawns or wash their cars as they smoked their long cigarettes and watched him. he never went into detail beyond that during his solo on-stage musical memoirs.on one such occasion, i recall him describing his time fishing  experience with no rod or net, during a very hot summer in washington state on a wharf during lo-tide. having spent all his earnings on a comic book series called ""detective comics"" with a then unknown character called the ""batman"", immediately, he knew there was something very right about what he was seeing. waiting for the tide to return so he could try and catch a fish with his tender bare hands, he would read and reread  the comic book. ahead of his time, he thought the ""dark"" and ""mysterious"" character needed a younger, brightly-colored, emotionally vulnerable assistant, or distraction from his demanding tasks.father, the happy camper, was all too eager to be that distraction.sadly, he knew it was just a fantasy, but he tried to fulfill that role in his daily life in one way or another as employment opportunity became available.fast forward to today, we are treated by the collectibles designer series with a new batman figure based from the work of famous republican greg capullo. at such a surprisingly low price point, the figure offers a great deal of packaging. enough excess to draw the attention of a fellow enviomentalist. seriously, i have not been this excited since the great actor and dreamboat ben affleck was announced as the next batman.with that said, because this figure does not resemble ben affleck who is now batman, i refuse to rate it any higher than one star.",Negative,Positive,0.40185034

"we are big fan of ttr, and if you look you'll see i rarely write negative reviews.  and, as you can tell from the other reviews a lot of people still really like this one in spite of what i'm about to say (and by no means do i mean no disrespect to my fellow reviewers who liked the game).  i will note that we always play with two player and we used the dummy player as suggested with this version (so, it is quite possible that it is better with more players).  but, there were enough things that i did not like about it that i though they were worth mentioning, especially since i'm sure others will play it as a two-player game as well.1. the bonus for having most coins left at the end of the game seems way out of whack. a single coin could be worth 35 points in a two player game, which was enough to sway most game (and in one case turned what would have been a fun win into a less fun slaughter).2. only about once per game is it necessary for either of us to pay the other person for the second route claimed. i did chose to go around one time as well so i wouldn't have to pay. together, this rule changed game play very little which didn't seem like a great mechanic to me.3. if you take a loan you can't get the 35 point bonus card.  so, since you cannot pass you will often be forced to either do something you don't want to do or try to stall longer than the other player until they are forced to do something they don't want to do.4. this is a minor point, but the font on the board is hard to read, especially since it is used to spell cities from a part of the world that will not familiar to some people.i guess my main point is you should at least think twice before getting this one if you'll mostly be playing a two-player game.  i highly recommend the india and switzerland expansion for two players.  it costs a bit more, but you get two maps, two sets of destination tickets, and some fun new mechanics that work very well.

"all my life, i've been a dinosaur freak! i have purchased any manner of dinosaur related product, both for myself and as gifts. when i was offered this set of twelve jumbo dinosaurs, the kid in me simply had to have them (i won't bore you with details about my toy collection)! despite my passion for the subject, however, i am also a firm believer in the concept of truth in advertising. and while this is a perfectly acceptable set of creatures, it does not live up to the billing.cons:1) these were labeled as jumbo and, in no way, could you construe this set as oversized. at best, the average creature falls into a 3"" by 4"" range. they are not tiny, but certainly not jumbo.2) the set of twelve includes four duplicates. this wouldn't bother me if they were the same dinosaur in a different pose, but they are exact replicas. in essence, therefore, you've got eight different dinosaurs as opposed to the listed twelve. they claim at least 11 dinosaurs may be included in the assortment (or as few as 6). if 11 different models are made, why not have each represented in a package?3) the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. the toys are just placed into an unremarkable plastic bag without even a proper label. if you are looking for gift quality toys, this would fall short of my expectations.truthfully, though, none of these things is a real deal-breaker for me. i just don't like advertising that doesn't truly represent the product and i believe the listing should be amended. i did like the eight different dinosaurs provided. they were made from a good and detailed mold and are solidly constructed. despite each having the same goofy grin, they were nice representations.pros:1) primarily, there is very good detail in the molding.were it not for the variance in description versus actual product, i would have ranked this more highly. as is, though, these eight dinosaurs are nice but not accurately represented by the product listing. kgharris, 4/14.note: i was offered a sample of this product in which to provide an honest review.",Negative,Negative,0.88455915

"deal breaker appears to be the type of game whose target audience could be the twenty something crowd. when the twenty something guy in my family came over looking to see if we had an actual yahtzee game, i showed him this one. it was an immediate turnoff and he wasn&#8217;t one bit interested. i think that the 18+ age range for the game is probably necessary for screening because some of the deal breaker cards are some you wouldn&#8217;t want your young teen to read. the age group for which this game is intended, is simply not interested. they are looking for &#8220;the one&#8221; and this game, well ... it&#8217;s a bit too immature.the premise of the game is to have the other players (you need at least three) to figure out what might be a &#8220;deal breaker&#8221; for you in a relationship. there are a couple of stacks of coaster-sized cards (4&#8221; x 4&#8221;), red ones that are labeled &#8220;deal breaker&#8221; and the green ones that say &#8220;all good.&#8221; the youngest player goes first. there are two scenarios on each card. perhaps everything is all good with the world or one of these scenarios could be a deal breaker. in other words, it&#8217;s goodbye time to the relationship. each person selects one random card from each deck.it you are the focus, you listen to the person read one of the scenarios from one of their cards. would this scenario be a deal breaker for you or all good? you can slide a card that indicates your choice on to the table. if you think all would be well with the scenario and this imaginative person could be &#8220;the one,&#8221; you&#8217;d place your all good card face down (colored side down) on the table. the other players will have to guess what you are thinking and place one face down as well. scoring goes according to how the guessing goes.these coasters, which remind me of bar coasters are pretty much the same quality. cheap, disposable, and probably wouldn&#8217;t last with a lot of use. the questions are rather silly for the twenty something crowd, but would probably titillate teens who might snag them. the twenty somethings i know are trying to disconnect somewhat from the high-tech world around them and get back down to earth with games they may have played from their childhood. not ones like party until you puke, but rather the good old standards like monopoly, yahtzee, or parcheesi. the idea of zobmondo&#8217;s deal breaker is interesting, but falls short of what their target audience is looking for. i&#8217;ll tap out a few random deal breaker scenarios so you&#8217;ll get the idea. not recommended because my twenty something took one look at it and pretty much dissed it.deal breaker scenarios:&#9658; &#8220;you are on a first date together and your date says the price of your menu selections and then whistles under their breath ...&#8221;&#9658; &#8220;you are on your first date with someone who is smoking hot but has a missing tooth, which is really obvious when they talk.&#8221;&#9658; &#8220;you are on your fifth date and things are going great, except your partner is a horrible kisser and doesn&#8217;t seem to be improving.&#8221;&#9658; &#8220;you are on a first date and the person is amazing. they&#8217;ve recently dyed their hair bright purple and they say they love it.&#8221;&#9658; &#8220;you&#8217;ve been on a few dates and really like the person when you notice that your partner has freakishly huge hands.&#8221;",Negative,Negative,0.6254667

"wow, this is really one of the worst toys ever, and i feel i am pretty easygoing and forgiving when it comes to toy ratings. talk about a pointless toy. you put the car on the &#34;stairs&#34; and then push it up to the top and let it go down where a big alligator chomps down on the car which the car tries to knock a piece of &#34;gold&#34; out of the alligator's mouth.except all that part about the alligator? it doesn't work. sure, if you manage to hit it just right, maybe it kind of grabs the car, and you're supposed to send another car (not included) to the rescue. that car hits the alligator in the eye to kind of reset the whole thing.if it worked and did something cool, that would be one thing. but it doesn't work the way it's supposed to very often, and what it doesn't isn't cool, it's just kind of pointless.move along, move along -- there's nothing to see here.",Negative,Negative,0.99818534

"my son is a bit too young to play with the matchbox mission: croc escape playset so i took the opportunity to try this toy out with my 9yr old nephew recently and gauge his reaction and fun with the toy. the playset is designed for children 3-10.the very first thing you have to know is that adult assembly is required. though my nephew was able to help me out it still took a solid 10-15 minutes to get the set assembled. my first impression wasn't great - the track is rather large and cumbersome and seemingly not very well made. the highlight is definitely the die-cast off-road truck that comes with the set. but this set only includes one vehicle. the other major detraction is that the toy doesn't break down easily for storage. my son's closet includes several large deep drawers that we use to store toys. this playset is entirely too large for those and has to be stored in his room on the floor.for its size the set has limited fun potential. there is a car elevator to ascend a set of jungle stairs, the ramp with a few obstacles/traps and then the crocodile jaws which can clamp shut and trap the die-cast truck. that's it. for the price of the set i understand that there are limitations but by itself this toy is extremely limited in its entertainment value. there are additional tracks and cars that can be purchased and build on each other but at added expense.for my nephew this was an interesting diversion for about 10 minutes before he wanted to do something else. my advice is to pass on this toy unless you're looking to build out a large set with multiple vehicles.",Negative,Negative,0.7315315

"we tried these and another boomco gun with my son, 7, and a group of his friends. while they had a decent time running around the yard firing at each other, all of them said they vastly preferred their existing nerf guns to these and, in fact, i found these discarded off to the side in the yard while the nerf guns were still in use.i can't say i disagree with them. these are very small--even slightly older kids found them awkwardly little--and feel flimsy. to fire you have to first insert the dart, it holds only one in the chamber, and then pull back, hard, on the plunger on the back to fire. it's a time consuming and, to kids, frustrating process. the darts themselves are also flimsy. hollow and thin-walled it's hard not to bend them when inserting them into either the chamber or the handle storage space. we have already broken one tip off in less than 30 minutes of active play and, as i was watching the whole time, i can attest no one was being especially wild or careless.the big innovation touted here is that the darts stick only to specially designed, and sold, targets, one of which is included here. well, it kind of works, if you're the exact right distance away and firing at the exact right speed but, again, after a time two, interest was lost quite quickly. these darts also hurt if they hit you far more than nerf. i'm not sure why, as they seem equally soft, but especially at closer range these cause quite a sting and would be dangerous should they hit an eye.all in all, just not much to recommend with so many better nerf options out there.",Negative,Negative,0.69852877

"someone made a really bad decision with this game, to sell it with no box.  if you collect games, and like to put them all on a shelf together, this one really messes up the system.  it is true that it compresses down to a board and a &#34;storage&#34; base, but lots of games could be broken into component parts of a board and a small bag or box of component pieces--but you wouldn't want to have to store them that way!  it would be a mess.  and in this case, the &#34;storage&#34; base is a disaster waiting to happen--it stores zillions of little cards as well as a few other things, and the &#34;snapping in&#34; feature of the top is not very sturdy.  all it would take would be to be knocked onto the floor (which is easy, because, you know, there's no box) and you will have a catastrophe of little cards everywhere.  i don't know about your kids, but it's not hard for me to imagine mine accidentally knocking this base off the shelf!but, that said, i'll still give it two stars.  the game itself is just ok.  the window sits in the base, but not very stably, which is very awkward when you're trying to draw quickly.  it kept falling over when we were using it.  plus some of the new ways to play are not fun--having to draw on the window with your finger while your partner traces with the marker on the other side left us feeling very frustrated.  the &#34;action&#34; feature where you draw something and then use that picture to act out an action turned out to be really hard to communicate.  i also thought there was an assumption about many of the clues that maybe most adults would know, but the game is rated for 8 and up, and i encountered a ton of clues that meant nothing to my 8 year old.  very frustrating.and yet, it wasn't awful.  we are a gaming family, but this definitely won't be one we'll choose very often.  every now and then, however, it might be a change of pace.  assuming, that is, i can manage to keep all the pieces together with no box to store them in.",Negative,Negative,0.7736711

"okay - who doesn't like pictionary?  sadly, this game doesn't live up to it's predecessors.as a side note - there is no storage box for this product.  the product is packaged in clam shell plastic and once removed, you have a 2 piece yellow and white storage base (for the playing cards, die, timer, and marker) and the plastic clear frame that fits on top of the storage base.  if you're finicky about games always returning to the box you'll need to get over it as there is no storage box for the pieces.the timer only allows 30 seconds to draw the picture and have it guessed by the opposing team.  seriously - 30 seconds?  what kid (or adult for that matter) can produce a drawing and correctly guess the clue in that limited amount of time?  the timer is worthless and we resorted to using the timer on a cell phone rather than to keep flipping the timer over for more time.the marker provided is painfully inadequate.  it is very very light and does not provide crisp bold lines.  if you are interested in this game, you are better off using the neon dry erase markers (which show up great) or some other dry erase marker as the one provided can barely be seen (we used quartet glo-write neon markers and the enduraglide markers - both are for dry-eraser boards).  the provided marker (as well as our personal markers) leave the screen cloudy after it is cleaned.  you will need to really buff the screen with a damp cloth and then dry it before each use before moving onto the next team's turn.  since the screen doesn't clean quickly, this slows down the game.another downside to this game is that it is designed to be played in teams.  if you have only 2 kids - they will be unable to play it by themselves without significantly improvising the rules.  you'll therefore need 4 or more players to develop 2 teams.the difference in this game is that the playing cards are broken down into 3 categories:  action frame (draw the clue and use the frame to &#34;act&#34; out the clue), mirror/mirror (the person drawing the clue doesn't use the marker - they use their finger and the other team member uses the marker on the other side of the clear screen to trace their partner's finger to create the drawing), and classic (simply draw the picture - and your team provides guesses).  you roll the provided die, select the playing card of your choice and the number on the die outlines what clue you draw (roll a 6 and you pick from the 5 clues).  the first player who acquires one card of all three categories (action, mirror/mirror, and classic) wins.  opposing teams can challenge and win cards from their competitors by correctly guessing the answer after the time has run out.the age of play suggests 8 and above.  many of the clues are way out of the ballpark for kids that are younger.  for example, some of the clues for action include:  get sworn-in, grease the wheel, catch a greased pig, deliver a eulogy, etc.  clues for the mirror/mirror included:  comet, ladle, menorah, contact lens, and queen bee.  clues for classic included: ferret, goth, hair raiser, stumbling block, etc.  in other words, many of the clues are really difficult - and they expected you to draw these clues in 30 seconds.my kids (age 7 and 10) got bored very quickly and we often had to help explain what the clue was (which further complicated the game as the person helping obviously couldn't challenge and possibly steal the card since they already knew the answer).this game wouldn't be my first selection if i wanted to play pictionary.  if you are playing with adults - it will be very challenging.  if you want to include kids - it's almost impossible to keep their interest due to the frustration of trying to draw the difficult clues.if you choose to purchase this game, i would encourage you to definitely be open to modifying the rules (based upon age level playing) and replace the timer and the marker.",Negative,Positive,0.4825629
"how can you review a book you haven't read? that's my usual response when i read comments declaring why the reviewer didn't really make it through the entire book because of some major concerns.well, now i am reviewing something that i haven't fully tested.the pictionary frame game is a pretty unfortunate attempt to &#34;update&#34; an old classic game, but it fails on so many levels that we haven't ever been able to get a game going following the new instructions.problems start out with the drawing frame itself. as has already been pointed out, the lack of a game box is in itself awkward (still have this sitting on a shelf while trying to figure out how to store it), but this could be overlooked if the format of a stand up frame for drawing the game pictures worked.it doesn't.if you lay the frame on the table and draw on it for stability, it works, but then that takes away the advantage of everyone being able to see the picture as it is drawn. however, for most normally adept adults and children, trying to hold the frame steady while drawing on it in an upright position ends up making the drawings even more incoherent than they might normally be. add to that the small size of the frame, especially for those of us who have grown used to playing pictionary on whiteboards or even flipchart paper (yes, some of us have been known to go so far, especially when there are large groups playing), and you will begin to get the picture (pun intended) of the problems with this screen.now move on to one of the &#34;new&#34; kinds of cards--action. quite frankly, our crew tested a couple of these and realized that they could get better effects by laying down the marker and screen and just acting out the clues. anyone every hear of &#34;charades?&#34;then there is the mirror, mirror category. now the person who knows what is the clue will take his or her finger and &#34;draw&#34; on one side of the screen, while a teammate takes the marker and traces those finger movements, all the while that the rest of the team is trying to figure out what is being drawn. when we tried a test drive of this, there were very large problems, chief of which was trying to have two people do this while the rest of the group has enough visibility to even try to guess what is being drawn. and all this in 30 seconds or less.ah yes, another problem. thirty seconds to draw a picture? really? unless the group decides to let the draw-er spend an extended amount of time thinking of where they will start with the idea, this is sadly insufficient for almost any of the clues, especially (again) given the difficulty in drawing on an upright frame and having such a small screen that the entire team can't really see the drawing well at once.oh, and the marker is not &#34;dry-erase;&#34; it is &#34;wet erase&#34; (says so right in the instructions!), so you need to have a wet (not just lightly moist either) paper towel or cloth handy for wiping the screen between each use. better have a dry cloth too, unless you want to wait out the air drying time by singing songs or otherwise occupying your time.so why did i give this two stars? i guess i just couldn't go all the way to one star when we really never got to a full-blown game. and we will be pulling some of the cards and mixing them in with our classic pictionary game; in fact, trying this out reminded us of how long it had been since we'd played the original. yes, some of those clues are now a little dated, but we just go past those if they are a problem for any of the younger players. the screen (with real dry erase markers) is something that a few of the kids are having fun with, creating their own ideas of fun, so all is not lost...and we are still trying to come up with our own made up game that can use a 30 second timer, since the quality of that piece seems pretty good.overall, avoid this but, if you have it given to you as a gift, try to get creative in how you use all the parts!",Negative,Negative,0.85744035
"this pictionary frame game is lacking a storage box and that is my biggest complaint! i'm sad to say, my children have already successfully lost the dice. we keep most games organized and stored on the shelf in our finished basement, but this game comes in a blister package with no way to store it unless you hunt down your own--what, shoebox?playing the game itself isn't necessarily convenient because it's much easier to play with a larger whiteboard or drawing pad than this tablet-sized screen that some players can't even get close enough to see if you're playing with more than a couple people. i can see how some might like it, especially pictionary fanatics, but for most families i feel like this just isn't worth it.followed by the fact that you just don't need this game when you can buy a small whiteboard and dry erase marker and there you go: same thing. i feel like this would have been a keeper if it had come with a storage box, and perhaps... but i just can't get over the fact that this is just a small screen/whiteboard in a flashy, blister package and so...what's the point? i can't recommend it, unfortunately.",Negative,Negative,0.9336237
"i was really excited about this product, as pictionary is one of my all-time favorite party games.  this was a disappointment on so many levels.first, there is no storage box.  it comes with a frame, a frame stand, a timer, and a marker.  and a dice, which got lost in no time.  the &#34;frame&#34; itself is about the size of a sheet of paper (8&#34; by 10&#34;), and it is clear, so you can see through it. the small size makes it ideal for  travel or a backpack, but the fact that it is clear makes it difficult to see when holding it on your lap.  and forget about using it on the black coffee table.  it works much better when used flat, on a light background surface.  i like that you can use the frame as a window, so the see-through feature may be useful one at a time.  it's pretty much impossible for two people to write on opposite sides of  the board at the same time.  honestly it is pretty much for anyone to write on the board when it is in the stand, which keeps the board vertical.we like to use large dry-erase boards when we pay pictionary.  i would recommend that rather than this game.  the frame might be fun to draw on once in a while -- but shy not get a small whiteboard, which is much better suited for the purpose?",Negative,Negative,0.8640493

"the first thing that we noticed right away is that this set only comes with one wrestler. i understand that additional items may be sold separately but i'm really get tired of the new trend in toys where needed items are sold separately. i mean seriously, how can you wrestle with one guy? two people is sort of the point in wrestling, it's not a single person sporting event.assembly was frustrating for my 7 year old and me. although there was detailed pictured instructions, assembly was awkward and confusing. many steps, we just had to take and let my husband figure out how to assemble it. he figured it out quickly. so let's just say, you have to have the right kind of brain to do this and obviously i don't.the set itself is a wrestling ring with areas where the action figure can be launched from and crash into. the set is cheap and flimsy. the wall that is the bank vault is backwards to the ring and it was strange that you play on the back side. i see it falling apart and having to be reassembled often. my son was frustrated that the box that contains the championship belt kept coming apart when he didn't want it to.within minutes, my son was playing with the action figure alone and left the wrestling ring sitting on the floor.",Negative,Negative,0.9762048

"here&#8217;s a riddle for you:  what company name excites children merely by saying it; generates great expectations for both the giver and recipient of the gift; and keenly disappoints?  . . . . . . .(waiting for your answer)  give up?  it&#8217;s disney!  yup, i was surprised, too.this looked like a toy that&#8217;s a bit different from the rest; it involves racing airplanes.  but sadly, innovation ends with the concept.  i&#8217;ll explain.after following the directions, assembly was easy (adult required, but no batteries).  however, contrary to the directions, applying the decals prior to assembly is more practical.the toy is lightweight and rather flimsy.  rugged play will cause it to come apart at a portion of the track where two sections meet.  the airplane holds up just fine.seeing this toy in play reminds me of watching a hamster running on its wheel.  the hamster&#8217;s action doesn&#8217;t change; it does the same movement repeatedly.  boring!  the child playing with this toy repeats the same action&#8212;pulls back the lever, releases the lever, watches the plane circle track, repeat&#8212;ad nauseum.  and that&#8217;s it.  neither thinking nor creativity, nor imagination is required.  (as a parent and educator it rates an &#8216;f&#8217;, in my opinion.)  i would not waste my money on it nor, would i allow my child to play with such mindless tripe.  the box states that after 10 laps, the track opens up and the plane flies to the &#8216;finish&#8217;.  the only finish we see is the breaking of the track and the plane falling down.the box depicts a child playing with this set, clearly showing multiple aircraft and a truck.  in a prominent 2.5&#8221; circle it states, &#8220;fly 2 planes!&#8221;  however, the reality is that it contains one plane, one track and control tower.  there is no other plane.  the truck doesn&#8217;t exist.  in tiny print (font size of about a three or four) it states:  &#8220;vehicles and sets each sold separately.&#8221;  really??!  so, if your pre-schooler (who can&#8217;t read and relies on pictures) sees this toy and asks for it, s/he will be keenly disappointed once it&#8217;s opened and assembled.  adults buying this as a gift will probably not read the fine print either, thinking this is a wonderful present for a young child.i am annoyed by a couple of things.  first, disney&#8217;s representation of what&#8217;s inside the box is inaccurate.  second, with so many engaging play items on the market, money and time should not be wasted with this item.  disney&#8217;s name invokes imagination and good quality.  if this set is indicative of the company&#8217;s standards today, i will be wary of future disney products.",Negative,Negative,0.97929984

"yeah it's fun, for about 5 minutes. it's such a one-dimensional toy - it's basically a timing game, pull the trigger at the right moment to get the plane to go faster. how long could that possibly last? it requires zero imagination or creative skills.the other good point is there are no batteries or ac adapters to worry about, it's all manual (just a lever to pull). but there are so many bad points:* only comes with one plane, so you need to buy extra parts if you're really going to play it properly* it takes up a lot of space, and it doesn't pack up well. it won't fit back into the box it came in* the planes themselves are clunky - you have to attach it to a harness device, makes it a lot less fun* it is pretty flimsy, as other reviewers have pointed out, and it can fall apart with rough play (which you're supposed to do)* by itself it doesn't make a lot of sense, there's no hanger, no garage to park the planes, etc. you need to buy other pieces & sceneryi definitely recommend looking elsewhere for a gift for your child. it's a little difficult for a 4 year old, but once you get over 6, it's a little rudimentary, i just don't see this holding anyone's attention very long.if you child likes planes, i recommend getting them a remote controlled plane or helicopter, for the same price (or less) it would provide hours of fun. you could also try a lego type product, where they can build their own plane, while working on some creative and tactile skills.",Negative,Negative,0.8372213
"fun: 2 out of 5 starsdurability: 2 out of 5 starseducational value: 3 out of 5 starsthis is an interesting toy. if your kid is into planes between and is between ages 3-6, he or she will love it when you open the package. however, kids will get bored of this very quickly. why? there is nothing they can do to play except pull the handle. after a few minutes, pulling this handle can get very boring even for adults - let alone kids. there is no other distractions this play set offers.  with only one plane, there is not even a race involved.this play set is not durable. it seems that the thin plastic can easily be broken. the assembly may require adult involvement. what is really bad is that it is not rigid when assembled so it will keep falling apart when kids try to move it around. definitely not a good design.i think there are better toys out there but if your kid loves everything to do with planes, he or she might love it. also, although it says it is suitable for ages 4-10, i don't see how a 7 yo would enjoy such a toy that offers such limited interactivity.",Negative,Negative,0.81653464
"the concept is slick at least - like a suspended roller coaster, and a shuttle that rides on the track.  it actually worked quite well for the three or so minutes my son was able to play with it.assembly is quick - 5 minutes, and it's assembled, another minute or so for stickers.  the lever movement is quite smooth, and pulling the lever spins an arm on the track that pushes against the shuttle, launching the plane along the track.it comes with two shuttles but only one plane.  fortunately we had a planes aircraft carrier that had another version of the plane with it that has the hole in the bottom so we had two planes right off the bat to run on this.  it can push two at once, but the prop on the rear got stuck in the tail assembly of the front one, so while they'd push, they were joined the whole run.  with good timing, you can get the one going, then drop the other from the top of the spiral, and get one flying behind the other and nudge each as it goes, keeping them both running separately.my son did enjoy it for a few minutes, but as with most toys like this, the enjoyment is limited since it gets old pretty quick.but worse than that, there's a small trigger on the bottom section that lowers the track, which is where you slide plane shuttles on or off the track.  you push it back up and the track locks into place until you press that trigger, which lets it drop again.  we used the trigger once, to open the track to put the planes on, then closed the track for use.  within a few minutes of normal use, without even touching the trigger again, it broke and the track won't stay &#34;closed&#34; anymore.the &#34;finish&#34; line part won't stay up on carpet, so if you want the planes to be able to knock that down, put this on a hard floor.they should've just used a twisting piece of plastic that turns under the piece of track that lowers, to hold it in place, rather than the mechanism they used.  then this couldn't happen.  meanwhile, this didn't even last for as many minutes as it took to assemble it.  i was watching him the whole time and know he didn't hit it or even bump it or do anything at all, nor did he overdo the handle for launching the planes.had it worked, it might've been worth it for the novelty, even if it wears off pretty quick, but i'll never recommend a toy that doesn't even last 5 minutes before breaking.",Negative,Negative,0.9959604

"the idea of this toy is pretty cool, and of course you can see successful models from car tracks (powered or matchbox type), but this unfortunately gets boring very quickly.and considering how much of an airplane maniac my 4yo is, that is saying a lot.my biggest gripe as a parent though, is that this is a poorly constructed, flimsy plastic junk toy.  specifically, there is a &#34;button&#34; you have to engage and disengage that supposedly holds the track together after you open a section to be able to attach a plane.  it's so poorly made, that after about 10 openings and closings of the track, it would not stay closed, essentially making the entire thing useless.we actually had another plane that fits this set (not knowing that it was even part of a set like this), so we were able to try out two planes.  for the reviewer who mentioned they wanted to try and find another plane to see two in action....don't bother.  really no &#34;racing&#34; involved at all here, and unfortunately, not even very fun.on a positive note, i will say it was pretty interesting and fun for the first 10 minutes.  after that, i don't think any of my three kids have even looked at it.this is yet another &#34;all sizzle, no staying power&#34; toys that flood the market.sorry to say i can't recommend this.  there is a powered car track that is awesome (cars based), or i would even recommend the new, fancy hotwheels trick tracks, which have some very cool stuff, now.  both recommended if you want a track toy, over this.",Negative,Negative,0.993119
"this went to my four year old son to play with.  he recently watched the new lego batman movie (based on the video game) and was interested in superman and batman fighting a giant joker robot...just as in the movie.  a couple of notes:-apparently the idea here is for superman and batman to stand still while the joker robot saunters up between them and quick-as-lightning smashes its hands down and captures them.  trouble is, you have to have supes and bats standing in a very precise spot, with arms close to their bodies, and remain standing while the kid squeezes the robot's legs together.  unfortunately, this rarely if ever happened.  instead one would get knocked to the ground where he could (presumably) save the other from joker's grasp.  or something.  anyway, it made my son start crying with frustration that he couldn't get it to work, the figures wouldn't stand up because of the odd dimensions of the casting, etc etc.-the arms of the robot rotate forward so you can have bats and supes standing next to each other and get captured by the robot facing them.  but again, unless the stars are aligned and there's a variable gravity field under the figures to keep them from falling or something, it just doesn't work right.-not to get pedantic, but the batman insignia looks off somehow.  if this weren't a mattel product i'd wonder if this was even officially licensed.  not that my four year old cares, but, well, i do.  the superman figure also has a somewhat odd (to me) costume on.-the figures themselves look strange, with dimensions that just seem off.  the capes are normal at the bottom but taper to a very narrow point at the neck...i think they'll detach sooner rather than later.-after about twenty minutes my son stopped playing with the joker robot and instead played with bats and supes.overall, it's an interesting idea but it just didn't work.",Negative,Negative,0.99814177

"this &#34;action&#34; figure was a bit of a disappointment. the concept is that steel the alien morphs into the combined flying hero max steel. fans of the transformers might be tempted to pick this one up, but fight that urge.to be clear, the idea of this figure is a good one. out of the box, max steel is in flight mode - ready to blast off into his many adventures. he really looks kind of cool. in the center of max's chest is a crank that brings the wings down and collapses the legs. this turns our human hero into the mechanical steel. then, in the center of the crank is a button that pops max back into flight mode.so what could be wrong with this cool transferring action figure ? well, a lot of the issues revolved around max and his spring-loaded weapon. it should be held in max's hand, but the flight mode wings really keep the arm from swiveling up to be parallel with the ground. as a result, max can only carry his rifle by the handle, as if it were a lunchbox. and then, in alien mode the gun pegs into the back of the robot. this doesn't seem like it should be bad at all. only, it plugs in right next to a handle, so that you can not use the handle to fly around the robot.if you only plan to play with max in flight mode, and not use his gun, its probably a good display piece. but this is a toy. it should be a lot of fun for kids to play with. but with all of the design flaws, one has to wonder how this thing passed quality assurance. at twenty dollars, kids (and collectors ?) deserve much better treatment from the nice folks at mattel.",Negative,Negative,0.9548468
"i had initially posted a 5 star review on this item. however, that was before this was opened and used. it was a christmas gift for my 10 year old daughter. it did arrive quickly and the packaging looked good.however, now for the cons. the loom/board broke within a week of her using it. i super glued it back together and that lasted a few more days. the rubber bands that come with this seem to be thin and break easily. it's frustrating for my daughter to complete a bracelet and start carefully take it off of the loom and have rubber bands break. she then has to take everything apart and start all over. she's careful with it too.at the time of placing this order i wasn't all that familiar with these bracelet making kits. i've done more research and ordered her one straight from the name brands website. it was affordable and shipping was under $1.50. can't beat that!!ahh well so this wasn't a hit. lesson learned. this is one of those cases that you get what you pay for.",Negative,Negative,0.81275874

"my kids are huge fans of k'nex in general, and we own quite a few of the k'nex educational sets.  we were so excited to open the high quality k'nex green box which is perfect for storing not only the parts, but even has extra room for storing partially constructed creations.the set itself comes with not only the regular k'nex you need, but also specialty parts such as a solar panel, a motor, and a capacitor.  the first thing we noticed is that there are not a lot of projects in the manual. many of the pages are translations of instructions for the solar cell.  then there are instructions to build a solar car, a crank man, and a shuttle ride.  that's right - just 3 projects in the book.  granted there is a teacher's guide online, but i would have hoped the set would have come with more than 3 projects.my daughter built the solar car and proceeded to ask me why it didn't work.  she held it up to the light in her bedroom, we tried a bright flashlight, she took it outside, etc.  nothing worked.  i finally removed the solar panel and motor and held it directly up to a bright halogen desklight.  it proceeded to weakly advance forward.  i don't know if the solar panel is defective or not, but it just doesn't work in my set.there is also a capacitor, presumably for storing charge, but no directions in any of the projects as to where and how to use it.  they just assume you will know.we love k'nex and this educational series is normally so good, but we were let down by this set.  my daughter, noticing how little energy was generated from solar, grabbed the motor from another k'nex set and powered her car with batteries.  she then asked me, &#34;is this why we don't use more solar power today?&#34;  wow... maybe a little too educational?2 stars.  i love k'nex but this set was a miss for us.",Negative,Negative,0.97896284
"the imaginext alpha explorer has many options for imaginative play, but, somehow, kids still find it boring.  kids most like playing with the space shuttle and imagining the astronauts role in the launch.  as a parent, i did not like the projectiles.  first, kids tend to lose them quite easily, as they are not very large.  second, i think they are dangerous as they can hit other children or even the launcher.the sounds don't add much to the fun.  they are, in fact, quite loud, and take away from children's creativity.i'd recommend this toy for the 4-6 year old age range.  there are too many small pieces for children under 4 years old, and children over 6 years old will be bored by the toys' functionality.  all in all, however, there more fun space toys for the same age group.",Negative,Negative,0.7234277

"**first of all, it is imperative if you are considering buying this to understand something i failed to grasp when i made the decision to buy it: it is not a real train.  first of all, the locomotive of a real train typically weighs something on the order of a hundred tons and runs easily to 60 feet in length, so i guess i should have figured out right after the box arrived that it couldn't possibly contain a real train, which would also include at least one car behind the engine because otherwise it wouldn't be a train, right?also, a real train would cost way, way more than $26.49, right?i now realize, of course, that this is a toy train.  it's meant for little kids to play with.  so, if you thought this was a real train, stop reading now and do not buy thomas the train: take-n-play spills and thrills.  besides, little kids are not allowed to drive real trains, just as they are not allowed to drive real jetliners or perform brain surgery or operate north korea.**given that it is, i remind you, a toy train, it must be reviewed on that basis.  if i were a little kid i would find the product disappointing.  first, i'd be unhappy that my adult had to assemble it, because if i were capable of assembling it myself i'd be too old to enjoy it.  second, i'd be disappointed that my adult would have to stand it against a wall or something to get it to stay straight.  and i'd be disappointed that the &#34;take-n-play&#34; aspect of the name of the product is misleading at best in the sense that neither you nor your adult can just grab the handle provided and throw it in the adult's car and drive it to a pal's house and grab it again and take it inside to show it off to that pal.also, if i were a little kid young enough to enjoy how gravity makes the engine roll down the curvy track (which it doesn't do successfully half the time), i'd miss the little tricks that take place, and if i were old enough to appreciate them i'd be bored after about ten runs.  at $2.649 cents per run, i'd prefer that my adult had invested that money in my college fund.too much adult investment in time and money for not enough entertainment.also, in case you're wondering, this product doesn't work well underwater or in a zero-gravity environment such as the iss.**",Negative,Negative,0.8820686

"my daughters love the disney princesses and they love their bath time. the disney princess water palace bath playset seems like a perfect toy for them, but the reality is that it's underwhelming in almost every way. when putting it together, the pieces go together well enough, but the problem is that they don't stay together all that well. getting the princess (ariel in this case...just ariel) into the swing can also require a bit more dexterity than a three year-old can manage (or have the patience for). the slide doesn't work all that well (ariel's arms get stuck) and the little ""flower launcher"" literally throws ariel out at such a trajectory that the whole thing looks pretty painful for her (not to mention the fact that getting her into the ""launcher"" properly is an ordeal in and of itself). the recommended ages say that it's for 3 to 10 year olds (quite a range), but i can see younger children being frustrated with this and older ones just being bored by it.not everything about it is terrible. the playset is suitably cute, and the way ariel's petal skirt opens to make her float on the water was the one thing that did provide a good bit of entertainment for the girls (it's lined with foam on the underside, making it very buoyant). ariel still gets played with quite a bit at bathtime. the playset, not so much (it's in pieces in their toybox at this point).",Negative,Negative,0.9679957

(i might also add that if anyone is in fear that the pig sounds like the nasal, and annoying maxwell from the geico commercials need not worry. it is voiced by a rather pleasant and calm sounding child.) unfortunately the childs automatic response is to reach for the toy, and pry its mouth open. so i can see why the parent has to be there to pull the toy away.the flap on the bottom only has one small piece of velcro to cover the access hole for the battery compartment. i'm surprised by this. gund has in my experience made soft, sturdy toys and i found this to be rather flimsy as the flap will literally gape and hang open. i shouldn't have to fix it, but i did.for decorative purposes it is very cute, but it seems wrong to call this a toy when a child can not interact with it without adult supervision. overall, i found it to be disappointing. which is too bad, because it is so very cute.",Negative,Negative,0.9301454

"we received this as an impromptu gift from grandma. let's start with the directions... or rather the lack thereof... the directions that came with this loom were so unclear and unhelpful that we did what everyone else does... go to youtube and watch a couple of how-to videos. well that's when we realized this is the knockoff. this loom is different from the original rainbow loom. the rainbow loom has the center row off-set. this loom has the three rows exactly the same. think of a tic tac toe board. they go straight across. there are also no ""arrows"" like on the rainbow loom. the directions that came with this told us to hook the bands straight up one row... and then what??? the videos on youtube clearly had the bands going zig-zagging. so we tried to zig zag as best we could with this loom.  quite difficult to do since the rows are not off-set like the original loom. so the bands were stretched to their fullest... but we did not get any breaking like the other reviewer.  but because we zig-zagged, this made the row shorter and the bracelet is not as long as it would have been with the original rainbow loom. yes, we got it... or rather grandma got it after re-watching the youtube video about 5 times. (wait 'til i tell my husband that we got his mother to use youtube!) now she's going to see if she can show my 8 year old daughter how to do it herself tomorrow morning (mommy wasn't watching closely enough since i was in the middle of something else).  but this will be just a temporary thing for us.  grandma had bought two of these looms (one for each daughter). after today, the decision was to return the unopened one and go to michaels and purchase the real rainbow loom and the girls will share.oh, and another difference was that this kit came with only 1 ""c"" hook... and about 30 hooks that i would call ""s"" hooks... hmmmmm.the only nice thing about this loom was that it did come with six charms to add onto the bracelets. we didn't have any issues with the bands like the other reviewer had.***************update 11/4/2013***************please note that i did change my review from 1 star to 2 stars.okay, i still stand by my review that this loom stinks.  however, i did want to point out that my daughter (8.5 yrs, 3rd grade) started bringing her loom in to school so she could make bracelets, etc. at recess with the other kids.  in doing so, one of the girls at recess was able to move the center row by taking the purple pieces at the bottom off, moving the row, and then putting the purple pieces back on... to be honest, i really don't know how.  when i tried to do it, i felt i wasn't strong enough (or talented enough) to do so... and couldn't. my daughter tried it at home too without success... but this one kid was able to do it. when i asked my daughter how, she replied that she just ""pulled hard"".  we chalked it up to the fact that maybe the kid was pretty strong (and persistent) b/c i still can't do it.so now that you can move the pegs to make it look like the ""real"" one, it's not so bad. by the time we figured out that the pegs could be moved, my daughter had received a new ""real"" rainbow loom from grandma in the mail.  so she mostly uses the real rainbow loom but sometimes uses this loom too.  this one still makes smaller bracelets though... even when you move the center row. i'm not sure why & i really don't feel like figuring out why either... just glad i didn't waste my money on this one even though it was probably cheaper. but it is nice to have a back-up loom for when two kids want to work on the loom and the other kid doesn't have one.as a result of now knowing that you can move the pegs, i did change it from 1 star to 2 stars... but it's still stinky just for the fact that it is soooooo difficult to do so. and it still makes smaller bracelets. and some of the rubber bands do break (but they are not horrible).  i still like the real ""rainbow loom"" much better.",Negative,Negative,0.8760584

"with a msrp of $45 dollars, this version of optimus prime is as pricey as it is ugly. a huge part of the truck remains untransformed in robot form and it looks really tacky. if prime is laid down on his back, he's essentially in truck mode as he can roll around on his wheels. there so much extra ugly plastic in this robot form - far worse than some g1 or go-bot figures. he also has weird flaps at his hips on above his shoulders, which really makes this piece feel like the vehicle mode was the only thing the designers thought about it. the robot form really feels like an afterthought. perhaps the weirdest part is that he essentially has a bra and panties set in an accidentally funny way similar to how you could transform g1 galvatron to make him look...let's say happy to see you. kids are probably reading this after all.vehicle mode looks great though. it is a fantastic rig and the colours and chrome make it one of the best looking bey-verse versions of prime vehicle-wise. it's solid also that piece that just sits unloved on prime's back in robot mode is pretty thin and unflexible so it will break in the hands of a careless or clumsy child.so terrible robot mode and a great vehicle mode would usually balance things out, but with the insane price tag on this prime, i can't really recommend it. there are better aoe primes out there with my personal favorite being the g1 homage:  &#34;evasion modeoptimus prime.&#34; it's half the cost and both modes look great. get that instead.",Negative,Negative,0.9820724

(other sets we have have showed how to transform both ways). second, the tail that is supposed to go on grimlock in dino mode is really ill-fitting. it is hard to get it in there and often falls off. third, half of grimlock's head broke off at the swivel point for no reason. my son was transforming it, and it simply broke. because it is on a hinge, it can't be super-glued back together, rendering grimlock useless now after having it for less than a month. bummed out because my son really liked the figure.",Negative,Negative,0.99871874

"but this thing is kind of a ripoff.i love toys, love remote control, love seeing kids have fun, love having fun myself. ""i really wanted to like this"" etc. but here are the dealbreakers for me, preceded by the few pluses.yes:the car is fast. it also does jumps and stuff.no:this is for kids, right? so why design it to last only eight minutes??!! do the designers actually have or even know any kids? were they kids themselves, ever? once you get your young teeth into playing with a toy like this, you want to just keep rocking for a while...not 8 minutes, then pull the battery out and recharge it for 15 minutes then try to get all excited again. that's just not how kids work. they should have included two batteries, or a bigger one that lasts at least 20-30 minutes.the car battery charges from other batteries! four aa batts go dead within four charges of the car battery or so. even with rechargeable batts, that's a pain. with normal batts, it's a lot of money for parents to be shelling out, over and over.the car careens off the playfield a lot. which is fun for a while, then gets old. (and running the car on any carpet picks up lint fast and the wheels seize up.)you can't control direction with the remote...?! just going straight is no great joy after a while, especially as the car flies off the field so often.60 bucks is way too much for this. it's all made of cheap plastic, you have to put on all the cheap-looking stickers, and when it's all done and you're charging the car battery off the controller that uses other batteries that you just charged and will have to again in an hour or so, you might just think, ""i paid 60 bucks for this?""most kids these days have attention spans of next to nothing, so making them wait every 8 minutes for 15 minutes to start having fun with their new toy again is just bad design, period.i've played with lots of rc cars and lots of tracks and this one is near the bottom of the heap, as the only thing is has going for it is a fast car.......that lasts less than ten minutes at a time.this is worth 30 bucks, and even then would be aggravating.not recommended.",Negative,Negative,0.570322
"that's what my son said when he realized that the burnout marks on the display box were in fact pre-printed on set's cardboard pieces. he will become jaded before long: the photoshopping on toy boxes is a growing concern. not sure either about the advertised ""scale"" 900 mph, but it's pretty darned fast, no doubt about it.the psychoplex is one of several playsets from kaotiks, all of which can be combined into one giant set. this one took 40 minutes to assemble. mostly straightforward, although plastic and cardboard are not ideal jigsaw mates. couple hints: only at step 4 does it mention to assemble on a smooth surface, but i recommend a very hard surface from the very start, the better to snap pieces together. another tip: the green fencing goes flat(ter) side in. unfortunately, pieces are not numbered in accordance with the instructions. the long green fencing, for example, is called out as part ""l"" in the instructions but the actual pieces are stamped ""s12."" also, pieces ""m"" and ""n"" are ""p2"" and ""p1,"" respectively. finally, the instructions do not mention the included stickers, the placement of only some of which are indicated on the box.the stated run time is 8 minutes, but thankfully our real-world experience is better. the car runs for 20 minutes, but takes almost as long to recharge. battery installation/replacement is not intuitive, both for the controller (which uses 4 aa batteries, not included) and the car (which uses a li-on battery, included). the battery compartment in the controller uses sliding plastic tabs to separate each pair of batteries. most devices require no such contraption, so i don't see the point. the car battery is tricky to install and remove, especially so for the stated age range (4+). the aa batteries will not last long*, since they do double duty in powering the controller and also charging the li-on. the controller uses infa-red optical transmitters, so it must be pointed at the car, which is slightly annoying because even small arm movements may affect the signal.* new aa batteries lasted only four cycles.the car is as spazzy as a mexican jumping bean. keep it away from carpet or it will pick up fuzz. you don't need the track, in fact. much of the time, the car jumps *out* of the track anyway. the car functions the same right side up or down, and seems sturdily designed. like the much worsedisney/pixar cars stunt racers double decker speedway, the vehicle retains playability on its own. the biggest downside in my opinion is the lack of a steering device on the remote. on the track, this is mitigated by the forced oval. on the floor, however, there is no control whatsoever, and you will be constantly placing the car back in the track. what would be cool is to race two cars at the same time. unfortunately, amazon does not list any accessories at this time.postscriptthe title of this review captures my son's initial disappointment at the enhanced graphics of the marketing material. he wanted to burn some rubber. ironically, he has. or at least some medium-density foam. there is black residue all over the track. cool for him, though i wonder what will happen when there is no tire rubber/foam left on the wheels.3 stars. the playability of this toy would be increased exponentially with a steering device. also, the aa batteries lead a cursed life because they not only control the car when the toy is in use, but they also charge the car's battery at all other times.update february 2014--------------------the rechargeable battery stopped charging. (fyi, the red light will stay on.) the company was kind enough to send a replacement battery.update april 2014-----------------the replacement battery has now stopped working, too. ugh.lowering durability rating to 1-star, overall down to 2-star.",Negative,Negative,0.9718797
"maybe i got a defective unit, but the car is impossible to control. it has a mind of its own and spins around randomly. it doesn't go straight and makes random turns and switches directions. pulling the trigger back or pushing it forward had no effect. it just does what it wants.the worst thing about the trigger is that it uses regular aa batteries to charge the special battery for the car, instead of using a wall charger. who thought of this? it's a waste of money. putting the track together was very time-consuming to get all the pieces lined up and snapped in. it definitely requires adult assistance.i helped put this together and played with it with a 10 year old boy and his adult cousin (22). both of them were confused by this product and the wtf behavior of the car. we also noticed skid marks on the arena flooring. after about 10 minutes of use, the bottom of the rear tires got all chewed up and fuzzy like the end of an eraser. the car frequently flies out of the arena.not fun. do not buy.",Negative,Negative,0.99727976
"this is fun at first, but it gets boring after a while.movement of the car is very fast and totally chaotic - you are not steering the car, but it will change direction after bumping into an obstacle (e.g. the outer fence of the course). it also will flip out of the course occasionally, which can get kind of frustrating if that happens a few times in a row. the stunts that the car performs are spectacular, but are really limited to flipping over in midair - once you have seen it a few times, it looses its novelty quickly.the whole toy is made of plastic and especially the fence has a flimsy feeling to it. this was obviously not designed with durability as one of the top goals.but what really infuriates me is the power supply - the car has a rechargeable battery, which you clip into the pistol-grip trigger device, which then loads the rechargeable battery of the car using its own aa batteries in the grip. since one charge only holds for a few minutes, you are draining the aa batteries in the grip at a very fast rate - replacing them will be expensive after a while. and if you use rechargeables for the grip, too, you have to have at least a couple of sets available,  because it takes some time to recharge the rechargeables ...all in all, this playset is fun for a short while and leads to frustration in the long run.",Negative,Negative,0.9616645

"this thing was a pain to assemble. it's assembling something very complex from ikea except the instructions are a lot worse. in fact, they aren't even instructions. they consist of barely discernible black and white images printed on a few sheets of newsprint. assembly was more like a puzzle, trying to match what i was building to the picture on the box.the result is a flimsey though admittedly detailed and colorful castle. it does have lots of nooks (am i allowed to say that here?) and crannies where imagination can run rampant. speaking of rampant imaginations...the shows any number of princess sofia's pals romping around the castle. problem is, they're not included. enter my daughter asking, ""but where are all the other dolls."" it is a shame to begin her play experience with disappointment. another disappointment is that some of the features don't work as promised. the sofia doll does not slide down the banister and the rabbit doesn't ""hide"" in the spinning cushion.now to the talking. the castle doesn't talk. if it did talk it might suggest you buy a different toy but, we're not there yet. everything is ""said"" by placing one of the characters over a small spot on a special pedestal. the small spot has a light/reader that detects the color of the character's feet and determines which of those character's phrases to say. each character only has a few phrases and, as near as i can tell, they're always said in the same order. positioning the character so the ""feet color"" can be properly read is a bit tricky and the instructions even caution against using the toy in a room that is too brightly lit.also, take careful note of the warning about small parts and choking hazards. they are very small, some approaching the size of a pea. even if you are lucky enough to avoid swallowing them, odds are they will get lost in no time. i did laugh that they included a 1"" (ish) tall toy castle to go in the toy castle.ok, now we're ""there"". between the flimsiness, easily lost parts, and ""speaking"" limitations there overall not a lot to recommend about this toy.",Negative,Negative,0.99353397
"this ""castle"" is not worth five dollars.  the day it arrived, i put it together, noting that it is very prone to being easily broken. the next day one of my two grand daughters came over, we had ordered this together, she was so excited. the dolls do not stand up well, ( i also ordered the set of dolls with mom and dad, boy and sister. i had to help my grand daughter every time she wanted to press them on the platform that allows the dolls to talk or make music. she is 6 years old that is old enough to make an item like this easy for her to handle.next pieces of the house kept falling off, the dolls cannot stand, or sit on the stairs, chairs . some of the dolls stand alone the boy dolls stood with difficulty and fell over at the slightest bump.here is the big kicker, while we were trying to put a piece on the 'castle' that kept falling off the castle fell over and it was so fast my grand daughter went with it falling on the second floor  flooring of the castle with one hand, the floor broke in pieces , not fixable.this toy is a piece of junk, my grand daughter was crying of course, thanks disney - ""when you wish upon a star"".... money tells me who you are!60 bucks, a complete and total rip off and 38+ dollars for the set of dolls , can you even imagine, disney you should be ashamed of yourselves and amazon don't tarnish your reputation by selling toys from this company anymore.",Negative,Negative,0.9820915
"as far as small doll houses/castles go, this product doesn't stand out, either for being so great or being so terrible.  its really your run of the mill doll house-like product.  it is fairly strong construction, which is great for my not so easy playing daughter, but it didnt really hold her attention for long (hours).  it seems like in the effort to design a mass-producible doll house, creative corners were taken that make it a less exciting product.  maybe its the lack of a broader color scheme, more interactive elements, but something is missing.  if the product were $20 or even $30, my review would be far less harsh, but at this price point, many other, far better products enter the competitive mix.  generally nice product, just overpriced.",Negative,Negative,0.98345655

"now, i know these figures are primarly targeted at kids and if you're a parent and wanna buy this for your kids you should do so.i think kids will like this figure if they like the character.however, as a collector i'm not too happy with spider bytez.first of all, this figure has the common problem of the current tmnt playmates line by being way to small. in the series, spider bytez was about twice as tall as the turtles, this figure however is by far the smallest of the current tmnt line. even if you add the spider legs to it, it's still just about as tall as a regular tmnt figure.but that's not all. like articulation? spider bytez doesn't have much. the arms move around and the spider legs are fully articulated which is nice but that's it. legs don't move at all and the arm articulation is pretty limited. bottom line is you won't get much posing out of this guy.finally, the body's hollow which just seems really weird. not a huge deal but just why is that?overall spider bytez is a disappointment for collectors. unless you're a completionist like me, i'd say it's an easy pass especially with it not being one of the more prominent characters of the show.",Negative,Negative,0.9976267
my daughter was disappointed in these. they don't really glow in the dark much. i thought they seemed less stretchy than the standard rainbow loom rubber bands so i'm not sure how well they're going to hold up. i guess we'll have to wait and see. i wouldn't buy them again.,Negative,Negative,0.9928411
"it would have ordinarily seemed strange that i had to research rubber bands before buying a bunch of different sets, including this one, for our children. but since rainbow loom is the rage these days, i had to make sure i ordered sets that my boys would be happy with! that being said, i wanted sets that weren't overpriced (i saw other listings for $20 for 300 rubber bands!), came with sufficient supply of s or c clips, and were shipped by amazon so that i could get prime shipping. this set met all criteria. the boys are happy campers having received the rubber bands in 2 days!i ordered this set only because it said it was glow-in-the-dark. turns out it's not. it was in the packaging that is pictured here and had the same title printed on it, so i know i received the correct product. this is the reason i rate it low - because it doesn't glow in the dark as advertised.if you are buying several sets of rubber bands in different colors, i highly recommend an organizer. i boughtartbin 6-compartment tarnish inhibitor medium box, translucent clearand it is a great way to keep all the rubber bands organized and, more importantly, avoid rubber bands from being scattered all over the house!",Negative,Positive,0.42615604

"the manufacturer touts the ""realistic"" look of this bird. well, if you have any semblance of eyesight, ""realistic"" is not even close. let me put it this way - if this looks like a real bird to you, get someone to drive you to the eye doctor or hospital immediately, since you either need some seriously high powered glasses, or you're having a stroke.but looks aside, it has some amusement value. the audio is loud enough to be heard (at least on the one i got) but is overshadowed by the plastic clicking noise made by the moving parts. the movement is mostly limited to the neck. the tail really doesn't move much at all.it sits pretty well on the perch provided that you press in the plastic nubs firmly. it's not easy to hold in your hand since it just flops over.the build quality is pretty poor. i wasn't expecting much, but the quality is less than i expected given the price point. it would be a lot nicer if it actually had some feathers instead of being just molded plastic.i'll give it 2 stars since it did make me chuckle a bit. it's not a good choice for a child since it will not withstand any measure of rough handling. ok for a gag-type gift if you can get it really cheap, but no value beyond that.[sample provided for review]",Negative,Negative,0.96317834

"my little huntress has wanted a slingshot for a while, because after all, who can pretend to be link without a slingshot to go along with the master sword and bow and arrows? and her bow and arrow set is by zing, and we've been pleased with the overall performance of it. so what happened here?!direct quote from the seven year old &#34;i don't use it because i can't even get it to shoot.&#34; ball placement is difficult because the balls have reinforced grooves that must be perfectly matched up to the pegs before pulling. i have a hard time getting mastering the coordination it takes to make this thing work, i can't imagine the frustration little hands must feel. my idea was to add this to our nerf gun lineup, but whoever got stuck with this would be &#34;dead&#34; in a second.further, the package boasts that the balls are soft. they are not even close to soft. they're made of a super-dense foam type material, and while i haven't had the courage to allow myself to get shot with one (sorry, i can only go so far for a review!) i did hit it against my skin to see if it maybe had any give. it didn't. yeah, so much for that nerf gun fight, this thing needs to be relegated to target practice, only.what i can say, is that if you can get the balls to shoot, they really do go far. so that's kind of a good thing, but combined with the fact the balls are specialized (and you only get two), if you loose them, you're out of luck. i guess this is good for the company that makes refills, but from a consumer standpoint, it's highly annoying.  and since the balls are incredibly hard for this type of toy, woe be unto anyone close to the shooter who managed to get a good pull.i can give zing points for trying to find a creative way to make a new slingshot, but i think the huntress zing shot reiterates that sometimes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",Negative,Negative,0.9168336

"i bought 2 zoomers. this one in the black and white for my 4 year old son and the pink one, zoomie, for my 10 year old daughter. despite reading the bad reviews, i went ahead and bought these hoping they wouldn't have any of the charging issues i have been reading about. first of all, as soon as these came out of the box, i charged each one for an hour long as the directions described. we turned them on and they are the cutest most adorable little things you've ever seen. we were really impressed by the movements of the puppies and how much they resemble a real dog. now comes the problems. the pink dog zoomie follows commands fairly well. she also runs around and doesn't bump into furniture and things because i'm assuming these dogs come with a sensor of some type that prevents them from crashing into objects. however, this black and white one does not follow commands at all. we understand we have to be patient to train him, however, the zoomie pink dog responds much better and is way far less frustrating. this dog also runs into walls, and furniture and does not seem to be responding well at all. both puppies have one common issue as well. they do not understand my kids! the directions say to push down on the puppies head and wait for the question marks to show and then you can ask a command. i have tried to do this using my own adult voice, and can sometimes get the puppies to do the tricks, however, my kids are having a much more difficult time despite having them speak loud and clear as best as they can. as far as charging goes, i have not had any issues with zoomie, but once or twice i had issues with zoomer where i had to turn him off, unplug the charger and try again. i usually can get him to charge with no problems, but we'll see how long that lasts. remember, it takes about an hour charging time and the child only gets about 20 minutes of playtime which i think is ridiculous. if your zoomer is all the way dead, you should proceed to charge, but remember his eyes may not light up at first if he doesn't have enough power to light up. if you wait a few minutes and test his eyes again, he should light up if working properly. i have never used my computer to charge either puppy. i have been using a wall outlet and so far after a few days, both my zoomers are charging. the idea in general is very cute and if these guys would work as advertised, i'm sure they would be a big hit. however, there are several issues that need to be worked out. in my opinion, if you want to buy one of these, and you don't mind the pink zoomie, go with that one as i've had a lot less issues with that puppy compared to the black and white zoomer.",Negative,Negative,0.8976843

"we fell for the hype before christmas too.  my 5 year old son wanted it so badly, finally got it, and by the end of the day on christmas we all knew, including my son, this was just a waste of a toy.here is the sole positive thing about this toy:when he's on, he is cute.  his puppy motions are very accurate, and match a &#34;real&#34; puppy in a cool way.  the kids liked watching him stick his butt up in the air, run around, and roll.that being said, after watching him move in a cute way for awhile, they wanted this dog to do what it is supposed to do:  obey commands.  and here starts the cons list:1.  charge lasts for only about 20 minutes!  you can play with the stupid thing for only 20 minutes (fully charged for an hour!) and then you have to plug it back in.  why bother?  we thought it was a toy we could kind of leave out and play with throughout the day.  no.  you play with it for a short time, then plug it back in for at least an hour.  then play again for a short time.  then plug it back in.  this is beyond frustrating.  he ends up just being always dead.2.  what is this &#34;he learns more commands the more you play with him&#34; nonsense?  he is a robot!  what does &#34;learn&#34; mean?  humans know how humans learn, but how are we to know how robots &#34;learn&#34;?  they should reveal this &#34;secret&#34; to the parents so we can at least know how to know if the kids are on the right track to getting the dog to understand them.  does zoomer need to hear a voice say &#34;play dead&#34; 10 times, 50 times, or 100 times before he'll actually do it?  is this magic &#34;learned&#34; number hard-coded somewhere in his computer, that he needs to hear something x amount of times before he can do it?  care to share that secret with the folds forking out $80+ to purchase him?  we should know how to verify whether or not he is working correctly.  and does he need to learn in one session before the battery dies, or can his learning be spread out amongst his very frequent recharges?  and how long does he retain the learned material?  a few days?  a week? a month?  and what does &#34;he's a puppy, sometimes he may not feel like following your instructions&#34; (found in the manual) mean???  is it coded in him somewhere to only follow every other command?  every 3 commands?  it would seem like any malfunction could be excused as &#34;well he's just a puppy, he's in a 'bad mood' (also in the manual) or he hasn't learned that command yet?&#34;  well i'm not buying it.  computers should be reliable, and this is a computer.  so how does it work??  we have no way to tell.  in any event, it doesn't matter, because it would seem he never learns or obeys....see #3.3.  he doesn't do anything my kids tell him.  now, siri on my iphone often doesn't understand my kids either.  kids don't always have the best pronunciation, so this is understandable.  but zoomer doesn't understand anything they say ever...and they have normal kid pronunciation.  why market a toy to children that requires perfect pronunciation to function?  no matter however, because he doesn't understand me either, even when i speak very carefully.  when he doesn't understand me, sometimes i think, &#34;we'll maybe he just hasn't 'learned' this command yet, or is in a 'bad mood' (whatever that means!), but even after saying it over and over, he still doesn't do it.  i've never gotten this dog to do a command.  at least i can't tell if he has done one, because he spends all his time rolling around and being super hyper, so i'll say something, and then try to observe whether he has performed the action in the midst of all the other rolling and spinning he is doing.  so basically he's too hyper to even know if he's doing what you ask.4.  my kids have given up and so have i.  we don't know what this &#34;learning&#34; process involves, and he doesn't even stay charged long enough to explore it in any significant way.  this toy is garbage.  and i'm mad about it because he was so expensive.  i hate this toy.",Negative,Negative,0.96000683

"oh where to start with this one.  logo party is not much of a party, it isn't much fun at all.  it is disappointing because there seems like an awfully good idea tucked in here, but generally it just fails at every turn.most problematic is the actual design of the physical game.  the game comes with a holder for the cards, unfortunately it is slightly too small for the number of cards they give you, so you are left either jamming in cards and bending them or having to leave a certain number out, cluttering your table etc.  not a huge deal but not a good first impression.the huge problem we ran into was with the timer/card revealer.  it is made of the cheapest plastic they could find and thus right out of the box it didn't work.  you are supposed to be able to pull up the timer and have it lock, allowing you to place the card in it.  it didn't lock.  there is also supposed to be a ding when the timer runs out.  there was not a ding.  this was less of a problem as the excruciatingly loud grinding noise the timer makes when going down is noticeable enough when it stops.  sadly it is also massively distracting and annoying during game play.despite the cheapness and poor design of the game, all would be forgiven if it were actually fun.it is not fun.essentially you put into one of three categories, draw it, do it or describe it.  describe it is painfully easy.  during the course of the entire game, no one missed it once.  draw it was a bit harder, but not by much.  the only one that was missed was trying to draw &#34;air china&#34; in the 20 second limit.  do it is charades and when you are doing it to something like &#34;progresso&#34; it seems really stupid.essentially no one missed a question with rare exceptions.  since you can play until you miss one, the entire game rest on &#34;reveal it&#34; spaces in which someone puts a card in the timer/revealer and slowly shows you the logo, the first person to gets it gets control of the board and moves forward.  and that is it.  no brand trivia, nothing to really shake things up.after an hour, we all just wondered why we weren't playing cranium, a better game with more variety.i was excited about this game, but it was just a miss.  it's too bad, i think there might be something here.",Negative,Negative,0.9640501

"applejack is cute, but for some reason she looks the least like her pony character out of any of the dolls of the set. it is some the eye shape and possibly the fact her freckles are darker and almost blend in with her face. she looks better in the pictures than in person.these dolls look nothing like the characters from the ""equestria girls"" movie. they look more like a product of weird mlp furry fanfic. some kids won't care about this, but many will notice it as soon as they see them and find that disappointing. their quality is a mixed bag. the faces are painted beautifully with glossy paint and glitter. i'm not a big fan of heavy makeup on dolls, but hasbro made their faces a mixture of whimsical, but tasteful and cute. the styles of clothing are adorable, too. the dresses/skirts tend to be a bit short, but they are girly enough (they are not made to look ""sexy"") it is cute.however, the quality really stops there. the clothing is a nightmare! it is cheap and poorly-made. a lot of the dolls' clothes aren't hemmed on the bottom and either look ragged--or will look ragged in a few play sessions. the seams on some of the clothes are starting to fall apart in the box. it's a shame hasbro had to be so cheap as they already got around the clothing costs by making a lot of the dolls' tops painted on the body.this wouldn't be a biggie as fashion doll clothes can be exchanged with other brands or hand-made by a talented child/parent/collector. however, any creativity on making future clothes is limited by the shoes. they are part of the feet. as a parent and toy collector, this trend really bothers me to begin with. it is really gross and creepy taking off the shoes on the footless dolls. the knobs that hold the shoes on the legs look like bones. it also sends the really negative message to girls that shoes are more important than feet. yuck!as a parent, i find this very impractical and wasteful as shoe/feet can be easily lost and you end up with a doll who forever looks like she had an accident with a machete--a lovely marketing technique to force you to buy future (cheaply-made) outfits to obtain more ""feet."" if you are a parent worried about this or have a sensitive child, it may be a good time to break out the super-glue. come on, hasbro--these girls were ponies. they need their feet. at least make them into hooves.next, the bodies on the equestria girls in the smaller packages are very cheap. the legs are stiff plastic. only the ones in the deluxe fashion sets bends at the knee (the more expensively-priced rainbow dash and fluttershy). i never understood how toy companies could make dolls like this as it seems to be a safety hazard, but it's also low-quality and not as fun to play with. a few barbies have legs like that, but they are either dolls either for tub play (so they don't mildew) or ones that are marked well into the $5-7 range--which tells me hasbro is trying to cut corners every way possible to make a buck and the equestria girls are ridiculously over-priced.finally we get to the hair. the plugs in the front are tight and close together, but the plugs past that are *very* sparse. the scalp appears to painted to hide this on applejack, but not for the other dolls. the hair is typical pony hair--and it's probably a good thing it's sparse for that reason as it will knot quickly. the hair quality is okay for the small ponies (because of the way it's lined up), but will be a total pain to brush out on a fashion doll. not at all the quality you'd see in a barbie or monster high doll.all-in-all, i don't think i'd purchase this doll if i saw it in the store--not for these prices (even the retail ones)--or i'd only buy my kid's favorite character (rainbow dash). i discourage fellow parents and toy collectors from spending any less than retail on it (if even that). this toy is maybe worth $10--at the most. barbie dolls that are similar (hard legs, painted on tops--but almost always better hair) cost even less than that. there are many other dolls that are higher-quality in the same price range or less.",Negative,Negative,0.9977996

"when i read about the magic jinn game, i thought it sounded like a great deal of fun--perhaps like a junior version of twenty questions. while i didn't expect it to be a sophisticated toy, it is really quite inexpensive looking and tiny (the difference between a christmas gift and a stocking stuffer, this comes across as more of a novelty stocking stuffer). with the assistance of three triple a batteries, your tiny blue cat is ready to challenge you. think of any animal, no matter how obscure, and the magic jinn will ask endless questions until it narrows down your guess. an adult with a wicked streak might be able to outsmart the jinn, but most small children will choose appropriate animals that the jinn can guess. so far, sounds good.i know that some might object to the cat's rather sassy attitude. i, however, didn't mind that it poked fun at our intellectual prowess. if your kids can't withstand the playful taunts of this plastic cat, i worry about their survival in the big bad world.my problem with the magic jinn is much more fundamental. it simply isn't much fun. the kids thought it was amusing once. once you've done it, though, it becomes unbearably repetitive. it asks the same questions, it utters the same phrases, oftentimes it doesn't hear your responses. it's a decent idea, it just lacks replay value. after two turns, magic jinn was left behind and there has been no interest in reviving him. might make an interesting diversion at a party (a very quiet party) where the kids only do it for a day, but not something that will be treasured or thought of very often otherwise. kgharris, 10/13.",Negative,Negative,0.9000888

"i have never been wild about board games or party games designed on an electronic game, and although this one is cute, i have to say it falls well short of the online ""draw something"". for one thing, it needs a stand - some sort of base to stand the thing upright. it is awkward to draw on it so someone can see the reverse side. but i am getting ahead of myself. designed to look like a large flat pencil with a window in its middle, the game lights up when turned on and has a timer alarm that is charming. it comes with a deck of cards as well, although they do not fit easily into the holder on the game device nor withdraw easily from that holder. you draw on the window with a stylus a picture of one of the objects named on a card you drew and others guess what you are drawing from the artwork and the random letters displayed on the back of the card. it is sort of like, dare i say, ""pictionary""? except you do it on this neat green screen with a stylus. you achieve points dependent on the difficulty of the word selected and whether or not it is guessed successfully. the texture of the drawing surface is nice to draw on and that would be enough without adding the game dimension, because the game aspect doesn't seem well thought out.the words on the cards are just a little obscure, and, although the game is touted to be for ages 8 and above, some of the words will be way past an eight-year-old. for instance, how many kids of that age know what a rolls royce looks like? or who in the heck is psy, radiohead, judge judy, jay leno, or little wayne? how many eight-year-olds watch downton abbey? as a family, it is no fun to play something that mom and dad have to explain to the kids, and for the kids, trying to draw something when you have no idea what it is can only be a source of frustration.  we tested the game on lunch hour at the office and found even adults had a hard time figuring out what to draw for many of the clues.the game is cute, the drawing surface really cool, but a bit of a disappointment otherwise. to me, the true worth of the online game is that you try to draw something your opponent can guess and win points if you are successful in drawing something your opponent recognizes and your opponent gets points for guessing correctly. its charm to me is that it is a win-win scenario with cooperation between artist and guesser. this game doesn't achieve that interesting format",Negative,Positive,0.43845293

"update (april 8, 2014): i was able to ""fix"" the broken leg by splitting open the upper leg area at the seam where it's glued. this seam wasn't very strong and may have already been split, leading to the leg falling off. from there, all i needed to do was line it up and apply a lot of pressure, and the socket in the leg slipped onto the ball on the hip. i then used model cement (tenax, a very thin, extremely toxic glue, rather than the thick, gooey testor's stuff) and clamped the leg halves firmly together for the better part of a day. by clamp i mean really clamped - using a bar-type clamp that has enough strength to squeeze the plastic halves together and cause some of the softened plastic out of the seam. since then, the doll's leg has been fine. shouldn't have to to this.original review (nov. 12, 2013): my younger daughter, 5, loved this the moment i gave it to her. within a week, the right leg had broken off, apparently bent too far which resulted in the leg separating from a ball joint at the hip. it appears to be irreparable, unfortunately. my wife points out that barbie dolls have easily replaced legs because mattel knows this is likely to happen. i've been messing with this doll for weeks now trying to get the leg back on, and the only way i can see is to split it at the seam, pop it back on, and attempt to glue it. i haven't bothered yet because i doubt even the nasty, caustic model cement i have will heal the split seam. my daughter love it, so i give the ""fun"" aspect 4 stars, but the problems force me to rate it 1 star: avoid, not worth the money or heartache when your child can't play with it anymore.another odd thing with this doll is that the boots are the ends of the legs. they are removable and swappable with other dolls, but it can't be played with minus boots like most other dolls, with just knobs at the ends of the legs. not much fun unless there's an amputee theme going during playtime. perhaps the manufacturer wants to enlighten the youth of today about sensitive issues such as this. a teachable moment, as they say.",Negative,Negative,0.975718

"twilight sparkle so far is my least favorite of the bunch. like her pony counterpart--hasbro has a very hard time matching the color of her head with her body. on a fashion doll, this is especially strange-looking and noticable---it's like she has a weird tan line. like the rest of the dolls from the non-deluxe sets, her hair is super sparse. you can see her scalp easily through her bangs. she is not worth retail price (for reasons listed below). maybe ten clams.it's worth noting these dolls look *nothing* like the characters from the ""equestria girls"" movie. they look more like a product of weird mlp furry fanfic instead. some kids won't care about this, but many will notice it as soon as they see them and find that disappointing. their quality is a mixed bag. the faces are painted beautifully with glossy paint and glitter. i'm not a big fan of heavy makeup on dolls, but hasbro made their faces are a mixture of fancy but tasteful and cute. the styles of clothing are cute, too. the dresses/skirts tend to be a bit short, but they are girly enough that it is cute.however, the quality really stops there. the actual quality of the clothing is a nightmare! it is cheap and poorly-made. a lot of the dolls' clothes aren't hemmed on the bottom. the seams on some of the clothes are starting to fall apart in the box. it's a shame hasbro had to be so cheap as they already got around the clothing costs by making a lot of the dolls' tops painted on the body.this wouldn't be a biggie as fashion doll clothes can be exchanged with other brands or hand-made by a talented child/parent/collector. however, any creativity on making future clothes is limited by the shoes. they are part of the feet. as a parent and toy collector, this trend really bothers me to begin with. it is really gross and creepy taking off the shoes on the footless dolls. it also sends the really negative messege to girls that shoes are more important than feet. yuck! as a parent, i find this very impractical and wasteful as shoe/feet can be easily lost and you end up with a doll who forever looks like an amputee--a lovely marketing technique to force you to buy future (cheaply-made) outfits to obtain more ""feet."" if you are a parent worried about this, it may be a good time to break out the super-glue. come on, hasbro--these girls were ponies. they need their feet. at least make them into hooves.the bodies on the equestria girls in the smaller packages are very cheap. the legs are stiff plastic. only the ones in the deluxe fashion sets bends at the knee (the more expensively-priced rainbow dash and fluttershy). i never understood how toy companies could make dolls like this as it seems to be a safety hazard, but it's also low-quality. they are also not as fun to play with. a few barbies have legs like that, but they are either dolls either for tub play (so they don't mildew) or ones that are marked well into the $5-7 range--which tells me hasbro is trying to cut corners every way possible to make a buck and the equestria girls are ridiculously over-priced.finally, we get to the hair. the plugs in the front of most of the dolls (except twilight sparkle) are tight and close together, but the plugs past that are *very* sparse. the hair is typical pony hair--and it's probably a good thing it's sparse for that reason as it will knot quickly. okay for ponies (because of the way it's lined up), but a pain to brush out on a fashion doll. not at all the quality you'd see in a barbie.all-in-all, i don't think i'd purchase this doll if i saw it in the store--just rainbow dash and maybe fluttershy as the deluxe style sets are a little better made. i discourage fellow parents and toy collectors from spending any less than retail on it (if even that). this toy is maybe worth ten clams--at the most. barbie dolls that are similar (hard legs, painted on tops--but almost always better hair) cost even less than that, and the monster dolls (monster high, bratzillas) are better quality and can be grabbed for that much when they are on sale.",Negative,Negative,0.9975331

"this review is written from the viewpoint of a parent and educator.presenting this box to a young child makes an impressive gift.  it&#8217;s large, colorful (of course, it&#8217;s disney!), and eager little hands can&#8217;t wait to open it.  but, be prepared&#8230;for all its packaging and size, there is surprisingly little inside the big box.  it contains:  a spiral bound activity book (basically, thin sheets to color); 12 markers of poor quality with insufficient amounts of ink in them (how frustrating!); and a messenger bag with velcro closure.the sheets in the notebook are too thin for the markers; colors will bleed through to the back side.  and if the markers were really &#8216;wet&#8217; enough, color would seep through multiple pages.  there are pages that are intended for older children, missing the mark of this younger audience.  it would have been a nice touch to add sheets of stickers and a glitter stick.the messenger bag is nicely stitched canvas.  the minnie mouse, flowers, and bird painted on its cover seem to be heat-sealed and should hold up to a child&#8217;s use.  the disney logo is 3-d.  the markers can be seen through a narrow, long opening in the bag.  slipping the back cover of the activity book into the bag is how it&#8217;s held in place.what i dislike is that the bag is open on the sides.  this prevents using it as a tote bag.  if the activity book is removed, a small, slim book could be inserted there, but not much more, rendering this a fairly useless bag for future use.prices fluctuate at amazon, so it&#8217;s not a good idea to include them in a review.  however, i wouldn&#8217;t want to mislead you, since this may not be the quality of gift you have in mind.  at its present price ($29.99) i can&#8217;t recommend it.  other than the disney licensing costs, there is absolutely nothing in this box that amounts to more than a few dollars (if that) to manufacture.if you still intend to place an order, make sure you buy a set of decent markers; the originals won&#8217;t last.  they need to fit the opening in the messenger bag&#8217;s space.  and if you are considering another activity pad or art paper, it must be thin enough to fit into the bag.  it shouldn&#8217;t exceed dimensions of 7.5&#8221; length and width.one final word:  don't.",Negative,Negative,0.7364042

"to start, this item is labeled for ages 8+.  follow that suggestion - it's too complicated to assemble for younger kids.as a super mario themed building set, it's not bad.  pieces generally assemble correctly and reasonably sturdily. there is certainly some learning value in the building process.  there is some looming anticipation of the pending super mario playtime results.but then on completion, as a play toy, it seems to disappoint. although too complicated to properly assemble for younger kids, it fails to hold attention in the older ones. and although reasonably rugged, the design and quality control result in herky-jerky crude operating mechanisms, and a constant rattle of plastic pieces bouncing off the floor (after they have fallen or been knocked off).another drawback . . . . many of the latest generation of playhouse type toys can fold up and provide a sort of carrying case for the associated action figures and sub-parts.  not this one.  it's a floor space eater -- doomed to loss of interest in a day or two and then a subsequent scattering and loss of pieces, likely to never be reassembled again.a kid's enthusiasm for the electronic super mario game does not necessarily translate into similar fun time with this toy.  it didn't for my grandsons.  i cannot really recommend this set and certainly not at the prevailing price.",Negative,Negative,0.9305015
"i get it, licensing sells.  still, with the bright colors and unconventional shape of knex pieces, this doesn't look like a  super mario ghosr house, or a typical haunted house, or any kind of building.  it looks like a crazy jungle gym.  the whole point of knex is to be creative and to use the pieces, and your imagination, to create something new.  mixing in licensed items into an arty-creative toy is already tricky, and this one isn't faithful to the base material so... what's the point?  you're doing a disservice to the license and the product.it does function as a decent playhouse or playset for 3""-ish figures, and is designed similar to the layout of a super mario 3d land level.  there are platforms that move (manually, not on their own or with any gears), there are coins to collect (ugly coins that often fall off on their own), the moving 'staircase' type platforms work fairly well for a playset, most of the assemblies are fairly tough and don't come apart unintentionally, but there are also several areas comprised of mini-knex, including a carwash type hanging curtain that a ghost toy pushes into.  the mini-knex come apart very easily, so i don't understand why they are used in an area that is pushed against.  as such, the curtain is constantly popping off.  some ghosts spin on a system of gears as you move through the playset.  the gears are stiff and unreliable.  there is a large heavy ghost that spins down a curving rod.  works great, until you go to reset it and pull the whole assembly off as there isn't anything actually attaching it to the playset (it just rests in a hole).  then there is a catapult system to launch mario onto a flagpole base, to finish the 'level'.  the flagpole assembly is pretty cool, and the flag actually rises when you nail it.  that said, its very hard to make the shot.  the catapult only launches mario 6"" or so, so the catapult must be placed right next to the flagpole case, and even then mario usually splits in half and both ends of the toy fly off in different directions.i'm recommend just buying a generic set of knex and letting your child use their own creativity to build a variety of items, instead of shoehorning this oddball license into an ugly, dysfunctional playset.pros- very nice build quality.  nothing feels like it would break, even after long-term use.- mario specific toy and ghosts are very nice quality.  could be nice collector figurines if they plug the knex specific holes.- large variety of pieces- cool theme?cons- doesn't look like a mario level or a cohesive knex environment.- many features just don't work very well- corners cut in construction makes for a semi-rickity playset.",Negative,Negative,0.9893344

"i did not like this toy in the least. it leaves a lot to be desired. it reeks of a poorly utilized license cash-in. in general i have very little positive to say about this product.the assembly difficulty is highly uneven. while the track is basically a handful of clip together pieces, the piranah plant set piece is rather challenging, even for an adult. the sticker placement is also challenging and with a strong enough adhesive you have one chance to get it all right.the car itself is simply useless. the molded top fits over the car body, so the assembly is easy. however, the front part of the body stretches out too far. this results in the car sticking on the ramp. basically, the car will not travel a complete circuit without constant help from the user. removing the plastic body and using just the car base is even worse. without the car body the car base travels too quickly and will jump the track and fly off.the piranah plant is honestly just horrible. it is difficult to assemble and barely works. the molded pastic piranah plant head is so heavy, it binds up the movement mechanism. i had to apply a lubricant to get the unit to work smoothly. worse, the green pipe doesn't affix securely to the frame. as a result, it will continually fall off while operating the piranah plant. lastly, the whole piranah plant is rather superfluous. to use it on the track means you knock mario's car off the track. a car that doesn't auto shut off. so, on the occasion mario's car makes it around the track, you knock it off and it shoots off. tracking down mario's car non-stop makes this an aggravating, high maintenance toy. also, if your not careful, mario's car will break the piranah plant in some way. it really isn't designed to be constantly hit by mario's car.overall, i would not recommend this toy. it is expensive and of dubious enjoyment. there is very little interaction to be hand. it is distinctly a single player experience. the little interaction to be had, the piranah plant, causes the car to crash and careen off the track risking damage to the car. the toy is difficult to assembly and full of tiny pieces that are easy to loose. worse, the toy simply doesn't work; the majority of the time as mario's car get stuck on the ramp. i was very disappointed with this toy.",Negative,Negative,0.99276334

"perhaps it's because i am an adult and not a child, but i found that assembling this item to be a particularly frustrating experience. when i saw that it used lego-style blocks, i assumed that construction would be reasonably sturdy; i say reasonably because i knew the entire point of this toy is to ultimately knock it over. however, in performing the assembly, i felt that the blocks didn't really fit together all that well. the pieces, as assembled, were so precariously attached that it took several attempts to get major section in place and then to hold together. complicating matters, the work area had to be kept perfectly still, lest the assembly be disturbed and fall over, causing you to have to return to re-setting the major pieces into place. to top it all off, there were several pieces missing, such to the point that while i was finally able to finish the assembly, i had to improvise at the end to get a desirable look. i didn't have the heart to actually play with the toy, since that would have functionally required disassembling it! currently, it is sitting, fully assembled, on a shelf where it cannot be disturbed. i have considered permanently gluing the thing together, but then that defeats the purpose. while it was certainly a good looking set, the time of initial assembly, coupled with the precariousness of the set-up (to the point that it might fall over on it's own before you start playing with it), lead me to believe that there are better, more entertaining angry birds spin-off products out there. i certainly will not be purchasing other k'nex versions of angry birds toys.",Negative,Negative,0.99541974

"now i bought this for my three year old son with the hope that i would move him away from using my phone and focus on something that is educational.( background note, my son has been using the computer since he was 1 1/2 years so he knows his way around technology.)unboxing the device it does look nice . the design is intriguing, it feels good in your hands and does look sturdy. from my take that's all i like. i registered the device and started using it with my son. this is where the disappointment starts.-the resolution is poor. it takes very long to load ,so this irritates my son.-the camera is poor,in his words ""horrible.""-the painting app that it comes pre-loaded with also has a delay so after you write or scribble about a second after you would see your design. i find this just unacceptable. for one thing when my son wrote, he kept on doing it over and over because he thought it wasn't working.he really wants to like it but every time he starts using it, he gets frustrated.next important point the applications are very expensive. you can pay as much as $20 for an app. now some will say you cant put a price on a child's education but leapfrog you did. i spent $35 yesterday on 3 apps and those were just books.also, if you think the resolution is bad initially , it gets worse when you start reading the books.the biggest thing is the price , you pay a hefty fee of about $150 for this thing , the same price you would pay for a 7"" samsung tab 3 or kindle hdx and these pack features that are far advanced. the leapfrog comes no way close to any of these tablets for that ridiculous price and the sad part is that you easily can spend up to an additional $100 just to get the essential apps for you kids.the only thing that is going for this right now in my mind is the fact that kids love the idea that this belongs to them, was made for them.i might be the only one complaining now but remember this generation of kids knows about  8 megapixel cameras and blueray movies. so at some point they would get tired of this.i hope you take  some of my points into consideration because they are valid.",Negative,Negative,0.98464

"our experience so far:5/1/14: written to their customer support:my mother spend an insane amount of money buying my children the leappad ultra in order to help my 4 year old catch up to a pre k level (he has terrible eyesight that was recently diagnosed and glasses purchased, but not being able to see has put him behind) and to help my 6 year old with his first grade skills.while setting it up for me, she was going to purchase 5 apps to get them started. the first problem was that your system rejected her credit card the entire ""buy within 2 hours to receive 30% off"" period.i called. they said she had a different name from mine and she needed to call to add her information to the billing information. she called and did this, i was to receive an email within an hour confirming this had been done. 3 hours later, i had no email but attempted to purchase the apps through the leappad as instructed.there was no billing information on the account. it rejected my credit card. i called again. they claimed all the errors were due to the cvv number being wrong. neither of us have ever had a problem with this on any other online purchases, anywhere. they told me to try again, as i finally received that first email confirming the billing changes were made.again, the leapfrog account showed no billing information in it's records. i tried putting my mother's credit card and mine into the account information and directly into the checkout page. again nothing but errors.called again and was rudely told it was on our end and asked had we checked the bank. again we told them we had never had trouble with our cvv numbers.the rep offered to send a report ""to determine if the error was on our end or theirs"". he told me it would be monday before we heard back from them. keep in mind the 30% offer is only good the first day of registration. keep in mind i have a 4 year old and a 6 year old that will be super excited to have their own tablet but nothing (other than 3 simple apps) to do with it until monday. i have to deal with their disappointment.the rep was kind enough to supposedly add a note so that we will eventually get our 30% off, only after i insisted.my mother called back. there were no supervisors available (naturally). the most she could get out of their indifference was to put a rush on the request. supposedly we will hear from them this evening instead of monday. considering how long the 1 hour email took, i am not holding my breath.we have already decided that if this situation is not corrected quickly, we will return your product and proceed to spread the word to all of our friend and social networks. it seems ridiculous that your company would disappoint children and cause this much trouble just to receive money.5/2/14 : so far they tell me they are 'looking into why my mother's card won't work' and gave me a 20% off coupon for future purchases... not sure how to use it since i can freaking make a first purchase... also no mention on why my card won't work on their system. no mention on customer service's indifference to our problem.5/3/14 : no word. the 30% off offer is no longer showing on our cart. my cc is still not being accepted. my children still don't have the apps they were promised to play and learn with. i am so upset with leap frog.5/6/14: another email from them. they claim that my mother's information has been updated in the billing system. the stupid thing still won't accept either of our cards to pay with and the 30% off deal is expired. i am thinking that both of the introductory deals are scams at this point. buy apps within the first 2 hour (or day) and get 30% off!!!! ha ha, you can't make a purchase.",Negative,Negative,0.90659744

"to start with, let me say we are a family that owns three tag readers, two tag juniors, one each of leapster, leapster 2 and leapster explorer, and at one point we also bought a leappad but hated it so much that we returned it after one day.i received this new leapreader, which is an update to the tag reader, for review. in the package i also received two leapreader books,leapfrog leapreader book: leap and the lost dinosaur (works with tag)andleapfrog leapreader book: learn to write numbers with mr. pencil.a quick overview: the leapreader adds new functionalities to the tag reader, including stand-alone audiobooks and music player. it also comes with a built-in rechargeable battery as opposed to alkalines in the tag reader.  in case you have never seen a tag reader before, the leapreader uses an optical recognition system that picks up information on specially printed paper (basically paper with tiny little dotted patterns that tell the leapreader which book, which page and which ""hot spot"" the tip is scanning, and the on-board little computer can then play the respective content.)the out-of-package experience has been overwhelmingly negative. the reviewer's sheet claims that the two included books in the review kit had been pre-installed. not true. to my unpleasant surprise, only the dinosaur book was playable out of the box. the mr. pencil book was not installed, and, worse, the sample book that's included in every retail package was also not installed!anyone who's ever used a leapfrog ""smart"" educational toy before knows how bad their leapfrog connect program is. this is the program that you must install on a pc in order to download audio content to the leapreader (much as with the older tag and tag junior). when i read on the packaging that i must use the leapfrog connect program again, my heart skipped a beat and my blood pressure went up.  i really hated that program.  (don't ask me why we kept buying leapfrog products...)i'm happy to report that the updated leapfrog connect program is as buggy as ever.  first of all, like any half-smart computer user, i use a standard user account 100% of the time (so to shield my system from potential viral attacks).  if you have an older version of leapfrog connect installed on your computer,  you must log into the administrator account in order to update it!  seriously, leapfrog.  any decent windows program would update under the user account control, without the user's having to log into the admin account separately.  so now i had to log into my admin account, which i had never had to do once since getting this lenovo laptop over a year ago.  that was annoying.  responding to the uac with your admin password is a 5-second process; logging into the admin account takes more time because now all your account settings and start-up apps must load.  just plain annoying.okay, so i did that.  the connect program updated itself without much of a problem, although the updater interface is ridiculously crude: it just says ""wait until download is complete, then click ok"". no progress bar, no estimated time remaining.  it's 2013 and leapfrog's software guys write crap like this???then i connected the new leapreader to the updated leapfrog connect program via usb -- funny that my reviewer's sheet warns against the reviewr connecting the leapreader to the computer at all, or the ""included"" contents would be erased.  whoever works in leapfrog marketing should...  ok, whatever.indeed, connecting my shiny new leapreader to leapfrog connect deleted the dinosaur book's audio content. once i logged into my leapfrog account, i was given a couple of free audio samples, including, finally, the sample file for the included sample book.  scratching my head in disbelief... who the heck came up with this great product??according to leapfrog connect, the leapreader has a meager 201 mb of memory.  the sample book's audio file is 9mb. the dinosaur book's audio file (which i later downloaded) is 8mb.  the mr. pencil book is 11mb.  let's say the average book's audio file is 10mb in size. that comes to up to 20 books you can store on the leapreader.  its 2013 and leapfrog's hardware guys make crap like this???  that's at most 20 books without any other content!actually i got ahead of myself a little.  when i was trying to download the dinosaur and mr. pencil books' contents, i ran into problems with the lovely leapfrog connect program.  just as it happened before, this updated version (albeit looking better than before) kept trying to download or sync, or both, the audio file(s) to the leapreader.  i was disconcerted by the countless disconnect/connect happenings that were taking place between the leapreader and the leapfrog connect program.  i thought the infamous bug, whereby leapfrog connect was never able to download any content to your expensive toy, was going to bite again.  out of experience, i decided to leave the syncing alone and went to get lunch for my kids.  when i came back, the books synced.  later, i synced the u.s. map audio file and that appears to have synced fine.  (i haven't been able to check the map audio since my kids appear to have misplaced the tag map!)now, if you have a tag, you may be wondering whether the leapreader is compatible with tag books.  judging from the ""companion audio"" download screen, it seems that only some tag books are compatible with the leapreader. for example, ourleapfrog tag activity storybook kung fu panda: po's tasty trainingis not on the list, therefore we'll not be able to re-enjoy that small book with the leapreader.  only a few tag books like i spy imagine that! and spy wars the clone wars are on the downloadable companion audio list.  this sucks, period.  we have a dozen tag books that we bought.  i thought at least my baby is now old enough to read them, but with the three tag readers misplaced (with one probably conveniently ""borrowed"" without permission by one of the neighborhood boys who's known to take to, at the ripe age of 8, borrowing other people's toys without asking and displaying them in his bedroom), we now cannot rely on leapreader to read these books. just sucks, like i said.in summary, i'm once again disappointed by a leapfrog product.  all they have to do is invest a few dollars and get a working syncing program before releasing these hardware products.  better yet, they should make these things wireless capable, so that all us parents have to do is download content on the fly, without having to find the pc to connect to.  seriously, there're so many ways to improve this product.  sadly, the same was said by me and others 3 or 4 years ago when we first bought into leapfrog's ""non-smart"" educational toys.",Negative,Negative,0.9964224

"the k'nex star shooter coaster set was a huge disappointment.  the directions were merely okay, but at times it was unclear which piece needed to be used.  assembling the roller coaster was further hampered because the pieces were so small and flimsy.  k'nex are usually much thicker and sturdier.  the track was beyond frustrating to assemble.  the directions indicate curves in the track that are not possible to maintain at the various stages of construction.  once i finally did get the whole toy assembled, it did not work!  the curves in the track caused the chain to get stuck.  the chain itself was junk.  the chain is assembled from tiny little plastic links that interlock.  the chain would get stuck on itself, even before it was connected to the roller coaster.  the tiny, plastic chain links just had too much friction to be practical.i consulted the limited troubleshooting section for the toy.  the first item or symptom was, ""the toy does not work"".  their response/solution was, ""is the toy assembled correctly?"", which is an interesting question.  if the directions had actually been decent, i may have actually been able to use them as a reliable reference material to confirm whether or not the toy was built correctly.  however, if the directions were clear in the first place, then maybe the toy would work.we three adults looked over the toy and the directions and we found no faults that we could discern.  this toy is poorly designed and needs further development.  i wish k'nex had put more thought into the roller coaster's design, because had they done so, this toy would have been a lot fun.  as it is, it's sure to disappoint a child.",Negative,Negative,0.9988237

"the idea of this game is neat.  take classic twister and infuse it with the ever popular (is it still popular?) dance dance revolution and you have twister dance rave.  cool, right?  not really.  sadly, nothing outside of a simple idea was thought through here.  at the end of the day, there is a product that produces short term glee from some little kids and absolutely nothing from anyone over the age of six.  the conception of the game was fine, but the execution is a mess.and here is why.first, the unit itself only plays four programed songs.  these songs are fun, but gameplay can get very monotonous after a while with only four songs to choose from.  now, there is an option to plug in your own music device (ipod or iphone) and select any song from your music list.  this sounds, in concept, like a great idea.  the problem is that there are no programed dances to this random music and so you get random lights.  in other words, your dancing won't mesh with the flow of the song and so it becomes somewhat ridiculous to even bother.another issue is the round plastic colored circles you are supposed to step on.  they are so flimsy that mid-song they are moving all over the floor, which makes gameplay near impossible.  my kids were yelling for me to pause the song so they could fix their circles.the most excitement they got from this was when the purple light came on and they could dance around anyway that they wanted to.if you want to use this as a kid's stereo (since you can play music through it) then whatever, but even at that, it isn't anything great.  these speakers don't produce the best sound.  it's clear, no distortion or anything, but these aren't `speakers' and so you'll get nothing special.  as a game, this is kind of a mess.  it just doesn't work.  i like that it got my kids active for ten minutes, but they can have more fun dancing in their rooms to the radio.",Negative,Negative,0.97030044

"these leappad products are definitely kid proof. this model has replaceable and rechargeable batteries which is nice. the ultra version batteries are not user replaceable which is a big downside of that model. battery life is good, i'd guess about 10 hours or so. our son uses them on long car trips without them losing power.we have two leap pads. one is this leappad2 model and the other is the ultra (free to us as vine members). as far as the product itself they are fine and the biggest advantage of them is they are very sturdy and kid proof. our 4-year-old son has put them both through the test, hitting the screen very hard with the stylus, getting the screen wet and putting his food covered fingers on the screen. they clean up and perform perfectly.the apps are mostly pretty good, one big advantage is they are voice directed so if the little on can't read they still can use the apps. i must say our 4-year-old learned the alphabet by himself with the leappad in about a week.the really big downside, and the one that makes me mark it two stars, is the apps are way too expensive. some can be had for about $5 but they are far from the best apps. many of them are $25. yes you can often find sales but that takes 10-20% off the price reducing the $25 apps down to perhaps $20 - still very expensive.in an era when you can buy a 7&#34; tablet (not kid proof) for under $100 and load it up with good apps which are anywhere from free to $5 i just can't see spending the outrageous prices for the leap apps. i'm guessing it is a matter of volume. if leapfrog sold in huge volume like tablet apps do then the prices might come down.purchase a dozen apps for the leappad and you've likely spent upwards of $200.we have purchased a few apps for the leappad but tend to buy way less expensive apps for our smartphones and let our son play with them. the leappad is used less and less now. we will likely buy our son a 7&#34; tablet next.",Negative,Negative,0.9508295
"my five-year-old daughter has been wanting a leap pad for about six months now since she played her cousin's, so i was happy to get the opportunity to try this one.  boy am i glad we didn't spend money on it.the good points of this device begin and end with the ease of set up.  out of the box, the leap pad will be ready to use in about ten minutes of hooking up to the internet and downloading from the leap frog website.when my daughter first got the leap pad, she dove right into it and played most of the rest of the day, pausing only when we insisted that she give her older sister a turn to satisfy her curiosity.  i was relieved that finally she won't be pestering me for my smartphone all the time.after playing with it again the next day for less than an hour, however, my daughter asked me for my phone again.  by the end of the week she had practically forgotten about the leap pad and was right back with the phone.  while giving in and letting her borrow my phone, i decided to see what this leap pad is all about.  didn't take me more than 5 minutes to want my phone back.the package includes nine apps when you initially connect to the leap frog website.  among these are a decent art program, a pet corner and a game that ""teaches"" the flags and various random useless facts about countries the majority of adults have never heard of.  there is also a calculator, a clock and a couple other apps your average preschooler will never touch.  to the extent she has used it at all since the initial days, my daughter only uses the pet and art apps.the package also includes a $20 download card in order to load more programs from the leap frog website.  at first i was pretty impressed.  the apps range from $5 and up and you get a discount the more apps you buy.  the apps include games, videos, ebooks and other sorts of ""educational"" material.  i was able to get five apps, so i was pretty happy.  at first the new apps didn't download to the device properly and my daughter couldn't find them, but my husband hooked the device back up to the internet and the problem resolved itself.the problem is, the apps are junk.  the games are very simplistic and repetitive.  among the games we got, there were two themes.  three of the games involved inserting missing pieces to create a complete tube or waterslide to get from one end of a path to the other.  two of the games involved patterns of moving objects out of the way to ""free"" something (a polar bear, for instance).  the one ebook we got was insulting, even for a preschooler's cognitive level and my daughter didn't want to touch it again.i'm sure our mistake was choosing the cheaper alternatives.  i'm guessing that the apps that cost $20 and up may hold your child's attention better.  but who wants to spend that kind of money on a child's toy that already costs nearly $100?  it's just a continual black hole sucking money straight out of your wallet.  you can also choose cartridges which can at least be shared among friends, but they are also expensive and are probably easily lost.once you set up the device and register your child(ren), leap frog will send you periodic updates regarding your child's ""progress"".  this is to give further credibility to leap pad as an ""educational learning tool"".  the fact is, however, there is little that is educational about this or any other electronic gadget.  memorizing facts is not ""learning"".  age appropriate learning for a preschooler involves hands-on exploration and discovery, pretend play, engagement with parents and other adults, as well as interaction with peers.  none of that is offered - and, in fact, is stilted - by isolated, controlled ""play"" on a gadget.in any case, in this modern world, electronic gadgets may be nearly unavoidable.  if you really think your youngster needs a gadget, a simple small tablet would probably be a better option.  there are plenty of free games and other apps for tablets.  it may not look as inviting and ""child-friendly"" as this device with its two extra styluses and doc mcstuffins wallpaper, but it's a much better deal in the long run.update 3/13/14:  two other things i forgot to mention.  first, the leap pad is equipped with a camera, but it takes such bad pictures, your child will probably not want to use this feature more than once.  second, on the pet app, your child can wash his/her pet which involves, among other things, blowing into part of the device to dry off the pet, which the kids think is fun, but i find a bit bizarre.  i don't know whether the germ factor bothers me more (especially since it's designed to be shared among up to three kids) or the fact that it's eerily like a breathalyzer.",Negative,Negative,0.9808483

"dora fans will love this toy because it is cute.  dora's hair is rooted, but that is the only part of this doll that has any real play value.  the monkey, boots, is what makes this the cutest, but he is a hanger on.  he doesn't do anything on his own.  he can clasp dora's hand or attach his skates to the front or back of dora's skates to pull him along while dora zooms around the room.there are three settings on dora, stop, dance, and free play.  in free play, dora talks and the music plays but she doesn't move. that's where the child can play with dora by pushing her around on her wheels.on the dance setting, dora shouts, music plays then she spins around before shooting off across the room.  boots plays better when he's attached to dora's skates than when he is holding her hand because the jerky motion of dora when she takes off sends boots whipping away and they both stop.  when dora hits an object she stops moving, but the very, very loud music keeps playing.  if you turn her away from the object she does not take off again until the music stops and you push the button on her shoe to start all over again.i can see this toy being fun for a day, then there's just not much to it.  the fun part is watching them move on their own, so i can't see the free play part getting much action.dora comes with four aa batteries locked inside one shoe.  you'll need a screwdriver to open the battery case, but the screws are secured to the lid so they won't fall out and get lost, or swallowed.  she stops when picked up so the batteries won't wear down if left on.this is not a toy you want around on a saturday morning when you're trying to sleep in.  or, the afternoon when you're tired of all the noise, or whatever.  or, any time i can possibly think of because it is loud!",Negative,Negative,0.9701347

"i received this game to review for amazon, and my 8 year old grandson just happened to be visiting when it arrived. his eyes absolutely lit up when he saw it. ""i saw the ad for this on tv!,"" he said. ""this is going to be fun!"" so with much anticipation we got out all the pieces and instructions and started to put it together.first, the pieces are difficult to put together for an 8 year old, but with (grand)parental assistance it went fine. however, when we got to blowing up the balloon, the instructions told us we needed a balloon pump, which was not included! how many people have a balloon pump laying around?! with some difficulty (taking the game apart, blowing up the balloon, and re-assembling), we got the balloon blown up and everything together.the object of the game is to roll the dice, and ""poke"" the balloon with one of the secured sticks as many times as the dice rolls. great in theory, terrible in practice. of the 9 sticks, 5 of them did not ""click"" as they should to count off your turns. we would push a stick in twice, and it would not click, but pop right back out. that makes 5 out of 9 of the sticks totally worthless.the first balloon we blew up may have been blown up too large, as two ""pokes"" and it popped. not much fun in that.the second balloon we blew up (and by the way, we had to once again dis-assemble the entire game, insert the balloon, blow it up, and re-assemble), we blew up smaller and with the sticks that did work, none of them popped the balloon because it wasn't blown up enough.as we did try to poke the balloon with sticks, the top piece that holds the basic game together kept popping off, and we would have to stop, push it back into place, and try again.after two balloons, my grandson gave up and didn't want to play anymore. we went from bright eyed with anticipation to a little bottom lip sticking out in disappointment. i am certainly glad this wasn't a birthday or christmas gift for him (and it may well have been on his 'wish list' from seeing the tv ad!)i don't give bad reviews lightly, but i have to be honest with this one because i hate to think of disappointed kids on christmas morning. overall, a frustrating, badly produced waste of time and money. move along. there's nothing to see here.",Negative,Negative,0.99679345

"this is a really weak offering from lego. what happened is this: they released a far superior version of jabba's sail barge back in 2006 (lego number 6210) and it became a very popular set after it was retired. so, naturally they wanted to re-release the set in some form. instead of improving the set, however, such as what lego did with sets like jabba's palace 4480 (which became the much better 9516), lego decided to release a vaguely similar (yet worse) set in order to shamelessly capitalize on pent-up demand for a sail barge set. the result is the set you see before you. it is less faithful to the design of the sail barge in the 1983 film than the 2006 set, and the minifigure selection and piece count are fairly weak for a $120 set as well. in short, i highly recommend that you pick up a nice used set (or new if you don't mind paying a lot extra) of the 6210 version. they are selling for only a little more than this set on the used market and they are a much better design. don't even get me started on the fact that this set lacks a sarlacc pit; what a wasted opportunity. this is an overpriced and underwhelming set and i recommend avoiding it.",Negative,Negative,0.88919896

"i wish i hadn't bought this behemoth at this point.  the voice recoginition is a joke.  i use fluency to dictate at work and microsoft's voice recognition is so inferior it is laughable.  one of the few games i have, dead rising 3, was constantly crashing when i played it.  after searching forums/blogs, i found out that it probably was because i played the game while it was still loading (which by the way took forever).  so i had to delete the game, lost my save data, and then install the game, install the update for the game (also huge) and then i could play it without crashing.  plus, my biggest annoyance is that i thought that the xbox one was supposed to be better about not having you watching downloading and installing bars cross the screen.  now granted i don't play it a lot.  i'm a busy physician and there aren't good games.  but everytime i turn the thing on it makes me download some enormous update and then install it.  or when you put a new game in you have to wait for it to load (obviously all the way based on my dead rising experience).  when you only have an hour to play before bed after you get the kids down and you spend half of it doing these updates or loading a game, it's pretty disappointing.  also, the thing is just glitchy.  i've had issues with the controller and the unit having communication issues with each other which never happened with my 360 and you can tell the controller has thinner, flimsier plastic than the 360 controllers which would be fine if it were cheaper. plus i no longer run my directv through the xbox one which was supposed to be some wonderful function because it has a much less user friendly menu when you do this, it made our dvr mess up where it would take 2 or 3 seconds before it would fast forward with the 30 second skip and when you hit that button 6 times during a commercial break it's pretty annoying to have 12 or 15 seconds of just wasted time, and worst of all it clearly made our picture worse on our tv.  i took the hdmi cable and plugged it straight into the tv from the dvr and then through the xbox one into the tv and there was clearly a less crisp, duller, washed out picture.  it wasn't even tough to see the difference.  my wife clearly noticed it and that isn't something she even claims to care about.  and now microsoft slaps me in the face and the kinect that i just had to have as an initial buyer because it was ""so integral to the xbox one and it's future"" is not not necessary at all and in fact i got to pay $100 for the privelege of having something that was even slowing my gpu down by 10% potentially making the graphics worse according to an article i just read.  all i can say is next time microsoft makes a console, i will absolutely not make the mistake of being an early adopter.  lesson learned.  wow, i sound so angry.  believe me, you don't spend $500 and not want to like something but ms just failed on a lot of levels to deliver here.",Negative,Negative,0.99713147
"lets cut to the chasecons:1.) its $100 more than the competing console (ps4)2.) the feature that is to warrant the $100 (kinect) barely works. ign actually voted the ps eye for ps4 to work better. i can't say if it does or not, but i can tell you that the kinect is not good.a.) voice commands only work if it is completely silent. a game or movie can't be playing very loud or else it doesn't work.b.) when it is silent, commands work around 65% of the time. its embarrassing to use in front of company. waking it up is always at least two attempts. i don't speak with an accent.c.) using your hand to guide yourself is even worse. with excellent light, it will find you decently if you are less than 8 feet away from the sensor. to select something you need to hold your hand on what you're pressing and then push forward. no matter how many times i try, it always pushes outward from what i'm pressing towards instead of pushing it like its a button.d.) almost every game poorly implements all of the features. from some combination of fault, you never get what you want and you're always repeating yourself. if the kinect manages to sign you in by your face, it doesn't really matter, because every game i have asks me who i am when i start it up even though i just signed it with my face 10 seconds prior.3.) the graphics are without a doubt inferior to the competition. mostly its negligible for those with less than 60"" screens, but the ps4 is $100 cheaper and the stronger of the two. again, the kinect does not warrant an extra $1004.) ps4 is already offering free games every month for ps plus subscription. xbone has released a demo for killer instinct (which is insanely boring and a pretty undisputed flop)these 4 points are huge reasons not to purchase the xbox one over the ps4. there is literally no advantage that i can think of. the graphics will always lag because some of the power is allocated to the kinect at all times, and not to mention, the ps4 already has superior hardware. thats a bad combo. they could one day match the ps4's price, but i don't see it happening. number 2 was advertised to work much better. i watched a demo where they recorded audio from a room and you couldn't decipher a single thing. then it played back kinects isolated audio of the gamer and it was perfectly understandable. this has not been my case. maybe they will update it.  3 will always remain. it just doesn't have the horsepower ps4 has. as for 4, they claim they will start offering free games. hasn't happened as of yet.also,hbogo doesn't exist like it does for 360there are rampant problems with comcast internet that doesn't exist on other consoles (streaming video is sketchy as well as multiplayer)pros:1.) if this has the games you want, this is your console. for me it does, so i bought it.2.) set top box functionality is nice.3.) if they can get the kinect voice functions to work 90% of the time, it will be completely worth the $500 asking price. i have hope.i'll update this if there are changes made, but i can't find them in any of the future builds that i've scoured the internet for.2 stars because it might have the games you want and youll just have to deal with it costing more than the ps4 for no reason as of yet. this is going to make some xbox fans really unhappy, but try to think. if you don't voice your opinions about these little problems, nothing gets fixed. there is no incentive for the manufacturer. use your heads",Negative,Negative,0.97648776

"i'll update this review as my experience improves - the rating is accurate for the manufacturers handling of the product.  before the fanboi's eschew the 2 star rating... please know that i'm a huge microsoft proponent, but the rating reflects the support of issues surrounding the product.  as time progresses, i'll update to add more detail and perhaps modify my rating.i'm one of those lucky ones that did get a defective xbox one. the kinect was doa and the actual console would shutdown any time any app or game was loaded... much joy.  i signed up for the advanced exchange replacement on sunday... authorizing my cc for five hundred and change to cover the swing incase i do not return the defective xbox as the program states.the problem with the ae program is.. while i received an immediate confirmation that my card was authorized and that i'd get a follow up email after my replacement shipped... i've not heard or seen anything from microsoft for 5 business days.looking at the online myservice-dot-xbox-dot-com order status just shows &#34;order in progress&#34;... no confirmation of shipping or tracking information. i've called and chatted daily with microsoft support and none have been able to give me any status except &#34;open&#34;. they've breached their 2 day shipping sla without notice and without any commitment to when i will have an accurate status of my exchange. i can formally escalate on monday as to the terrible support through their escalation processes and i have a callback scheduled to do so.so the real issue is ... microsoft has a five hundred dollar authorization on my cc while they blow their shipping sla's without any new commitment, i cannot spend the money they have locked up in authorization.beyond that, its terrible customer service to take a customer that received a day one preorder doa and then make additional commitments to resolving the issue without follow-up or any ability of the customer to get a real status of the situation. i've burned at least 10 hours waiting in call or chat queues to find out what is going on with my order.. to fail completely in getting any useful status. microsoft is compounding a defect issue with real customer support issues - making something that wasn't good, terrible.",Negative,Negative,0.98621887
"ironically, as i was writing my review my pc had to turn back on to install windows 8.1 update which supposedly fixes a lot that is wrong with win 8.  the update keep saying almost there, yet it took over an hour for an update.despite my trials and tribulations with microsoft i decided to get the one only because it was supposed to be better for kids, and i have a young son.  so i thought it would be a perfect match, especially with the kinect to show movement and follow voice commands.the system arrived and right after setup the system froze, then froze again.  i downloaded the free, trial edition of the sports game, but sure enough that didn't work because it said the kinect couldn't get a clear view of my room.  seriously? a $500 video game system that couldn't see my room &#34;properly&#34; despite being placed in the exact recommended spot and a large, open room.  it wouldn't even attempt to play the game...just gave me an error every time.as far as the great entertainment available, it's only available if you fork over about $100 to microsoft for a gold account, every year.  and honestly what you get after shelling out that much money to ms isn't much: skype, which is free elsewhere, hbo go, also free elsewhere, some short kinect exercise games, and ms movies and music, not nearly as good as itunes or amazon.  the tv guide/ control isn't that great either--can't control your dvr, and the best case scenario, you can watch tv on a half screen and play a game on the other half.  although if you want to do that doesn't it defeat the purpose of the game.then, lets get to the kinect, the other big &#34;selling feature&#34; of the one.  the voice control was pretty decent but more of a gimmick than anything else.  i was losing my voice by the end of the night from all the yelling at kinect.  just about everything you can via voice you can do simpler and faster by pressing a button.  the gestures recognition was a joke.  over half the time it didn't even recognize my hands.  it was an exercise in frustration and i cannot believe a major company would put out a product as glitchy and faulty as the gesture recognition is--it is a joke!now, the motion recognition could be something great, kind of like the wii; however there are almost no games that take advantage of it.  in fact, there are very few games to begin with for the one.  and all my thoughts of this being a great game system for kids were squashed when i realized there are no games right now dedicated for young kids, and the kinect is really a gimmicky joke.unless you want to fork over $100 every year to microsoft for &#34;apps&#34; which are free elsewhere, you can forget about this being an all in one entertainment system.  then you realize the kinect is a joke, you are down to a game system which frankly loses to the ps 4 in nearly every category.  i cannot comment further on ps 4 because i haven't used it yet, but i do know the xbox one is like most things from microsoft: big, bloated, intrusive and overpriced!  yes many people are concerned with the kinect that microsoft can monitor you and with many tech companies more than happy to fork over your records to the nsa, it is concerning to have a company which can essentially spy on you at any time.realize that many people pay extra to get an apple computer just to not have to deal with microsoft or windows.  windows phones are a joke and will soon fall out of the marketplace, and i'm afraid the xbox is just another over-complicated product from microsoft which isn't really about fun but more about microsoft milking you for all it can.  what ms was trying to do before the xbox one was even released was disturbing--thanks to the tremendous backlash they finally gave up on their devious plans.  the one had a lot of potential but sadly ms was more focused on rushing out a glitchy, gimmicky product that it could use to try to sack consumers in as many ways possible!  so in the end the one ended up being a real zero with me and i returned it!",Negative,Negative,0.98342586

"i don't understand the point of making this version. it's cheaper by design . . . just skip it.- smaller than the others, more on par with the leappad2 in overall size.- screen is smaller than any other tablet (leappad and innotab), it's only 4.3"" instead of 5"".- no wifi- uses a microsd memory card expansion. at least they fixed the push-eject feature, and now the memory card is easier to remove.- directional touch-pad... okay, that's a good touch.- finger swiping is a bit delayed--the child really needs to press.- booting up is about as fast as the innotab 2s, glad that wasn't a let down.- camera is at 2mp, an upgrade from 1.3mp from the innotab 2s.overall, the innotab 3 feels like vtech had some techs they needed to keep employed, ""hey, go work on this project, while the other (read: more important) group works on designing the innotab 3s"" (the competition for theleapfrog leappad ultra learning tablet, green). okay, i know that's not how it went down... but save your money. aleapfrog leappad2 explorer, greenis currently $79, and i feel that's better money spent. vtech tablets always feels like cheap toys to me, instead of quality hardware worth investing in.not to knock vtech entirely, because aside from the feel of their product, thevtech innotab 2s wi-fi learning app tablet- bluecame close to giving us a good tablet, and that's currently $69.i'd skip this product and look into some of the other choices.",Negative,Negative,0.9695507

"we bought our daughter her first innotab the christmas that they were first released and it was her favorite gift. from the start, i was never a big fan of the touch screen since it was nowhere near as responsive as even a cheap smartphone touch screen, but my daughter was happy with it, and it kept her busy for hours. biggest complaint for me was that it ate batteries, and the only other option was to tie her down with a power cord.her camera broke shortly before the following christmas, and the updated innotab offered its own camera so we bought her and her two-year old sister each their own innotab 2. the innotab 2 was a mild improvement over the previous version, with a camera, microphone, and a few new apps. turning the tablet on, the innotab 1 would load to the user menu in 16 second, while the innotab 2 took 26 seconds. overall, it seemed a bit more sluggish, but it had a camera...now, the innotab 3 if finally here, and i was actually looking forward to what they'd offer this time, hoping for a bit more of an improvement over the innotab 2. no such luck, as the specs on paper were not impressive. 5"" screen was reduced to 4.3"", slightly improved camera, and a control pad.overall design: the innotab 3 is, like the previous innotabs, very well built... solid, and looks like it could take a few drops without issue. the new innotab is smaller overall then the previous innotabs, however even when my youngest daughter was 2 years old she had was able to handle the larger innotabs just fine. not sure if the smaller design is a positive or negative change. the first two innotabs sported large corner bumpers made of rubber-coated plastic... the innotab 3, due to its reduced size, no longer has the large bumpers and instead have a sliver of rubber on each corner. it remains to be seen if these reduced bumpers will greatly reduce the ability to absorb fall damage.the buttons were also redesigned. they use to have three large buttons for on/off, home, and taking a picture, along with five smaller buttons that were flush with the case and easy to press... screen brighter, screen darker, volume up, volume down, and help. the innotab 3 has only five small buttons for on/off, volume up, volume down, help, and home. they replaced the camera button with an on-screen button that doesn't work anywhere near as well... we've found we had to press the on-screen button several times before it would take a picture. never had that problem with the innotab 2's dedicated button. they also dropped the screen brightness buttons, however i don't think my kids ever used them. in addition, the new smaller buttons are concave and aren't as easy to press. my daughter specifically said she didn't like the new buttons, and although the innotab is not designed for adults, my wife and i hated them.one new addition is the 4-way control pad. i didn't like it because it feels a bit sloppy. my daughter never used it... not sure if it'll be more useful in future games.screen: by far the biggest change from the innotab 2 is the reduction of screen size... when everything is getting bigger and bigger screens, vtech decided to go in the opposite direction, reducing their screen size from 5"" to 4.3"". (leapfrog increased the size of their leappad screens from 5"" to 7"" this year.) the screen looks a bit sharper, but my wife and i were very disappointed with the reduced screen size. in addition, the video playback seems a bit unnatural. side by side, the innotab 2 screen looks smooth, but the innotab 3 looks a bit jumpy, like it has a lower refresh rate. not sure how many other people would notice it though.another major problem with the new screen is the reduced viewing angle. with the innotab 2, the screen looks good straight on, but loses a bit of detail and contrast as you turn it. viewing from a 45-degree angle at any direction, you can still clearly see the screen. the innotab 3 looks good when viewed straight on, but darkens as you increase the angle of view. at 45-degrees, it's almost too dark to see.after giving the innotab 3 to my daughter, she was not happy with the screen size at all. along with the buttons she didn't like too much, she opted to go back to her innotab 2 after about an hour of playing with it.overall, the screen is nowhere near as good as the innotab 1 and 2. i have no idea what vtech was thinking when they made this change, but it was a really bad idea, in our opinions.camera: despite the 'upgrade' to a 2.0mp camera on the innotab 3 from a 1.3mp camera in the innotab 2, the camera is clearly worse. my wife and i both took pictures with both the innotab 2 and innotab 3. after sorting through the pictures, every single picture on the innotab 3 was much darker, being able to see much less detail, even after transferring them to a pc. taking a picture of our black dog on the innotab 2, you can see a few features on her... on the innotab 3, she looked like a black blob on a dark background. very, very disappointing. my daughter had a lot more trouble with it, as trying to click the on-screen button (that doesn't respond very well) caused a lot of the pictures to be blurry.by the way, the new camera is referred to as the 'wonder cam', as it now has a couple of options such as frames you can add to photos, however these options are disabled if you increase the size of your photos in the settings menu.software: the software is pretty much identical to the innotab 2, with addition of one game, 'magical bean stalk'. comparing the apps side-by-side between the innotab 2 and 3, everything looks the same. the music player and video player still have very limited options and are ultra-basic in features. the user menu screen appears three seconds quicker, and a few random actions that were clocked have shown the innotab 3 is very slightly faster then the innotab 2, but i doubt i would have noticed it without a stopwatch.the day after we received our innotab 3, we had some family and friends over and took the opportunity to pass around the innotab 2 and innotab 3... every single person thought the innotab 2 was a better tablet.back when we bought the first innotab, we put a lot of thought into whether we should get the innotab or the leappad. looking back, i think we probably made the wrong choice. the innotab has trotted along and has now clearly taken the turn towards 'cheaper' and 'simplier', while the leappad's price has increased, but has the added enough features each year to make it worthwhile.overall, the innotab 3 is certainly no improvement over the innotab 2. my daughters will stick with their innotab 2s for now. next year, i doubt my older daughter would be interested in an innotab 4, but i'm sure my younger daughter would be. i hope by then they actually come out with an improvement over the innotab 2, or else we will be leaping over to the leappad...",Negative,Negative,0.8543057

"i received this vtech innotab 3 last week and was excited because my daughters 5 and 7 have been asking for one so here it is and what a big let down. i first put the batteries in and turned it on, thought is was broken because it seemed to take for ever with the round circle in the screen but finely did start up and i was able to quicly set it up. next i let my girls play with it for a bit and then the really bad part happened. they asked if they could download a game to it and i said sure. i then plugged it into my macbook and it started to install the program for it but then locked up my computer and it closed out with errors. i then tried to install it again and again and it finally installed but took forever. next i plugged it in so i could down load a game but it kept saying to plug the device in but funny thing is it recognized it just fine to pull up the info that is on the toy. i tued forever to get it to work but no such luck.i then figured i would try a pc well pretty much exact same problems such as locking up the pc and all. after about 6 attempts the program installed but same exact problem with the pc not recognizing the toy when trying to down load a game. i went through a complete set of batteries just trying to get it o work. i done and moving on with something else that will hopefully work.unfortunately i really don't have any good comments about this innotab 3 and that is really rare for me to give bad reviews but looks like i ether received a bad unit or just poorly designed. oh and yes i did try uninstalling the program several times to no avail. thanks and hope this helps someone make a better purchase like probably a leapster or leap pad. i have had very good luck with them.",Negative,Negative,0.99165386

"i am not at all impressed by this tablet. the screen is small and does not interpret gestures the way we are now used to, the processor is incredibly slow by modern standards, the camera is so crappy it's a joke, and the cartridges and software are too costly. yes i know i'm looking at it through the eyes of an adult... maybe a kids won't notice the small screen. maybe kids won't mind the slowness, until they reach about 5 years old. beyond that, i think they will be sharp enough to become impatient with it too.i don't know how, in 2013, you could even come up with something this slow. you try to go anywhere from the ""home"" screen, and you have to look at some spinning ring of dots for 6 seconds or more. then you want to back up to ""home"" again, another 6 seconds. this is really annoying when the tablet misinterprets your touch and goes someplace you never wanted to go in the first place. they must have had to hire special slowness engineers to develop custom circuits this pokey. the web browser seems especially slow, taking minutes to show pre-selected sites i can find in seconds by google search on my desktop pc.the camera is so bad, indoors it is almost like looking through the dark filter in a welder's helmet... only light bulbs and bright white or yellow objects are even visible. outdoors on a sunny day it takes recognizable photos, but of very poor quality. they claim it is 2mp, but it is not even remotely close to my old 2mp nikon camera. i contacted vtech about the camera, and they replied some nonsense about trying different batteries. well i've got their special rechargeable battery packs, and everything besides the camera seems to function sorta ok; maybe i could stick pins in a voodoo doll instead and have the same chances of fixing the problem.i installed the ""learning lodge"" software on my desktop computer. after a rather lengthy installation, it seems to function ok. through it i got the one free software download, plus purchased another of similar value (about $3) and a set of songs that cost about $5. the $3 things are very lame; one consists of three short nursery rhyme songs accompanied by horrid crude cartoons that resemble paper cut-outs dangling from strings, and the other is a ""math magician"" whose mouth movements do not match his words. the $5 song set is 11 short songs, averaging a little over a minute long each, accompanied by a kaleidoscope-like moving color screen. the tablet also accepts cartridges, and one came with it. the one they included has three things on it: a short story about a dog that is read aloud by a voice and has some interactive cartoon features, a simple maze game, and a coloring book type activity. these things are actually ok as far as they go, but i see the price of additional cartridges is up close to $25 each. in my opinion, you are not getting a lot of value for your money with these cartridges and downloads. you could easily spend an additional $100 just to bring this tablet up to something reasonably well equipped to keep your kid entertained off and on for a few weeks.this tablet reminds me of a brand new tandy ""color computer"" i received free back around 1992. it might have been a great thing in 1985, but by 1992 it was so outmoded that i quickly realized that sinking any money into software or accessories was just foolish. in the present situation, my advice would be to wait until your kid was slightly older maybe, then get a good cheap 7 inch android tablet with a damage warranty plan. there are so many apps now available, there has got to be stuff suitable for kids out there. i bought such a tablet, an agptech, from amazon a year ago for under 85 bucks delivered and my only regret is the lack of bluetooth. it is tons faster and more versatile than this innotab. our daughter is only about 1 year old; i'll let her beat this innotab tablet around, but doubt i'll be buying any more software for it.",Negative,Negative,0.9947838

"cora was cute and a great idea but from the get go she was defective....she would stutter, repeating the same things over and over again. n she also would only play a few of the songs programmed and would go off after about 5 minutes, even if it was set for 15 or 30 minutes. she also would onlt say the first story that was programmed-- so it got very monotonous.  we liked the idea of cora and thought she was fun so we sent the defective one back and got another one in return. this time she seemed to be working fine---- for about a week, but then began to do the same thing with the stuttering.  it will work for about 5 sec. and then just stutter... it is super annoying. we have had tried reprogramming her... and everytime we do it works for about 5 mintues and then goes back to the same problem. another thing that i don't like is that the usb cord is hard to get into cora. it is so short and the little flap door that you have to open to stick it in is hard to keep open while trying to get the cord in.another thing that i didn't like that was that on some of the holidays she would say was next month when they were really 2 months away.anyway i liked the idea of cora and thought she was cute when she worked----- but there were way too many problems and now we just have to enjoy her as a stuffed bear and not a fun talking friend. would not recommend buying. go with a different brand.",Negative,Negative,0.9940352

"this is one of those games where you have to act out silly things in front of everyone and do all sorts of awkward things to and in front of the other players. this is the type of game that i would have maybe played in high school or college before i was married in a large group of friends, where there is a lot of flirting going on and people are in the mood to be silly and have some laughs. but now that i am married and my husband and i play games with other married friends, it just is not really the type of game we are into.there are three different categories of challenges you have to do: display your theatrical genius, wow with your trivial talents, and inspire with your creative brilliance.the trivia and creative brilliance challenges are pretty fun. the theatrical genius challenges mostly involve doing embarrassing things/acting out things/singing/other awkward stuff. if you are not into that kind of thing you will probably not like this game.here are some examples of the challenges:&#34;look longingly into the eyes of any player and tell him/her how much you love them and why.&#34;&#34;pretend you are a mad scientist and show/tell everyone your latest creation.&#34;&#34;sing 'happy birthday' like a mobster.&#34;&#34;pretend you are a drunken bird and fly around the room.&#34;&#34;you are the world's most celebrated avant-garde dancer. do an interpretive dance to the music in your head.&#34;&#34;pretend you're a cat trying to get your owner's attention. choose any player to be 'your owner.'&#34;so, there you have it. if you like being in the spotlight and acting things out and being silly then you will probably enjoy this game. if you are more reserved or don't feel like proclaiming love to your game buddies or interpretive dancing in front of your pals, then you should probably skip this one.",Negative,Positive,0.110836156

i was excited to try out this bouncing baby that looks so cute with her multitude of accessories.  she has a cute little voice but when i tried out the bottle and binkie her mouth didn't do anything.  i called the company and they said to try new name brand batteries.  finally i managed to get to the store and remember what size- 3 aa's.  not in the convenient double pack- you need a big pack or two small ones.  the batteries are not easily accessible as the little romper is sewn on.  new batteries made no difference.  in fact they look exactly like the old ones so i had to be careful to keep them separate from the extra new ones in the package.  i'm not a fan of toys requiring batteries to begin with.  i tried calling the company again but they close at 6 pm eastern time.  that makes it hard for those of us in the mountain or pacific time zones that work. they also aren't open on weekends.for 50 bucks i'd pass and get a nice soft cuddly doll that can survive a trip in the washing machine when needed and won't need batteries. this doll has weird legs with no padding when you go to diaper it.  not something a child is going to find attractive or desirable or easy to deal with.  the idea was good but it fails in execution.  it might be love at first sight but not the kind that endures for an extended period of time.update:  my daughter loves this doll.  after new batteries it still didn't seem to work but i switched the switch back and forth and the issues cleared up.  now the binkie  works just fine.  my teen says the doll is creepy but the younger sibling loves it and plays with it often.  glad to see it's also on sale or has a reduced price.,Negative,Negative,0.87677723

"wow i am so disappointed! i hate this toy! my 5 year old wanted it for christmas and we got it for him.  first issue: it takes forever to make car. you sit there for 10 minutes while it keep saying &#34;heating!&#34; then you pull the lever. then you sit there for 10 minutes while it says &#34;cooling!&#34; any kid is looking for something else to do way before you get to that point. so basically it's a toy you stare at for 20-25 minutes. second: you don't really have control over what colors the cars are! it comes with 2 sticks of wax already inserted, so your first 3 cars have those colors. the first car comes out solid colored, ours was purple. after that, they become mixed as the different wax sticks combine. i figure each car uses about 3/4 a tube of wax to make, some less, some more, so you always have some overflow from one stick to the next. so you have no control over your first 3 cars at least. then you can start inserting your own colors, but you have no idea how they are going to come out. we have a lot of really ugly cars. the machine provides enough stickers for about 6 cars, whch is good, but the expansion packs don't supply enough. so we now have too few stickers to decorate. i felt you needed the whole picture. in summary, it's boring, and there's very little creativity. then you have a bunch of ugly cars you may or not be able to play with because they will have to share the wheel bases it comes with. refills are way overpriced skip this one! i wish i did.",Negative,Negative,0.96484196
"my boys loved this car maker.  they learned all about injection molding and had a fabulous time christmas morning making cars.  they don't actually get to do too much of the process because the maker does most of it, but they didn't mind at all.  this was all they wanted to do on christmas morning...until it broke not once, but twice.  my son learned that if you don't load the wax sticks point first, two wax points will end up touching inside the first chamber and slip off of each other when you're trying to press the sticks in.  this creates a jam of two sticks stuck in the first chamber and no way to push them into the melting chamber.  the jam occurred where you can't easily access the sticks, so it took a long time for my engineer husband to fix the problem.  sure, my son should have loaded the wax with the point first, but this is a toy for kids--mattel should have anticipated things like wax jams would happen and at least create parental access to the chamber or at least make it harder for a wax jam to occur.  the wax sticks have tiny tips--it really isn't apparent the tip should go in first.  lesson learned.so, the first jam was repaired by my handy husband who designs things for a living.  my kids proceeded to make a half dozen more cars when the car maker broke...again.  who knows what's wrong with it this time.  my husband says he'll look at it later because the last repair sucked up an afternoon.  this toy should be more durable.  i don't spend $40 anticipating a toy will last an afternoon.  i was also lucky enough to find wax refills, so i dumped $25 on those, plus $10 on another mold set.  in total, i spent $75 on a toy that lasted a day.  not good, mattel.also, amazon won't let me return the car maker because i purchased it at the end of october from their holiday toy list for my kids for christmas.  what that holiday toy list didn't mention was that amazon's christmas return policy of a january 31 return deadline didn't start until november 1st.  so even though i purchased the item from their holiday toy list that was out at the end of october and didn't give the toy to my kids until christmas, i am unable to return it because 30 days has passed from my purchase date.  thanks, amazon.",Negative,Negative,0.9669163

"when my four year old boy saw a picture of this toy, he wanted it.  when i saw that it had ties to disney and pixar, i thought well, it should be fun and it should work, so i ordered it as part of the amazon vine program.  when it arrived, i handed to my eight year old son, who is very good at assembling these kind of toys (he enjoys and has had a lot of practice in building play train sets over the past several years).  but after about 5 minutes, he informed me that he wasn't interested in trying to build this.  ""well, ok"", i thought, ""maybe it's a little tough for him, but i'm an engineer.  how tough can it be?""  below are my thoughts on assembling and playing with this toy.well, first off it's a lot harder to build than it should be.  the instructions were just pictures and it wasn't always evident what was supposed to be connecting to what.  but worse, the parts don't all fit together well.  but after a short while, i had it assembled and ready to play.  the ""special"" part of the toy is that when the car goes down one lane, it triggers most of the track to revolve over a different track (there are two different track sections that flip).  when it works correctly, it's really neat.  but because the parts don't fit together well, it usually doesn't work.  worse, usually only one section of the track flips, and the different track styles don't link, so you have to stop and fix it.  the next problem is that the car is prone to jump the track or get stuck.  next problem ... the ""pumper"" has a tendency to jam, so you have to take the top part off and re-install (not difficult but something that happens a lot).  and even when it doesn't jam, it doesn't always work well enough to keep the car running.  next problem ... the parts snap together, but when you're pumping and playing, some of the parts unsnap themselves, usually messing up the track ""flip"".  well you get the picture.if the toy worked as it should, it could be a lot of fun.  but as it stands, it's a huge disappointment and i can't recommend it whatsoever.  score one for my eight year old; he wasted a lot less time on it than i did.  one star.",Negative,Negative,0.86625266
"we have a lot of micro drifters and some of the race sets like the motorized super speedway and design speedway. my grandson and i have lots of fun with these.so i decided that this looked like fun too. well, the toy works some times. it uses kid power to hurl the cars up the ramp by pushing on a knob. on the radiator springs side of the toy, they have a flat surface attached at the top of the upward ramp. many times it seems the car hits it and slides back down. i took it off and the cars went up cleanly most of the time, but you run the risk of cars flying off the product this way.the toy has one trick it does. when it is in radiator springs mode if you go down the center lane the track flips to a piston cup speedway. the top half always flipped for me using the the lane director as the trigger. the lane at the bottom uses a brown flap that unlocks the lane and a gray director to trigger flipping the lane. it flipped maybe once every 10 times for me, leaving the track inoperative since the parts do not match when only the top half flips. it leaves a giant gap. once it flips to the piston cup speedway, it stays there. i found that the blue lane has a blue tab that is triggered by the lane director. i took an emery board and shaved a couple strokes at a time until it worked. about then, the kid powered booster fell apart. after digging a small metal piece and the gray plastic piece that fits on the end of the screw drive from the bottom of the housing, i put it back together, but it seems like it isn't as powered as it was before. doesn't seem possible but it does. since there is a small cylindrical metal piece holding the end of the spring together, i can see why it fell apart. if you push down on the button without allowing it to come all the way back to the top, it looses tension and the metal piece can work its way out. if they spent an extra nickel and screwed it on, it wouldn't fall out. lastly, i tried many different cars on the track. i had less than stellar results getting the cars to traverse the track consistently. many times they turned sideways and were stuck or just wouldn't go up the up ramp and slid back down. this was such a downer product, i placed it in the trash.the motorized super speedway is a far superior product.i have rated other toys in this series very highly so i am disappointed with this one. maybe your luck will be different. if not, i think i have given some tips on how to get it working if you have the same problem.",Negative,Negative,0.97805893

"i got this free from vine, thank god - if i'd paid a penny for this i'd be livid.  i'm angry just at having it in my house.  it's so bad i can't  even give it away because i think that would be cruel to the receiver.first, putting it together is a nightmare.  the directions have no words and the pictures are completely unclear.  it also comes with the decals separate and you have to actually follow more directions to figure out where to put all the stickers.  i really hate when toy makers make me put on their stickers.once i finally got it together, i was sure i must have done something wrong or been missing a piece, because in many places it had big gaps where the picture on the box shows the pieces fitting together. i waited for the engineer husband to get home and fix it, but he only confirmed my fears - that the toy was actually as it was supposed to be.putting aside the rickety, non-fitting nature of the thing, the more important issue is that it didn't work.  you are supposed to push down the red button, slide the car into the cylinder, and it shoots it out the other side.  but at first when we pushed down on the red button, it didn't budge.  it was stuck somehow.  we jiggled it around a bit and got that working - most of the time - but when the car goes in, about half the time it just gets stuck in there.  i had to fish it out with a pencil.on rare occasions when the car did shoot out, on the blue track side it just flew right off the track.  the brown track worked ok.  but the brown track side wouldn't stay flipped down.  you flip it over and it swings right back.  it doesn't hold in place.now to all this frustration add a whining 4 year old who really wants to play with his new toy.this toy is completely awful.  don't buy it.",Negative,Negative,0.9952486
"when they were sitting around, thinking ""what new toy can we come up with?"", on paper, this must have sounded like a great idea - kids can race their favourite cars movie characters around a track which flips between willy's butte and the piston cup race. what's not to love, right?unfortunately, what emerged was something flimsy and poorly executed....and i'd be upset at paying full retail price for it.so let's begin at the beginning.there was no clear easy-open option and after some tugging at the end flaps, i finally ripped the box open. it seems someone delighted in using something akin to superglue to seal the box with, so it took me approximately 2 mins to open the darned thing.next came sorting out the pieces and applying the stickers. this took an additional 18 mins to do.then came the assembly, which entailed deciphering the single sheet with all pictures (no text). this took an additional 25 mins to do. all told from when i when to open it up to when it was finally finished and ready to be used, 45 mins (so be prepared, those of you wanting to give this as a christmas gift).in case you're wondering at the length of time, i work as a supervisor for a customer care center for a large rta furniture company, so i'm not a complete idiot when it comes to instruction sheets or assembly of products.there is a pump on the toy that shoots the cars round the track. my one was, at first, jammed up. eventually, i grew frustrated with it and slammed it....whatever i did worked and it started pumping, rotating the mechanism.the flipping section of the unit is haphazard, flipping over when you least expect or want it to. i've yet to try using multiple cars on the track, but i had a hard enough time getting just one car to function properly on it. in all honesty, i found the piston cup race section easier to use on the car. i did manage to get the car to go round a few times on the track, although occasionally i found it flying off the track or sliding round on its side.i will be giving this to my grandson, although i suspect he will have a hard time with the pump, and will probably just push the cars around by hand. there is nothing of educational value in this toy (other than how to hit a pump, and in my experience that's hardly something that a child needs to be taught) and i'm somewhat concerned of the durability.i think it will have limited appeal to kids who are die-hard fans of cars (the movie). otherwise, i think it's probably best giving this one a pass, certainly at the price point at which it's being offered.",Negative,Negative,0.9540957

"my son has the disney/pixar cars micro drifters fast-flip carry case which goes with this and he loves it. this item, however, is not the best race track to get.first, it's a bear to put together. many different parts and stickers that don't really fit where they are supposed to go, make this at least an hour project for the parent. maybe more if you aren't good at matching up the diagrams with the instruction sheet, which is not an easy task. i'm not usually one who gets tripped up by instruction sheets, but there are a couple of items that look very similar and are easy to confuse on this one. also, one of the attachments was so hard to click together right, i spent 15 minutes, just on that one thing.when the track was finally together, we tried it out, but it didn't work exactly right. the cars tend to jam in the pump-action booster and by the third try, i was ready to give up. my son was eager to play, though, so he worked with it for about 20 more turns before the track actually ""flipped"" like it's supposed to. the track flip was pretty cool, but it doesn't work all the way. the round part of the track flips, but the arm that extends down to the booster only turns half way because it is too big to make a full circle without hitting the ground. for that arm to work, you would have to have two steady surfaces on other end of the track with nothing under that one arm so it could turn full circle. we tried that, but it still had trouble turning all the way around.you get one lightning mcqueen car for this track and the track only works with two cars. thankfully, my son had another car to use with it. basically, the first car goes and sets off a lever, then when the second car goes, the track will flip. without the second car, no flippage.another problem with this track is that when the cars are ""let go"" into the booster, they tend to flip over or go sideways, getting stuck in the booster. my son could not figure out how to get them out, so i was fishing them out about every ten minutes. at one point, the booster jammed (after about an hour of play) and we thought it was broke forever. there were no cars inside or jamming the system... after about 30 mins, it miraculously wasn't jammed anymore. after that first jam, it jams every once in awhile... probably about 3 times a day.a safety hazard is needed for anyone sitting next to the track. about every 3rd car will go flying off the track and land across the room. my son loves this, but if he were playing with another kid, he would be black and blue by now.all this said, my son still loves playing with it, because it is cars and because he gets to flip cars across the room, but it does not operate as stated.",Negative,Negative,0.9345966

"no, really? is this a disney product? the flip in my case never worked. the tracks do not match and the cars get stuck. this was a gift and fortunately i did not spent a cent on this piece of junk. but unfortunately someone else did and my son could have had a toy that he could play with!i'm really disappointed, disney must make a recall and give back the money or a coupon with the same value spent.",Negative,Negative,0.9962192
"i bought this doll for my four year old daughter for christmas after she saw it in a store in november. when we took it out of the package, no amount of yanking and tugging (straight down, left to right, everything) would get the skirt to come down and the tail to go up.  figuring that we got one that was defective, i returned it for another one.  the same thing happened! the product is poorly designed and does not seem to work.  even if i could have forced the skirt to come out, there was no way my four year old was going to be able to do it on her own.  i returned this doll and bought her mariposa barbie instead. also, the doll is advertised to sing when you pull the tail.  it does, but it is a 2 second snippet of the song.  it barely starts before it is over. it wasn't even long enough to enjoy listening to.  awful product, mattel. back to the drawing board on this one.",Negative,Negative,0.99822694

"even though i received this for free through vine, i have to agree with the previous reviewer. this toy looks nice enough, but not only is the price too steep, it doesn't even come with an ariel doll! for the price, i would think the manufacturers could have at least bundled an ariel doll with it. my daughter happened to have an old ariel doll and several other disney princess dolls, so she could actually create a story around the ship and play with her friends, but anyone looking to purchase this set by itself need to keep in mind that there is no doll included.the set itself is nice enough. once assembled (doesn't take much time at all), the set is a ship when folded up, and when opened, it reveals an 'under-the-sea' area with several accessories that little girls can use to create stories. all the accessories are made of plastic but once again, i did not think these accessories were especially unique to merit such a hefty price tag. ariel's bed is included here with a starfish-shaped 'pillow', a vanity with two-sided mirror , an ocean-themed nightstand with a lamp, treasure chest, platter, and other decorations. there are also some beauty items such as a perfume bottle, compact in the shape of a shell, necklaces, tiaras (for the dolls which are not included). the top of the ship has a steering wheel and stand that can hold two dolls. as a playset, it is cute, but unfortunately, the lack of interactive features and doll/s is disappointing considering the price.",Negative,Negative,0.9893156
"this thing reminds me of the junk that ends up in the bottom of a toybox. i hate to be so harsh, but neither i or my daughter cared for it. it was a pain to put together. it wobbles when set up. it is like a bedroom for ariel that turns into a ship and holds her up on the ship. i understand what they were going for, but i just do not like the final product. my daughter gave up on it when it fell over twice and messed up her little bedroom she had set up. sometimes i say that a toy is a good toy, but my daughter just did not like it. in this case i think it is just not the best toy.",Negative,Negative,0.9513753
"sometimes reviews for kids toys such as this are difficult.as an adult you look at issues like cost, quality, durability, ease of use, whether a toy will be valued and treasured long enough to justify what you paid for it, etc.  kids, however, generally either like or dislike a toy--and that's that :>)so, this toy arrives via the amazon vine program.  i am to provide a fair and impartial review.  here goes:1st impression: wow, that's a big box, i bet this is going to be a great toy!2nd impressio:, box opened and for $50 you get a lot of little pieces of plastic to put together.  for $50 there should be an ariel and eric doll included.3rd impression: the instructions aren't very good and a couple of pieces do not stay affixed like they should--anticipate trouble down the road with durability once in play4th impression: she's going to love this!now that the toy is ""in play"" i can say that my biggest issue is the price.  this is a $20 toy, period.  i took off 2 stars for that.  my 5yr old granddaughter enjoys it, but it isn't on her favorite toy list.  i bought her a mermaid barbie from a discount store to use in the ship, so cost would be at $62 to play this set within it's ""theme"".  it would have cost closer to $70 with an ariel doll.like most little girls, mine loved all the little pieces to play with--arranging and rearranging them and making up stories.  she liked that the ship opened to become ariel's bedroom.  however, had i not bought the added mermaid doll she would not have played with it as much...and she is still asking for an eric doll like ""in the picture""...sigh.  that would put this playset at $100 and that is just crazy for a bunch of cheap plastic.  i took off 1 star because this isn't well made or durable.nutshell, granddaughter likes it, but i would never have paid $50 for this.",Negative,Negative,0.66040444
"without meaning this to come across as too harsh, i would present just one caveat for this product - you're paying $50 for a plastic boat that doesn't include a doll of the character for whom it is apparently intended.this toy does have some appeal for those young kids who want a ship for ariel, and who already have ariel or other dolls from the set.  the colors are nice, but the craftsmanship is not great, and my guess it that this boat would cost about half the price were it not for the disney name.  i also wasn't impressed with having to do any assembly given the price tag.just a disappointing toy overall, with nothing that makes it stand out.  certainly not recommended at this price.",Negative,Negative,0.99145484
"i just can't think much past the price in reviewing this item. the ship is a nice little toy, something a little one can be entertained by for a time here and there. but almost $50, and it doesn't even come with an ariel or other figure? i just don't see where anyone could have come up with that price tag. as a reviewer i got this for free, but if i had to pay for it i wouldn't want to spend more than about $15. it just doesn't have, or do, enough to make it worth that cost. the toy itself is kind of neither here nor there - nothing wrong with it but nothing all that exceptional about it, either.",Negative,Negative,0.99365956
"mattel toys are a hit or miss for me. in this case, it was a massive miss.my daughter was so excited when she saw this ship. i personally was not when i saw how many pieces came with it. there are no tools required, it all snaps together. however, it is poorly made. she has had it for several weeks and i can't tell you how many times the parts have snapped apart. the first day the slide would not even stand up. the slide is two parts and just sits on top of the other part but it has never stayed in place. the instructions were not the easiest to follow, some parts i had to put together and guess. also the picture is very deceptive, it looks big, and it is not! i know there are measurements for the toy and i would note the size first.one thing i did like is that you basically can play with any of your barbie's with this. my daughter did not know it was for one in particular so she was using the other barbie's she had. i think that is honestly the only positive thing i can think of with this toy.for the price range, there are so many other toys out there. i waited to write the review several weeks after my daughter had it to see how long she used it. she used it for a few days and it just sits there now. if it gets knocked over it will open up and most of the contents come out and it is very frustrating to put them all back in and try to line up the top of the boat to lock it all up.do yourself a favor and pass on this one. there are much better toys out there in this price range. i honestly would not even spent ten dollars on it. mattel makes good things, this is just not one of them.",Negative,Negative,0.99163765

"we were so excited when we ordered this plane because what little boy doesn't love remote controls and airplanes. the design seemed rather ingenious--the child puts little wings on his hands, and extends his arms to remotely control the airplane. sounds simple enough, looks simple enough, and even a toddler could do it, right? uh, not so fast.first, the plane doesn't actually fly. sure, it tells you this on the box, but only in a print that is pretty darned tiny relative to everything else on the box. but the remote has to be easy enough to use, right? well, in theory, if you've got about an acre of pure, open space for your child to play in, this controller could work great. but in the backyard of my track home? not so much. in my house? not at all. the plane moves both too fast and in too big an arc to allow a kid to really control it. it seems like my son could barely get it moving before the plane would hit a wall or end up under the sofa. at first, i thought it was because he's just shy of two and still lacking in hand-eye-coordination. but then i tried it. and my 7 year old tried it. and my husband tried it. and none of us were especially successful at getting this plane to go in a straight line much less navigate through the house.all this wouldn't be so bad if we could just ignore the remote and play with the plane itself. but when we took the batteries out of the remote and just left them in the plane, it quit producing sound.the look of the plane is really cute, but this just isn't a practical toy for kids of any age.",Negative,Negative,0.9727276

"my daughter could not wait to play with ""the barbie digital makeover mirror."" yes, you have to remove your otter box or any other protective cover to insert this in the stand. common sense and supervision will keep your ipad from damage. it takes aa batteries for the ""lights"" to work. in order for the lights to work and everything else, you also have to be paired with your bluetooth connectivity. you have to download the app from the itunes store.  you take a picture of yourself with your ipad camera and off you go. unfortunately, this toy does not perform well due to the bluetooth constantly losing connection. the facial tracking works somewhat for the ""demo"" makeup, but not when you try to put your own makeup on. when you move your head, the makeup does not stay in place like they lead you to believe. half the time, the make up wand does not work to pick up the colors and you have to go back and try all over again. this ended up leaving my daughter all frustrated and she has not played with it since. we did have a few good laughs with this initially, because the ""demo"" makeup is really funny and my son was using it and making crazy facial expressions. i think the price tag is way too high and the product way too glitchy for me to recommend this.",Negative,Negative,0.99493647

"my daughter is 17 months and loves to watch me in the kitchen so i thought this would be a great learning tool for her and being fisher price, i had high hopes. boy was i disappointed! first of all, it was very easy to put together but the plastic feels so cheap and flimsy! she has knocked the entire thing down twice just by lightly pushing on it and it's not heavy at all to keep it in place so it's also not sturdy. another complaint i have is that the picture of the pie in the oven and the backsplash images are printed on cheap cardboard and are only held in by tiny tabs so my daughter has easily removed them and ripped one. kids can push right through them; fisher price would've been better off making these stickers to stick to the flat surfaces so they'd at least stay in place. the purple pan doesn't sit flush on the burner and while i like that it has little hooks to hang up the cups, there should be something to store the dishes and other accessories in instead of having to put them in the oven. but the most annoying part of this kitchen of all is that dora's voice talks nonstop and the child doesn't even have to do anything to make her talk - the things she says don't even correspond to what the child is doing. if my daughter is playing with the pans on the burners, it talks about the sink. where's the educational value in that? also, the spanish voice sounds muffled and you can't really understand it.the one positive thing i can say is that we do love the accessories and they are made of good quality. it comes with a spatula, cups, plates, pans, and play food such as chicken, macaroni and cheese, and eggs. but i'm sorry i just cant see that this is worth the $50 price tag - the quality is worth maybe $10 if that. so my advice is use the money you'd spend on this piece of junk and put it towards a higher quality set like thestep2 lifestyle custom kitchen ii, brown/tan/green. my nieces and nephew have this step 2 kitchen and it's totally worth the extra money because it's made of heavy duty plastic and is very sturdy and more life like. sorry dora, but your kitchen is terrible.",Negative,Negative,0.9848498

"ever since more inexpensive r/c cars appeared, back around the 1980's, i've always wanted to try one. but it was never a big enough interest for me to actually lay down the money to get one. well now i finally have one, and frankly it is quite a disappointment.when i first tried this car out, it was so feeble that i was sure the included batteries were almost dead. so i bought new batteries, but it still has no power. you'd think a car with rugged suv looks and huge knobby tires could go through some rough terrain, right? wrong. obviously a $50 toy won't drive through a wheat field or a cattail swamp, but i had envisioned it chasing my dog around the mowed lawn. not even close. it gets hung up on a tuft of grass growing through a crack in the sidewalk. it does not even have enough power to go uphill on the slightly inclined but very smooth asphalt paved parking pad in front of my house.from a mechanical point of view, i expected this car to have a high-revving dc motor driving the wheels through a worm gear or other high reduction gear arrangement. instead it appears to be more or less direct drive, and rolls freely on any slight hill if neither forward or reverse is commanded. there is no ""engine braking"" effect. in light of that, it is not surprising to me now that the power is so lacking. where other reviewers comment on slow top speed, i myself would give up a bit of speed for some ""off-road"" capability.the battery compartments are held shut by screws, making battery changes a pain. the construction looks pretty cheapo, but i will admit the car has bounced off table legs a few times now without any damage.this is a fun car for kids... provided their friends don't all have something better. it is fun indoors or on a perfectly flat paved parking lot. and maybe my expectations were just unrealistic; i never had any other r/c car to compare it with. but i certainly would not buy another one.",Negative,Negative,0.81208205

"orbeez luxury spa / b00ci6jpnci'm really dreading this review, because i had expected to like this and came away really disappointed. full disclosure: i do not have children. i ordered this because the product description specifically called out that the item is also for adults and that ""even your mother or father can enjoy the orbeez spa experience"". i also have been *really* wanting a foot massager / pedicure experience, and i love the orbeez (we have some in vases) so i figured this would be fun and pleasurable.first: this spa-toy was a huge pain to setup. there are no batteries included, and it takes c batteries for the bouncy motor and lr44 button/watch batteries for the light show. we don't keep either on hand, but luckily we had some c ""adaptors"" from eneloop which turn aa batteries into c-sized ones. (this proved aggrieving later when the metal spiral in the battery case snagged on the adaptor case, but that's not the fault of the spa-toy.) the battery cases are screwed into place, with soft metal screws that tried to strip as soon as we touched them. coaxing the metal screws out of the plastic case was particularly difficult; we eventually had to insert a thin paring knife to ""lever upward"" while my husband gently worked the screw up. (at one point he seriously suggested breaking the case open because it was proving so difficult to open.)second: i should have anticipated this, but i forgot that orbeez have to soak overnight in order to plump up. some kid is going to open this and want to get to it right away only to be told they have to wait! that's not *such* a big deal, but these are the most delicate orbeez i've ever seen! we have some stronger ones in our vases, but these fall apart if you squeeze them too hard. i was super-careful with the spa, but even with my feet moving gently through the orbs, there were still bunches of shreds to strain off afterward. this leads me to believe that the orbs won't last long, which means having to buy lots of replacement packets, but also means that you can't get around the overnight soak by just keeping some always plumped and ready to go. so whoever uses this is going to have to always know several hours in advance that they want to use it.(there's also no cover for the spa, so if you leave the orbeez in the bucket, you'll need to place it high enough that smaller children or pets won't eat them. and you'll also want to store it somewhere where the kids can't knock it over and spill everything.)third: the bouncy / massagey area is one circular drum in the very center. it doesn't bounce the balls much, nor does it do a particularly thrilling massage. while the marketing says all sizes of feet fit in the bucket, you have to crowd your feet into the exact center to get the actual massage experience. the model they used in the instructions has her feet spaced a normal amount apart -- i can almost guarantee she's getting absolutely no vibration on the heels or toes, and only a partial amount on the soles of her feet. i find that very disappointing. i think this would work for small children, but not for people with larger feet. (i'm a us size 9, for the record.)fourth: the drum is fairly loud. we used it on carpet and on hardwood floors and it was very annoying to listen to in both cases. it also feels like it's shaking the entire toy, so i'm wondering how durable the plastic material is going to be over time.fifth: the orbeez are cold. well, no problem, right? the marketing specifically says: ""and get this, it now comes with a massage function, a warming feature and a light show."" so we'll just turn on the warming feature! except that the ""warming feature"" is you pouring hot water into the spa. if it gets cold, you dump the water out and pour in new hot water. i guess i shouldn't have expected an actual heating feature in a kids' toy, but i'm not really thrilled with having to turn off my foot massage, dry my feet, walk to the kitchen, wait 5 minutes for the sink water to heat up, and then pouring that in so i can resume my massage. i guess mom/dad/spouse is supposed to wait on you? except that you have to pour the cold water out before adding the hot, so either way there's not a seamless way to continue the massage once the water has chilled.sixth: buy refills. the spa comes with 15 packets of orbeez, and the instructions call for using 5 packets in the spa at a time. (though my 5 packets didn't make the spa look nearly as full as the marketing photos.) those 5 packets' worth looked pretty ratty after 3 extremely careful / gentle sessions with an adult trying to 'baby' the orbs. i would guess there's maybe 10-15 uses of the spa packaged here, and then you'll need to buy more. so if this review has made you whip out your wallet, make sure you also buy some orbeez replacements now while you're doing your holiday shopping.---as i said at the beginning, i really wanted to like this spa and was expecting to go easy on it because it *is* a kids' toy at the end of the day. but there's a lot about this that seems really shoddy and even sneaky -- i'm annoyed at marketing which calls adding hot water a ""warming feature"", which mentions that c batteries are required but doesn't call out the lr44s, and which pictures a model whose feet are placed incorrectly in a tub which is staged to look fuller than yours will. kids care about their toy looking like the marketing (or at least *i* did as a kid), and so that kind of bait-and-switch bothers me.and while i like orbeez and i love the concept, in the end this feels like a problem in search of a market; the glossy paper ad included in the box (in contrast to the black-and-white instructions) shows orbeez waterfalls and orbeez mood lamps and orbeez magic crystal balls and orbeez animal-shaped keychains. you get the impression that there's an warehouse somewhere full of surplus orbeez and they're churning out cheaply-made toys trying to desperately use them up. but if that's the case, why didn't they use the sturdy kind that we keep in our vase (and which break only under actual duress) rather than these flimsy ones that fall apart if you look at them wrong? i don't know.shorter version: i wouldn't buy this for a child (and i have nieces to shop for!) because of the frustrating setup and long prep time, the lack of storage for the orbeez, the noise of the motor, and the unpleasant aspects of the massage itself (specifically, having to hold your feet in the exact center and the coldness of the orbs). and i certainly wouldn't buy this for an adult, because while an adult could navigate the logistical problems better, they're more likely to want an actual massage and not a colorful gimmick. so take my opinion for whatever you think it's worth.note: this review is based on a free advance review copy of this product provided through amazon vine.~ ana mardoll",Negative,Negative,0.96371144
"i thought this was going to be a great purchase, as my toddler loves to draw so much.  the light-up feature, plus it being see-through, seemed like they would make this a toy of choice in the car.  it didn't turn out that way.  first, the ink doesn't show up neon-like the picture shows.  it's a little hard to see the ink in many lights.  also, the light-up feature is kind of a let down.  it works, but not like the picture.  so...it doesn't much appeal over the fischer price classic doodler-which gets way more use in my house (plus doesn't have pens that need to be replaced).  save your money.",Negative,Negative,0.95973104

"the idea of this toy was really great but for the most part it was a big disappointment.  these were my issues:markers- these markers are way too light.  the pictures on the package and on the listing page is a big misrepresentation.  the pictures show colors that really stand out.  these are so light you can barely tell what color was used.  the 4-year-old girl that i babysit even told me ""these don't work"".  she also had difficulty getting the lids off and back on.  she brought them to me several times to pop the lids off and when i went to pick them up, none of the lids were on all the way.  i also noticed that as she was coloring and her sleeve would brush against her drawing, her picture would smear.eraser- after pumping the eraser many times to finally get it moist, i tried it out and it worked great.  it wasn't so easy for the girl that i babysit for.  like most little ones her age, they don't hold things the way an adult or older kid would.  she wraps all her fingers around the eraser and just swipes it messily back and fourth like a child does when they're scribbling.  i showed her over and over had to properly swipe it but she just wasn't getting the hang of it.  the problem is she's wasting a lot of the eraser solution and there doesn't seem to be much in there to start with.  what happens when this solution runs out?  the way she uses it, that won't be too long.  although it looks like water, i'm sure it's not and not that i'd want to purchase more erasers but i don't even see where they sell those individually if i wanted to.hanging- the idea of hanging the mat on the door seems like a good idea but if you do that you can't take advantage of the straps & storage pouch at the top that hold the markers, eraser and drying cloth.  why?  what kid that is at an age that would be playing with this mat can reach to the top of a door?  there is a different storage pouch at the bottom on the back of the mat that can be used though.so with all my issues is there anything i like about this thing?  sure, the size is great and the roll-up design and storage areas is nice.  there was just too many problems to allow me to suggest anyone buy this.",Negative,Negative,0.94416994

"this product seemed like a great idea to me---a plastic floor mat that you could color on with color magic markers.  my daughter has recently gotten quite into coloring, and always is wanting more paper and bigger paper, so this seemed like it would be a terrific way to give her that and then be able to erase and reuse the surface.  well, it would have been great...basically, the color magic markers just don't show up on the plastic.  you can just barely, barely see where you color.  and that is after the about 5 second delay there always is with color magic markets to see any color at all, making it very frustrating for young artists even when you can see the colors.  but in this case, anything we colored looked like the long ago shadows of something written on a whiteboard and erased---like the hint of an old picture left over.  the box shows kids coloring vivid pictures, and there is no way on earth you could do that with these markers.the set also included a little eraser---sort of the shape of a razor with a liquid in the handle that went onto a little sponge-like area where the razor surface would be.  this was supposed to erase what was colored, once you primed it.  it's ironic that always the colors barely showed up, this erase did very little to erase the minor bit of color there was.  it worked much better to use the enclosed washcloth, even dry.i'm trying to think of some positive here.  the mat did have good storage areas for the markers and washcloth, and it rolled up well.  if the colors had worked, it would be a good product.  i wish they had.",Negative,Negative,0.8584876

"i had high hopes for this because my sister's kids had the aquadoodle mat and this, i thought, was basically the same thing...not!!! i was extremely let down by crayola's poor quality product. i'll start by saying the one positive thing i can say is that i liked the carrying handle and the bands inside to hold the markers and the drawing surface is large, but that doesn't matter considering that you can't even see what you're drawing because the markers are so light (unlike the bright colors shown on the box = false advertisement) it's basically like invisible ink! of the four markers included, the yellow and orange are the worst and don't even show up! the green comes out looking gray and the purple comes out a very very light pink.yet another issue with this piece of junk is that if your child so much as touches the ink on the mat, it smudges off the mat and all over their hands. also, if you leave the ""color,"" if you can call it that, on the mat too long (about an hour), it stains the mat and no amount of wiping will get it off. finally, they claim the ""wet"" eraser  will erase the marker in one swipe - not so because you have to push down on it and swipe at the same time several times to remove the marker. my daughter was so disappointed with this and we are going to get theaquadoodle - draw n doodle - classic matinstead because on that we can actually see our drawings! don't waste your money on this epic crayola fail! i can't even believe that this product made it out into society because it's such poor quality.",Negative,Negative,0.9977951

"while this toy seems like it should be appealing, there are some drawbacks that limit the appeal, and even to the extent it is appealing, it wears off rather quickly.  within an hour of opening this toy both of my daughters were at the table drawing on ordinary paper with regular markers.to begin with, this toy takes three aa batteries which are, of course, not included.  once inserted, the toy lights up with a series of different patterns, depending on how many times the child presses the buttons.  for instance, the lights can flash alternating lights, or light up from the center outwards or the outside inwards.  in the end, though, the different effects aren't distinct enough to keep kids' attention.  furthermore, the lighting effects are nowhere near as brilliant as the box shows (which my six-year-old daughter noted with due irritation).the toy requires specific gel markers which come with the toy, so when those markers run out/dry, you'll have to find other special ones (although i understand that ordinary dry-erase markers work as well, but those don't come cheap either).  also, it is rather difficult to completely clean the board for the next picture - you'll either go through a lot of paper towels or have to rinse out a cloth a couple times each time you need to clean the board.  and then the child has to wait until the board is completely dry before drawing again.  patience is a virtue, i suppose.finally, we found that the stand tends to pop out rather easily, causing the board to fall in mid-drawing.  to the extent they've used it at all, my kids tend to draw with it on the floor and then stand it up to watch the lighting effects.the one very positive feature is the built-in marker holders on the back, so at least you won't lose the markers.  they only hold the original markers, however, so if you get some other kind to replace those, they won't fit in the holder.our two daughters (ages four and six) have played with this toy only a handful of brief times each and even the friends and cousins we've had over have taken only a brief turn or two.i recommend skipping this product - it's too expensive for the minimal fun your children will likely get out of it.  i haven't looked at lite brite recently, but that was one of my favorite toys as a kid, and infinitely better than this toy - check into that instead.",Negative,Negative,0.9389867

"i expect markers to mark. if you are selling markers this should be the main thing that they do. the markers on this toy do not work well. sure they mark, supposedly only on the pad (though they marked my shirt) they left very faint colors on the pad. it was almost like they had no ink in them. they were faint and hardly able to be seen.pros:fits on kids lapon board storage for markers (underneath)storage for markers on topkids seem to enjoy wiping with included cleaning toolcons:cannot see colorsno on board storage for cleaning toolmarkers smell awfulmarkers do indeed mark other things other than board.overall, not worth the money. crayola should stick to their crayons which are still the best out there.",Negative,Negative,0.7772203
"i nabbed this for my kids from the amazon vine program (twin 6-year olds and a 1-year old). i thought this would be great on long car trips.its not.the markers did not even last the 5 hour car trip before dying out.the pad that they draw is incapable of handling thick lines and thus, almost nothing can be sufficiently colored in. thus, like my kids, your kids are going to be disappointed that they can't create the artwork they intended to create.i expected more from such a reputable company.glad my version was free so i can help others.cheers,todd",Negative,Negative,0.85844713
"to say i am disappointed with this toy would be an understatement.  let me make a list of pros and cons...pros:my daughter liked cleaning it off using the included cleaning instrument.the package was very easy to open.the markers don't mark on other surfaces, but the instructions say to not mark on any surface that cannot be laundered. okay then.cons:the markers smell awful.the tops of the markers are very difficult to remove.the markers are very difficult to pull out of the holders on the lap desk.the markers barely even show up on the surface!  how awful for a product that is made for coloring! a total disgrace.the markings begin to fade soon after drawing on the board. the art begins to disappear before the drawing is even finished. how frustrating.the pictures erase when a child reaches across the board for a marker and their clothing or arm touches the art work.seriously, this product is really bad.  shame on you, crayola, for fooling people into thinking it will be awesome.  i could expect this from an off-brand company, but crayola is supposed to be the gold standard for kids art; at least i believed that until now. i am in shock they would put their name on such a terrible product.  the usability of this product is frustrating and disappointing at best. i rated it two stars, though, because my daughter got at least 10 minutes play out of it before she was as annoyed as i was.",Negative,Negative,0.99822575
"so . . . i requested this because it looked clever.  every parent occasionally needs something kids can write with that won't get on everything.  the idea of color drawing that works only on one surface appealed to me for my over enthusiastic 2 year old.  the lap desk comes with a wiping cloth, an eraser brush and four supposedly color special markers.  the eraser brush and markers fit in grooves in the back for easy storage.i might be worthwhile. if the markers worked.  you know that adorable label on the cover with the house?  if you think you can draw like that on the tablet i'm afraid you're out of luck.  i pulled out the first marker and we tried it . . . and it barely left a scrap of really faded color across the area.  i thought maybe it was the marker, so i tried again.  all the markers are like that.  there's no  real color at all,  my son has to press super hard with the marker, destroying the point of the marker to make it show up for a few seconds.i could argue on top of this that a set of markers that has red and yellow and green should also have blue, not orange--but it's really pointless.  the crayons don't work.  i thought maybe i had a defective set, then i saw the other reviews which essentially say the same.poor product.  i'll go back to using a magnetic drawing tablet with my kids.  it's more effective.",Negative,Negative,0.9851916
"my daughter loves to color and draw, so i thought the crayola doodle magic lap desk would make a great addition to our home.  the lap desk was very well thought out.  the size is perfect for kids ages 3-15 (as the manufacturer suggests).  the markers do not stain items, as they can only be used on the lap desk.  the desk has holders that are appropriate for the markers--both on top and underneath the desk.  it comes with a handy eraser, that makes cleaning the desk super simple, and a wipe is included for drying the desk.  sounds great, right?  not quite...the markers are very poor.  if a picture is being drawn, you would expect to see it.  not with the crayola doodle magic lap desk.  the markers create very faint lines, that are hard to see.  the colors are not as bright as the markers suggest.  the closest thing i can compare it to is watercolor paint, but much lighter.i expect more from crayola products, as they have an outstanding reputation for their markers and crayons.  for twenty-five bucks, i would spend my money on something better.  this barely kept my little one's attention for 10 minutes, as she had trouble seeing her pictures and became frustrated.",Negative,Positive,0.30453134

( i suspect this is a light dish soap concoction)the board still feels like it has a wax build up on it even after it's cleaned and on the places that that is the thickest feeling, the markers won't leave any color at all.my advice is to buy a wipe-off board at a dollar store and a box of washable markers. you'll spend less $ and have a happier little artist than i had.",Negative,Positive,0.31603992
"i can only describe my feelings about the doodle magic lap desk as disappointed.i received this item through amazon vine, and had i paid for it, i would replace ""disappointed"" with ""angry.""  the concept is a home run, but the execution is a total failure.  the main issue revolves around the markers.  the fumes are noxious, and while i'm speaking figuratively, i have concerns that they may literally be dangerous as well, which results in my child not getting to use them.  when we first got it, and before i realized how terrible they smell, my wife and i noticed that the markers also seemed faded.  the bright, cheery colors on the box's example in no way match our product's capabilities.i love the idea of this product, and we thought it would be a delight for traveling, but, unfortunately, the markers rendered it unusable.",Negative,Negative,0.9983272
"my almost 3-year-old son got this as a christmas present. i thought he would really enjoy it, and given that it was a crayola product, i had high hopes.we eventually sat him down in front of it and gave him a marker. he scribbled on the board, looked a little confused, and said it didn't work. i gave him another marker, same deal. i thought for sure he must be doing something wrong (e.g., not pressing hard enough), but no dice. all four markers barely made any marks on the surface.i figured maybe we got a bum lot of markers, so maybe i could just find some new markers and it would be all good, right? apparently not, according to others' reviews here, which i'm glad i checked before purchasing new markers.so basically this product fails miserably at its only function.i'm so sorry we threw out the packaging before we tested it out. i never thought a crayola product would be this disappointing. now i can't even return it.",Negative,Negative,0.99720395

"if you purchase this toy, it will be the most expensive lapdesk you have ever purchased for your child.  a better use of your money would be to purchase an actual lap desk, drawing paper, and washable markers.  my daughter is nearly two and she loves to draw.  typically, i put her in her highchair with some drawing paper and her washable markers and let her have at it.  i thought this would give her the opportunity to relax elsewhere and draw without me having to worry about the mess if she decided to decorate the furniture or something.  this, however, would not prove to be the item which would accomplish this goal.when i unpacked the desk, i decided to give it a go myself to see how it worked.  i was horribly disappointed.  i could barely see the faintest of marks on the board.  i wrote some words and challenged my husband to read them to me and he couldn't make out what i had written.  it was honestly that bad.  i thought maybe the board needed a bit of cleaning first, so i used the little solution and gave it a once-over, but that did nothing to help.  i have no idea how you are supposed to clean it once the solution runs out because i didn't see any refills.my daughter was bored within seconds.  once she saw that the markers left no mark, she asked for her other markers, so i set her up with her usual set.  i tried looking online for a different set of markers, thinking that perhaps i just had a set that was old or defective, but i cannot find another set.  i guess that when the markers and the cleaning fluid run out you are supposed to just plunk down a lot more cash for a new lap desk.  not gonna happen.so for now i just stashed this in our storage area and once she is mature enough to handle drawing on her own without constant supervision, i will let her use it as just a lap desk.  i could accomplish that for far less than the asking price of this toy.  i expect better of crayola and hope that they either remove this product from the market or do a big overhaul on it so that it actually works.",Negative,Negative,0.9626944

"i picked this up for my son thinking i'd give it to him for his birthday.  then, i read some reviews and decided i probably should check it out before giving it as a gift.  i'm glad i did.  this item is junk.1. the markers are difficult to get out of the storage location even for an adult.2. when you color with them, you can't see what you've drawn!  what's the point?  not to mention, just in regular use, half of the very light color rubs off as the child's hand or arm touches the area where s/he just drew.3. it's advertised for small children and long car rides, but then you're warned not to let the markers touch surfaces that can't be washed.  sorry, i'm not taking the chance of one of these markers getting dropped on my leather vehicle seats and discoloring them.  (we had issues with color wonder markers leaving stains so i learned my lesson with markers that ""only mark on the special surface"".)4. since the back is hard, it doesn't even work well as a lap desk.  lap desks usually have some sort of beanbag type of back that will conform to the shape of the child's legs and stay in place.  this item is just hard plastic and stays in place no better than using a hardback book on the lap.so, this will be one of those items where it's played with for a day or two (i've already given it to him, just not as a birthday gift and he's already bored with it since it doesn't really work), will get tossed in the garage, and then eventually in the trash.  save your money.",Negative,Negative,0.9737863
"i was very excited to get this for my grandson so that he could entertain himself in the car or out at dinner without making a mess or requiring a bunch of different items that we would have the potential to lose or misplace. the drawing desk comes with four color markers (yellow, green, orange and hot pink), a wipe cloth, and an erasing sponge. the sponge and markers fit nicely into holder on the back of the desk but there is nowhere to store the wipe cloth. if your 3-year-old is anything like my grandson, it is certain that the wipe cloth is going to be misplaced or lost within a matter of days.my biggest complaint is the quality of the markers. what a disappointment. the colors are so faint that you can hardly see them. it's terrible. you are trying to draw or write and the color hardly shows up. my grandson has found more entertainment value out of using the erasing sponge. i have tried everything i can think of to get the colors to appear more vibrant but have had no success. my grandson keeps asking why the colors don't show up and gets frustrated with the process of trying to color and not seeing anything. if i had paid for this product i would return it immediately. not worth the money. i gave it two stars only because i like the overall concept of the item. with all of its history and expertise in the production of color, you'd think crayola could make a marker with vivid color that would show beautifully on this special lap top.i have considered using washable markers or dry erase markers that i have for a white board but haven't done so yet because i am afraid of ruining the writing desk. but i am going to give it a try because it's not of much value as is.",Negative,Negative,0.7294894

"i gotta be honest, here, i really hate this toy.  i am a patient person, very patient.  but this thing drove me bat-crazy by the time my 7-year-old and i were done with it.you've seen the other reviews, and the product description.  ""morphix"", a gritty playdo substance, is pressed into various molds to build castles, knights and other items.  you use the provided playmat to stage your battle, and use this plastic catapult to lob morphix globs at your enemy's fortress.for me, almost everything about this process was frustrating, until the apocalypse we unleashed at the end. you see, after a good hour of castle-building we couldn't really succeed in knocking down each other's castle, even with a number of direct hits. i asked my son what his favorite part of the toy was and he said ""throwing my castle at your castle to knock it apart.""here are a few bullet points of frustration:-the instructions are minimal. we spent most of the first 15 minutes trying to figure out why the morphix was stuck in the molds, we couldn't get them out, despite vigorous banging on the play mat (which put dozens of little dents in it).  couldn't they give some tips on this and other related subjects?-the morphix itself is weird, and even after extensive kneading, still shed some of its sand/grit, which ultimately required a vacuum at clean up.-once you've made your shape and gotten it out, there's about an 85% chance it's going to get squished in some way within moments of getting it out of the mold.-the catapults will only toss something that's within a mm or two of an exact size, so stock up on ammo, and re-shape it frequently-you can't use the catapult with 1 finger like in the picture on the instructions.  you need both hands.-the morphix doesn't hold together after an hour or two, with handling pieces start to flake off.-there's no easy way to get the packaging back together after you're done with it.  it took both of us and a houdini-like flourish to get it all in there.... then a few minutes later when we found a morphix catapult bomb a few feet away, we both decided just to throw it out rather than risk having to pick everything up again.there would be so many ways to improve this toy.  i look forward to having my son play this w/ a friend of his and see how that goes.  i set the ""educational value"" to 3 stars, 2.8 of which are the educational value of how to deal with frustration.  overall 2.5 stars, an average of 4 from him and 1 from me.  time will tell, though, how often he/we come back to this toy.  right now i'm feeling like we keep the catapults and toss everything else.if i have anything to add upon future blissful playtimes with ""create2destroy"" i will.update 10/17:  it's been over 2 months since we played with this toy, and although i've left it prominently displayed several times, my child hasn't once asked to play with it again!",Negative,Negative,0.9308839
"with a name like ""create to destroy"", i thought surely my grandsons would go nuts.  however, as soon as i saw it was not furniture friendly, i decided this was a really nice outdoor toy.  so that solved that problem, but there were others.  the blocks that were supposed to create the walls were tiny, and not fun to knock over, since they were basically only a few inches tall.  the picture on the box was very deceptive there.  you would need much more clay to make a ""fortress"" of any decent size.  while the kids did get some play value out of this, they have not wanted to play with it again.  this toy is inexpensive, but you dont get much for your money.",Negative,Negative,0.89909756
"this is basically scratchy play-doh - 1 tub each of blue, gray, and red.  there are also molds to make bricks for a fort, catapult balls, and soldiers, some plastic catapults to shoot the balls at the other side's bricks and soldiers, and a battlefield mat.it's a cool idea, but the execution is underwhelming.  the box makes it look like you can build giant structures, but there's only enough dough for several small bricks and a few accessories.  after struggling to make the various pieces, then trying to get them out of the molds, you basically end up with the world's tiniest, most tedious snowball fight.  not recommended.",Negative,Negative,0.9925176
"crayola create 2 destroy fortress looks really cool on the box; unfortunately, reality doesn't live up to the picture portrayed.  the molds are extremely cheap and the ""dough"" is rough and scratches easily.  it's interesting that the box notes that it can mar counter tops, floors, etc. but no where in the description online do i read this warning.  it is strictly for outdoor play.  the mold to make the catapult bombs didn't work well and we had to pull the stuff out and mold the item by hand.  the catapult did work but you had to use both hands unlike the one finger shown in the picture on the box sleeve.  the ""play mat"" for this set is actually the cardboard sleeve unfolded - we thought we were missing the playmat until we realized just how cheap the company had constructed both the box and the play mat.  for the price, i would have expected more of this set.in the end, i would not buy this or any other morphix product in the future.",Negative,Negative,0.9975684
"i like the overall concept of this toy which allows kids to endlessly create structures to destroy. however, everything about the toy just feels cheaply done.the toy doesn't even come in a real box, but rather a taped cardboard sleeve. this means there is no place to store the toy when you are done playing with it. you will want to get your own storage container to keep the many components in one place.as soon as i pulled the toy out of the packaging sleeve, the thin, plastic, clay containers fell on the floor and broke.the playmat is made of thin cardboard which won't lay flat well which is sort of important if you are trying to balance a structure on it. you are better off just not using the playmat and building on a table surface.the catapults are made of decent quality plastic. however, the molds are made of thin, flimsy plastic that will get distorted easily.the manufacturer states the toy is appropriate for ages 4+ but i think that is too young for most kids. i think it is better suited for much older kids maybe around 8 years old and older. you need a more mature kid to have the patience to build the fortress, not mix up the different colored clay, be gentle enough not to break the molds, and clean enough to pick up all the clay and put the many components away.i really like the concept of this toy which allows kids to be creative and build disposable structures. if they came out with a premium version with quality components, it could be great.",Negative,Negative,0.918438
"just like my review for the dino destruction mayhem item.... this item confuses me as well.  the &#34;clay&#34; that you have to put into the molds is a strange mixture and it doesn't come out of the molds, you have to twist the molds and squish them just to get the stuff out, so then it loses it shape of whatever it was supposed to be and some of it is still stuck inside the mold.  the &#34;launching&#34; of the &#34;boulders&#34; doesn't work because the clay stuff didn't really dry so it was just a lump of stuff.  my son didn't like this one either.",Negative,Negative,0.9983133
"my oldest one said, ""this is no fun."" that's a first. until now all toys were fun.the benefit of this toy is that it includes 3 medium size round containers of a fun-to-manipulate clay-like substance.the demerits of this toy include the fact that it's not like the illustrations on the box. the board is really a relatively small section of cardboard. it looks and feels cheap. the castle(s) cannot be built because the material to do so is the clay substance and there's not nearly enough of it for that purpose.i felt that the molds were not that serviceable because it's unlikely children like mine will use them more than once.finally, the catapults shoot the clay all over and cannot really be used to shoot at such close range. the balls of clay then can potentially become a mess. mainly the gap between the box illustration and the contents was too large.",Negative,Negative,0.8904686
"my grandson, approaching five years old, was the target for this toy.  but when we opened the package we were quickly disappointed.  the contents didn't look like the items in the front cover: two boys catapulting items to each other behind a high wall.  it's better suited for small action figures and the children sit behind a low table with the blocks as a sort of fortress wall, albeit not very tall.the cardboard mat doesn't sit securely on the table surface, yet because the clay material leaves residue on coffee tables (a sticky, cloudy seal), this is not recommended for indoor play on or near nice furniture.  the pieces are too small for outdoor use as well.my grandson tried this out for a few minutes and then lost interest, telling me ""it's boring, oma!""  what a shame as he loves other playdough products more suited for young boys.",Negative,Negative,0.98991615
"let me start with a positive. i like the feel of morphix better than play-dough. it has this neat gritty texture. it feels like a foam more than a dough. it will be damaging to the surfaces of your tables. so, as a stand along toy, the morphix is a lot of fun.i was a little confused about how to use this play set. when the compound was still wet, it was hard to get out of the molds. impossible, really. so if you want to create the pieces, you have to let the morphix completely dry in the molds. (and even then, they are not so easy to remove.) so now, you have dry morphix that can't be remolded and is eternally stuck in these molded shapes. hard dry blocks that are not nearly as good as legos. that's what you've got.",Negative,Negative,0.9890555
"if i could have actually built this set, it might have been fun.  even then, though, i really question its concept.  the problem is with the clay.  it's not simple play-doh, but rather it's gritty like sand is mixed into it.  it says not to get it on furniture and the like because it can scratch the finish.so the concept is that it provides molds to make two different fortresses, then battle it out using the catapults.  you get three colors of clay, the molds, and the box doubles as a play mat.  the clay is supposed to harden, but it never hardens fully.  add to that two additional problems: the molds stick to the clay and don't release it.  the molds are really durable and heavy duty, but this means you can't bend or twist them well to release the clay.  therefore, i couldn't get the pieces out without destroying them.that was a real disappointment after waiting overnight and then some.  this is where the overall concept is flawed.  most kids won't want to fill the molds, then wait multiple hours as it instructs.  it says not to add water to try and re-hydrate the clay, so i'm assuming that if pieces break, crumble or get lost, you'll need to buy additional clay instead of adding some water and re-forming.between the clay not coming out of the molds in one piece, not being able to try and reuse it, and the fact that your kids will be shocked to learn they are expected to put everything in the molds then wait a few hours before playing, i don't recommend this product.",Negative,Negative,0.9175838

"this set was not as much fun as anticipated. getting the dough in the molds is easy, getting them out is another story. if you want them to dry, you have to wait days.. if you try to take them out before they are dry, they do not come out in the shapes.. they pull apart. there is no easy way to get them out. you'd be better off to just make shapes and pieces with your hands and skip the molds all together.the playing surface is jut cardboard. the dino toy is rather small. the shapes that the molds make are very small, which lends to them being so difficult to remove.i think you could have just as much fun, if not more fun, with any other clay/dough and some action figures or toy dinosaurs etc. this set is too much of a hassle and just not worth it in my opinion.the dough itself is fairly unique though. it is very gritty and the texture is very appealing to kids to squish around in their hands. it is more fun just to &#34;mess around with&#34; and experience the feeling of it, than to play with it as intended with the whole set.",Negative,Negative,0.9479993

"crayola's create 2 destroy dino destruction stomping mall takes a great idea and fails to deliver on it.  this arts and crafts project comes with two tubs (red and blue) of putty that feels like wet stand but sticks to itself and not to anything else.  when i first opened the putty and we started playing with it, i was impressed.  the idea is to take the putty and squish it into the provided molds to make small cars, buildings and other objects so that your included dinosaur (looks like a stegosaurus with a tail that can flick balls of putty that you can mold inside the dinosaur's shell) will be able to destroy them later.  the problem is that the putty takes forever to dry.  the larger molds will take a few days to dry through depending on humidity.  if you take the putty out before it is completely dry, you'll end up with garbage.  obviously, if you choose to then destroy your creations, you'll run out of putty.  the putty is not very easy to work with in general and it is fairly difficult to make anything out of it with or without the molds.",Negative,Negative,0.94858986
"there is not a lot that is positive that i can say about this toy, from concept to execution.  granted kids will sometimes gleefully destroy their creations, or their sibling's creations ;) however other sets we have from lego, tinkertoys, lincoln logs focus on building, creation and imagination, not destruction.this set offers a bit of that, as kids make buildings, cars. there is not as much imagination involved, as they are using molds which are complete buildings and cars.included in the set are 2 colors of modeling compound (red and blue), some plastic molds, a molded plastic dinosaur catapult and coated play surface.  none of it is done well, starting with the box which is not recloseable and needs to be taken apart to open the set.  there is no way to put it away again.the modeling compound is gritty, has an interesting texture.  it has to be kneaded  and then pressed into the molds.  it is very difficult to get out again(without ruining the model), and does not come with a tool, unlike the playdoh fun factory  the clay has to dry for 24 hours to harden, at which point the little modeled rocks thrown weakly at it are supposed t destroy those buildings?  it doesn't work, nor does the catapult.  since i am discussing the clay, nowhere did i see the word non-toxic.  i would not buy this for young children.  additionally, the instructions caution that it may stain household surfaces.  really, this is about the worst modelling compound i have seen in a set for children!the molds are hard, not flexible plastic, which is what makes removal of the clay (either hard or soft) so difficult.probably the highlight of the set is the dinosaur, which is relatively sturdy.  the catapult, however, is not much of anything.finally, there is the play surface, laminated cardboard with a street and parking lot, boxes for where buildings go.  it is nether sturdy, nor something which encourages imaginative play.the set may serve well to help parents vent holiday  shopping stress, if you can find a way to actually destroy the buildings (and not house-hold surfaces).",Negative,Positive,0.4887487

"my daughter loves her larger dry erase board, and i ended up getting her this for entertainment for when she's in the car. unfortunately, i missed the writing on the bottom that mentioned 'crayons'... this is not a true 'dry erase' board which is used with markers... this is simply crayons on plastic.first, out of the box, the size is very disappointing. the 'product dimensions' listed above is for the entire box, not the toy. the board itself is is only 11"" x 9"", with the actual drawing space measuring 9"" x 7""... smaller then a standard piece of paper. the drawing area is also recessed 3/4"", making it difficult to draw comfortably. the board includes a piece of clear plexiglass that serves as the main drawing surface, and a reversible board with a black side and a white side that can be drawn on as well. both are removable, and even when inserted correctly, moves quite a bit, causing additional issues when drawing on.drawing on the colored reversible board, then inserting it into the frame behind the plexiglass and drawing on the plexiglass is suppose to give a dimensional effect, but it really doesn't... even the lighting, with its three modes of full-on, blinking, and fading on/off doesn't provide the lighted 'neon' effect that the toy implies.the colors, when the light is on, look way too similar on the black background. the light tends to make everything look blueish and the drawings look no where near as vivid as shown on the box.lastly, erasing the board takes some scrubbing... my daughter can't do it very well herself, so my it must be done by me or my wife.overall, this toy fails on just about every level... nothing works as i expected it to. my daughter still enjoys using it from time to time, which is why i went with 2-stars rather then 1, but it's nothing like what i expected and is obscenely overpriced.",Negative,Negative,0.9676819

"the crayons are the best part about this toy - they are durable, bright colors.  the concept of the dry erase light-up board in an innovative one, but the execution isn't so great.  the product is made from flimsy plastic.  my boys enjoyed drawing on it a couple of times and then watching it glow in the dark, but the novelty quickly faded when it took quite a bit of work to get the crayon off of the plastic in order to draw something new  - it takes some significant scrubbing to clean it and start fresh (not something little kids can do by themselves, it requires an adult to do the cleaning and scrubbing).  it's substantially overpriced! overall, it still needs some work.",Negative,Negative,0.94378495
"first of all, the title of this product is misleading. it uses crayons. it's not dry erase in the sense most people think of, with markers.where should i start with things i disliked most about this product? the plastic frame is so cheaply made; it feels like it will break or fall apart if it's dropped or the screen pressed on too hard. and that's just with me using it, not a child who's moderately hard on toys. really, it feels like $0.10 worth of plastic is all crayola used. terrible construction. if it wasn't a vine product, i'd send it back.the crayons aren't that easy to erase. after drawing on it a few times, my 7-year-old son gave up because erasing it took too much effort, and i have to agree. after using the screen heavily, the crayons leave a film behind, which makes it look cruddy -- especially in its glow-mode. since i assume the crayons are specially designed for this product, should you lose them, the toy is useless.the backlit ""glow"" leaves something to be desired. it uses two small lights on the bottom left and right of the frame. the glow effect is decent, except for dark a triangular void between the lights at the bottom. it really needed a third light in the middle. the lights have three modes: normal, slow fade, and flashing. in my opinion, it's too little to make up for its lack of quality.i cannot recommend this toy. for a reusable drawing board, get your child a magnadoodle. a pad of paper and crayons/markers/colored pencils works too, and it's far less expensive than this disaster.",Negative,Negative,0.9957131
"the concept is great, a dry erase surface to create art with crayons so it doesn't make all the mess of a marker board.  the board is white on one side and black on the other, the crayons write well on the board itself and cleans up easily with the erasing cloth.the board goes into a frame where you draw on a clear surface on top of the board and it lights up with color change effects and looks pretty cool.  light effects look much better in the dark.  this fun stuff is not all fun though, the board does not go into the frame all that easily and it is not secured in any way once you do get it lined up properly.  the instructions tell you to color directly on the clear surface to use the light effects, the problem is that it's really tough to get the crayon off with the cloth when you're done.you think of a dry erase surface as wiping easily, this one you have to scrub and don't plan on young kids being able to wipe it off themselves.  the idea i really liked but the end result was overall disappointing.",Negative,Negative,0.9937079

"crayola has the sort of elementary nostalgic branding that recalls first boxes of crayons.  it is a successful brand that spans generations, and that typically be counted on to both encourage and entertain.  so why they would slap the crayola brand on this dud, i can't even speculate.  the crayola light up dry erase set, is a dry erase board that is backlit. it also includes eight crayons.  here's some of the issues my eight year old and i identified with this toy:-the dry erase crayons are hard to erase.  it takes some effort! even once done, some traces remain permanently. although it preserves your drawing longer, it defeats the purpose of a draw erase board.-complicated.  my kid is fairly intuitive and builds lego toys and models and assembles her own toys most often.  yet she needs assistance setting up this toy.  there are a lot of pieces involved in the set up and you have to align the thing just so to switch backgrounds (from black to white).-4 aa batteries, required, not included.  batteries should be included on all toys period.  no problem replacing, big problem obtaining 4 batteries to even to begin to use the toy.-inferior quality.  the frame is cheap flimsy plastic and the white board itself is cardboard.-the sizing is off.  the crayons are jumbo and the screen is smaller than a sheet of paper, so you can't really do much more than doodle.  smaller crayons (orthin markers) or a larger board would have been better.-not a lot of fun.  this one is subjective, but my child spent more time setting up the board then actually playing with it.in the end, your doodle does look kind of cool once backlit, but my kid and i agree, it isn't worth the effort.",Negative,Negative,0.9698585

"it's barely an ok set. you would be better off buying your own clay and just rolling the beads yourself. it would be cheaper and you would get much more clay and colors. 4 small foil packs of clay are included. the glitter paint that is included in this set smells strongly of ammonia. my daughter pointed that out to me right away. she said it smells like glass cleaner, but it was the ammonia smell that she was referring to. you could substitute glitter nail polishes instead, if you'd like, if you decide to buy your own supplies instead of this kit.the clay takes a long time to dry and the finished products aren't very cute and look extremely juvenile. this is definitely a set for the younger girls.the press/roller gadget is smaller than you'd think and doesn't do very much at all. it would be quicker and easier to roll out dough with a small rolling pin, which could be picked up for a dollar. the device does not do anything except roll out the dough flat.the picks to poke through the beads to let them dry and add the hole for the string/ribbon are about the most useful part of the set, but again, you could definitely substitute with something else..wooden kabob skewers for example.of course this set is more cute and colorful than just buying all of your own supplies and makes for a better presentation in terms of gift giving. i would say the younger girls (ages 4-8 maybe) would be the most satisfied with it. the color, designs and types of beads that this set makes have a really &#34;young&#34; look to them. an older girl would not actually want to wear them, and i don't think they would have much fun creating the jewelry with just the items that are included in this set. i really feel like this would appeal more to 4 - 6 year olds, actually.the charms/pendants that are included look really cheap and cheesey. all you really do with them is stick clay in the inlaid part - there's not much more you can do. there are little studs then that you can poke into the center and they stay raised away from the pendant and clay.this set is really a let down and is way over priced. i feel bad to give it just one star, so i gave it two because i am sure it will appeal to someone out there, and it seems to be of good quality, but honestly i would have to recommend to pass on this unless you're buying for a little girl in the 4-6 year old range. i cannot see an older child being interested in it or liking the finished products.",Negative,Negative,0.992568

"let me start out by saying i am of the shrinky-dink generation - and puffy paint - and paper mache masks using white glue and newspapers (or globes using a balloon if you want to get fancy). i would like to believe that i am somewhat able to succeed at a kid craft especially when under the direction of a cool-under pressure able-to-whittle 9 year old, but i failed at this - mostly because i found it frustrating. the offspring persevered and was rewarded with some color swirl blobs pierced through the center and placed on the peacock stand alongside my puce colored beauties. they had lovely puce color variations within though.getting started:1) the peacock stand was assembled by the offspring in about 45 seconds sans instructions. it was simple and keeps the bead holes open while they dry. i have no complaints about the peacock stand aside from the fact it is now adorning my dining room buffet alongside her mantids and their required fruit flies. so yes, keep in mind this requires drying and space for drying...and may end up living in space you did not intend to populate with kid stuff.2) the roller apparatus is preassembled. we were up and running in under 5 minutes. we are girls who appreciate instant gratification and were happy with unpacking and mostly lack of extra packing materials (although i wish they used reclosable bags for the supplies)3) kit components include pink, blue, yellow, and purple clay, some pendant holders, clay punches, a device for hole poking, plastic clunky bracelet clasps, elastic and string (i am not clearly not employed in marketing).4) the instructions are... minimal... and clearly supposed to be written for the offspring's benefit (about a 3rd grade reading level, laid out fairly nicely) except they bounce around a lot (e.g. if you are making a swirl bead do steps 1-2 for regular beads, then swirl, then repeat steps 3-4...) - flattening position versus rolling position could have used a picture for the younger crowd. no instructions for round (obvious) and square (obvious enough for us, but maybe not for a younger child?) beads. a couple ok project ideas.5) i like the clay. it is vibrant and soft; it is not so messy or crumbly (just be aware of the ""may permanently stain!"" warning when choosing location).making stuff:1) we decided by committee that the pendants were clunky. most of this decision arrived from why do you have to flatten with the roller then smoosh it in the pendant holder. pointless - and clunky. we did not like clunky. however, these are easy enough to make, but remember there are only a few.2) onto beads: 1) choose 2 colors 2) use hole in crank arm of roller to size the pieces 3) roll the pieces and align them 4) turn roller to standing position 5) insert clay in back and crank away from you 6) put roller flat 7) put flattened clay in back and roll out - in theory the flattened piece will hit the bottom roller, push against it and coil.... which brings us to 8) take flattened coil out, repeat 7, repeat 8...  9) eventually put pressure on bottom roller have some success albeit with now puce clay 10) realize pressure did not work and manually start coils 11) realize it was easier (and less error/offset coils) to just roll by hand. 12) punch hole (no problems here but hole is big)  and 13) add to peacock rack to dry3) embossing clay: there are pretty designs lightly etched on the sides of the roller apparatus. according to the instructions you can use this to emboss your coils. however... they are so subtle that no matter how we tried the result in the clay was faint as to hardly see and then was marred as soon as we touched it. it could be there is a magic time during the hardening process that you can properly emboss the clay without cracking it using too much force. however, if this was meant for embossing the design should have been more prominent.6) glazing: subtle sheen and glitter. no problems - it is drippy so plan accordingly. the peacock holder was helpful for glazing. clear nail polish with added glitter i think would be cool to try.bottom line: i think there few supplies included for what you actually get - although i was for whatever reason enamored with the stand (it did not tip over and it actually worked). this is more of a ""getting started"" pack, but i could easily see a crafter using these up in one sitting. i found the coiling frustrating using the roller. the roller is good for flattening. i asked the offspring what she thought and she said it was fun to do with me but she thought it was kind of dumb and not anything she would wear (so maybe 9 too old?). she did not think this would be a good gift for her friends or her younger cousin (6). she thought her younger cousin would not be able to follow the directions and would not be able to roll the beads. maybe so. maybe not. ymmv. so for us, this was not a win as a rolling pin, toothpick, and better jewelry supplies would have gotten better results for less money. it is not worth the current list price. so, bottom line - no i would not recommend this unless the roller is modified so that it can grab clay better and has deeper embossing indentations. then...maybe for the 4-7 crowd.",Negative,Negative,0.86174035

"as a marketing professional, i bring a critical perspective to products that others might see in a much simpler light.  take a crayon case, for example.  crayola, the king of crayons, thought consumers would love a case to hold 152 crayons.  i thought my kids would love it, too.  after receiving it and trying it out, i cannot help but think of all the cool things this case could have been, rather than just a yellow hunk of plastic that holds crayons.i normally like to point out all the great things about products, but this is an exception.  other than holding 152 crayons, this case really does not offer much.  instead, i will focus on all the things you will not find with this product, that would have been really neat.things i wish this case offered, but it does not:1. spinning/carousel base: it is impossible for a little one to see all the crayons that are arranged to face 4 different directions around the center of the case.  so, why not make the case rotate, rather than making the kid walk around it or pick up the entire case?2. grouping/organization: rather than 152 colors dispersed somewhat randomly, why not use the case to help bring some sort of organization to the colors?  for instance, there is one box that is full of metallics.  there is another box full of glitter crayons.  however, the only way i knew this was by pulling out the individual crayons and using deductive reasoning.  why not label the groups and do more groups to help make sense of such a large assortment?3. a lid with a clasp: there is a very cheap plastic lid with this case that i am certain will be discarded by most purchasers who think it is simply packing material--not worthy of keeping for the long haul.  however, if you don't keep that cheap piece of plastic, then you have no lid at all.  it would have been nice if they had thought about a case of crayons that will almost certainly be transported by a little one who might drop it.4. cooler sharpener: this case has a sharpener, but it is inconveniently located in the middle of the case, and it is sunken down low.  it really isn't even all that easy to see.  then, to sharpen a crayon, a kid must hold the crayon vertically and turn it.  sure, all of this is possible, but with a big case like this, a better solution could have been designed that is easier to access and use.5. refill friendly design: my kids use washable crayons, which do not come with this case.  however, the only way that i could put their crayons into this case would be to buy 16-count boxes of crayons, as this case is really only designed to hold that size of box (actually, there is one box in the case that holds 24, but the rest hold 16 crayons).  practically speaking, the life of this case is going to be pretty short if it is not easy to refill with one's own crayons down the road.in summary, if you are just looking for a throw-away plastic case full of 152 crayons, then this product is for you.  if, on the other hand, you are hoping for a case that is designed to stand the test of time and provide some unique and useful features and benefits for your little ones, you'll be disappointed like me.",Negative,Negative,0.82495326

"this is yet another crayola review i write, with two kids and the older (6 years old) being a huge crayola fan, this should not come as a surprise. how does this product perform then?for starters, the selling point is that this is designed for small hands and it is also mentioned this is supposed to be ""mess-free"". well, the size of the pad is just about perfect for a toddler, but it did feel just about right for my older kid (6)how does this work? after installing three aa batteries (not included, so keep that in mind if you get this) you should be good to go. on the back of the pad there is an on/off switch where you can select if you want color lights or color lights with music. just to give you an idea we do not use the music at all, it is just too loud and there is no volume control to change that, also, like with any other similar toys, it gets repetitive and eventually, annoying.the way this is built so it is mess-free, is that the pad is made of a dark blue gel covered by a thin plastic layer, so by using the included stylus you basically draw by removing the gel. this is very practical and clean but as you can imagine, frustrating: since the pad is made out of gel, it is practically impossible to draw without the figures deforming. also, once you've used it, there is no easy way to restore the gel completely. you have to manually spread the gel, making all kinds of shapes with your hands in the process.after watching my kids play with this for a while i came to the following conclusion: younger kids (1-2 years old) may feel drawn to the music and colors but not actually use it as intended. older kids who could use it to actually draw things may end up frustrated because of the issues caused by the consistency of the gel on the screen. i guess what i am trying to say is that this may work better as a baby toy, but there are better baby toys out there than this one.i am giving this item two stars, but i will also say there are other crayola products you can get on the same price range that may suit your needs better.one final comment, anyone else noticed how amazon warns about the choking hazard and mentions this is not for kids under 3? i mention this because the box in which this comes has a huge sign on the front suggesting this for 24+ months kids. the only choking hazard i could find was the stylus and yeah, i put the thing away from my younger kid.",Negative,Negative,0.9614383
"the pictures on the box show children who have supposedly successfully drawn pictures on the color pad.  and those pictures are clear, vibrant, and stay long enough for a photographer to snap a picture.there is only one explanation...those children are wizards!my own, perfectly normal, non-magical child couldn't draw a clear picture on this thing to save her life.  immediately upon using either the included stylus, her fingers, or any other thing around the house that we tried to draw with, we noticed that most of the time it is impossible to even draw a clear line - and in most cases, the gel refills any lines immediately.  however, being an industrious child, she immediately grabbed some markers and decorated the boring white frame that surrounds the gel pad.i imagine that an infant might be fascinated by the texture, the lights, and the music.  and an infant can't draw anything anyway, so wouldn't be disappointed if their drawing suddenly disappeared or never appeared at all.however, if you have a child who likes to draw and likes to actually see their drawings stay in place for more than a split second, you will likely have a child who is very disappointed with this product.however, if your child is either an infant or a wizard (or an infant wizard!!!), you may enjoy this one.* two stars simply for use by infants (or wizards).",Negative,Negative,0.99126875

"the top surface of this toy is smooth. there's no way to see or feel where the 'buttons' are to activate various features. granted, it's pretty forgiving. you can tap anywhere on the animals, anywhere on the keys, to make sounds. but after a few seconds of watching a kid trying to tap the light next to the drum kit instead of the drum kit itself, even i was frustrated.as with most leapfrog toys, the voices are shrill and it defaults to being noisy and pestering. with a few taps, you can make it quiet so your child can explore the different musical notes and sounds, but unless you do, it's just an endless loop of noise.there are three modes, 'compose', 'song', and 'game'.compose is a sort of free-for-all. it starts with the 'guitar' loop playing, and kids can bang on the keys or the animals-with-instruments to add more noise.song encourages kids to touch the different instruments to hear little samples of sound, or they can touch an animal-with-instrument to play a song. (now this would have been a great opportunity to actually teach something. if, for example, the keys lit up to show which note was being played in the song. but no, it just plays a song like 'twinkle twinkle'.)game involves the device telling the user to touch a certain color. there are pretty much only two options - the key of that color, or the animal/instrument of that color. the device then tells the kid what they touched (the key color, the animal name, the instrument), and starts again. given that there are only 8 keys, 6 animals, and 4 instruments, the options are limited.there's pretty much nothing this toy does that isn't done by every other toy on the market these days. hit a button, hear a song. the only interesting education option, using the playing song to teach a little basic keyboarding, isn't one of the features.and in a bid to lighten the toy or lower the cost by reducing the material requirements, the back of the toy is mostly empty space with thin plastic bands for structural support. while not actually sharp, they do dig into a kid's lap if they're wearing shorts instead of long pants. i'll post a picture of this (the toy, not the red lines of my child's legs after using it).if you want your kid to experiment with music, get them a keyboard. there are some pretty cheap, pretty good ones on the market these days that actually do teach kids how to play some simple songs. if you just want more noise in your life, this one'll do.",Negative,Negative,0.9072086

"my daughter lives for music.  at the slightest hint of a song anywhere, on screen, in the car, off the ipad, she's up and dancing and singing.  any toy of hers that makes music is never far, except this one.  she played with it for about 15 minutes, and hasn't looked at it again.  i think a few factors may be the cause:1.  its not intuitive - its a flat panel toy, and different parts of the surface produce music when pressed.  the only hint that a given surface produces music is the graphics on the panel.  unlike most music-making toys that have graphic and a 3 dimensional design to indicate an engaging surface, there's not much to direct the player's attention.  yes, the graphics are quite cute, but there was no tactile response that involved my daughter (unlike pressing a button).  i suppose this is a bit surprising, given her ipad (practically glued to her) doens't have a tactile response either, but it doesn't work for her.2.  sound quality - is awful.  the embedded speaker is very low quality, and the sounds are muffled, with little audio fidelity.  i'm not expecting ipad-like sound quality (itself not great, but light years ahead of this one, albeit at orders of magnitude more cost), but the sound was so weak that it was hard to discern the different instruments.3.  my daughter is 3, which is the beginning of the recommended age range for the product.  it didnt hold her interest at all, but it makes me wonder whether they should revise the range down.  perhaps its more simple design would better appeal to a 2 y/o or so.",Negative,Negative,0.9966042

"there's a lot to like about leapfrog's ""read with me, scout"", but you'll quickly discover that scout is no replacement for reading a book with your little one in your lap.  this is true for parents and (more importantly) the kiddos.scout's got a lot of tech crammed into him, much more than your average squeezable, interactive plush toy.  set up is a snap (we had scout unboxed with the help of a scissors in less than 3 minutes).  you begin by pressing a color coded button on scout's collar that corresponds to the cover the chosen book.  he's got a pleasant (but somewhat on the loud side) voice that sings songs, giggles when hugged, asks your child questions that relate to the story being read (e.g.: ""do you feel happy or sad?  when you feel grumpy, what helps you feel better?""), and of course reads one of five stories.  you can pat scout on the head to move along with the story or follow one of his other instructions (e.g.: ""pat my cheek to hear my elephant sound!"").the interactive portions are above average in their creativity compared to other similar products on the market.  nonetheless, you'll still get what you pay for.  this isn't a supercomputer that has infinite variability and/or artificial intelligence.  after one time through each book, the rapport starts to sound very repetitive.  kids pick up on this nearly as quickly as the adults who wish scout was in another room.  the replay value is therefore limited, which you'll soon discover after you've burned through the five short board books.the first time we played with scout, play time lasted just over 15 minutes before my 4-year-old moved on to the bubble wrap he came packed in.  (honestly, it held his attention almost as long.)  play time has diminished since to the point where scout is a nearly forgotten afterthought in our home.it's easy for me to say, since i received scout courtesy of the vine program, but i cannot recommend this highly enough:  take the money you're thinking about spending on scout, supplement your child's library with quality picture books, and enjoy some precious reading time... together.",Negative,Negative,0.93760055

"as the subject says the toy itself is nice but i preordered over a month in advance.  during that time amazon continued to show available for preorder and never made it known that they would have stock issues.  when it came out i waited over a week then contacted amazon who had it showing in stock fulfilled by amazon for other sellers but still had not shipped.  they said they couldn't tell any estimate on how long before they would get to my order or even how many outstanding preorders were still out there.  when i closed the chat utterly frustrated i ordered from the hasbro website and got it there instead.  9 minutes after i had just got off the chat with an amazon supervisor who repeatedly said amazon did not have any stock, i received an email from amazon saying it shipped.so, i waited to receive them from both places since i collect and the one that came from amazon had a slightly beat up box.  the one from hasbro came in perfect condition.  both were delivered by fedex and the outside boxes were fine so the problem appeared to be on amazon's side.while i know a lot of the complaint is more with amazon than the toy itself (which is pretty awesome) the buying experience is a big part of what makes you happy with the toy.  as a result i went from super excited about it coming out to being extremely frustrated with how the situation was handled and ultimately receiving a beat up box.",Negative,Negative,0.6527536

"disclosure: we are not a huge transformers family.  however, we've had a few here and there and my younger son loves to build things and is a pro at building things from instructions all by himself--he's constructed probably a dozen 400/500+ piece lego/k'nex, etc, projects with virtually no help.  so this is a kid who is very good at figuring out how things go and reading directions.  not this transformer!  he found the directions to this extremely confusing and the plastic difficult to move/transform.i called in an expert: my engineering-loving teenaged son who spent some time with this toy only to dismiss it as ""crap.""  (this teen has owned a number of transformers).  he commented, for example, that the shield was stuck so hard into the fist that you feel like you're going to break something simply by removing it.  he lost patience before figuring out the transformation.  so i took a turn.  i have absolutely no idea what these instructions are trying to me.  they have to be the most cryptic instructions on a construction toy i've ever seen.  i look at it and i feel like i understand what i'm supposed to do, but when i try to do it the pieces don't seem to go the way.  we've had this about a week now and we still can't make it go into a car.i had thought this would be a nice change-of-pace toy for my little 7 yo engineer, but i was really wrong.  it's too complex, too hard to physically pull out some of the pieces, and just doesn't seem like a toy for children.",Negative,Negative,0.9908194

"before you open the box, gather up 4 aa batteries and one of those tiny little phillips-head screwdrivers. one of the screws holding my battery cover in place was in so tight that it took 4 different screwdrivers and the screw head is almost completely stripped now - i won't be screwing this back in too tightly, on the off chance that the batteries may die someday.the box is much, much bigger than the pieces require, so they rattled around a lot during shipping and the &#34;stage&#34; portion is pretty scratched up. i'm sure my 5-year-old nephew won't care very much but it just seems like they're trying to make you think you're buying a much larger, more impressive toy than you actually get. inside, the smaller pieces are divided into plastic bags in a way that makes no sense whatsoever - basically you need to open every single bag before you can assemble even one portion of the final toy. the packaging engineers at playmobil need to buy a few pieces of ikea furniture and take a lot of notes about how to package in a logical, space-saving way that follows the chronology of assembly. ultimately it only took me about 55 minutes to assemble the whole thing (about 15 of which involved wrestling the battery cover), but fortunately i didn't have my nephew over my shoulder impatiently demanding to play with it sooner. so if you're getting this as a gift for someone, open 'er up and assemble it first.the light feature is pretty cool, and the fact that you can broadcast your own music through the speakers is fun. the speakers are very cheap and sound tinny, but it is a pretty inexpensive toy so what can you expect. unfortunately, kids today are accustomed to very sophisticated technology so i don't know if my nephew will find that to be a cool thing for long or not. fun idea though. it does come with two pre-loaded songs that are pretty awful, and the volume control has two settings: &#34;not that loud&#34; and &#34;slightly louder.&#34; plugging in an mp3 player, ipod, etc, is very easy through a headphone jack connection (which means you can use anything that has a headphone jack) but integrating a small holder for your ipod or phone would be a handy improvement.once assembled, the stage does look pretty cool and the instruments (especially the guitars) are great looking! the band members, not so much. as others have mentioned, they're all dudes, which is pretty outdated, and their outfits - omg. does the designer think that today's kid's love def leppard and bon jovi or what?? very dated, goofy outfits. maybe current &#34;rock bands&#34; do dress like 1980's ac/dc tribute clubs, but just in case, maybe playmobil could offer some other &#34;bands&#34; to play on your stage, even include a little keyboard or dj booth in the future. this has some potential for expansion, if your kid doesn't break it first - everything feels a little flimsy but i suppose it all depends on how hard they want to rock out.loved the idea of this, but am not too impressed with the execution.",Negative,Negative,0.95446044

"i was excited about this product because it's the perfect compliment to the disney princess songs castle that my 15 month old loves, but i quickly became disappointed with it and my daughter became very bored with it's limitations. on the positive side, the stable was relatively easy to put together and only required a screwdriver for one piece and the rest snapped together. it's made of durable plastic and is very cutely decorated and comes with 2 horses/princesses (aurora and rapunzel). my daughter does love watching the horses klip klop down the ramps, but becomes frustrated with the fact that the horses legs get stuck in the ridges of the ramp and the fact that on the ramp there's a slide and the horses get stuck in that too.there really isn't much play option value in this other than the turn table that plays music while the horses sit on it and the horses (sorta) klopping down the ramps. the box boasts of music and lights but the only music that plays is at the front door slide and on the turn table. my biggest issue with it is that it's bulky and if you want to play with the turn table, you have to turn the entire monstrosity around and if you want to play with the slide you have to turn the whole thing around again. i think the price (about $40) is way too high for the limited amount of play options and that the cost of buying one additional horse/princess is also too high ($10). yes watching the horse klop down is fun and cute for a while, but that's where the amusement ends. if you're looking for a versatile and fun disney princess product, i recommend going withfisher-price little people disney princess songs palace. this is way more fun and the princesses talk/sing and my daughter loves it. this stable toy is just not up to par.",Negative,Negative,0.9430569

"as a member of amazon vine, i chose this toy to review, but amazon screwed up and sent me the older, annoying version and that's the toy i tested and reviewed.  when i submitted my review, amazon put it on this page with the newer version of the toy.  i have contacted amazon by phone and email to no avail.  their canned email response was to simply delete my review, but if i do that i can't continue to participate in the vine program because there will be no review of the toy they sent me.  i'm sure the new toy is better because it is not battery operated and that would eliminate the annoying motor sound and the music.  here is the review i wrote about the toy they sent me.  remember, i did not choose this page to post my review, amazon placed it.  what a mess!it sounded great . . . balls popping up everywhere.  it sounded like something my 13 month old grandson would love since he loves to play ball.  the reality was much different.  first of all, it comes without batteries so be prepared with 4 ""d"" batteries. next is the noise factor.  it sounds like a small vacuum cleaner.  however, the noise did not bother my grandson at all.  after i assembled it and added the batteries, i turned it on.  the balls did not pop out everywhere.  they popped out of the same place each time.  since i had it on a hardwood floor, the balls hit the floor and immediately rolled under the furniture.  within seconds all the balls were inaccessible to my grandson.  i was the one who had to get down on the floor to retrieve the balls that were stuck under the furniture.  i don't think this would have been a problem on a carpeted floor.  however, it didn't really matter that the balls were under the furniture because the toy never engaged my grandson.  he watched it for a minute and toddled off.  my 6 year old granddaughter played with it for about 2 minutes and then she wandered off.  bottom line - i do not recommend this toy if you are looking for something that is highly engaging to a young child.",Negative,Negative,0.95275235

"my five-year-old daughter seems to prefer the smaller dolls for play, so i thought this set would be perfect for her. size-wise, it doesn't take up very much space and the castle playset comes with everything your child will need to act out stories with the barbie characters mariposa and catania. my daughter has never seen the barbie mariposa movies, and it has no impact whatsoever on her enjoyment of the playset. she has fun making up her own stories and moving the small figurines from one part of the castle to another.assembly requiredfor the most part, the set is almost fully put together when you remove it from the box. i appreciated i didn't have to attach any stickers to the playset because i can never get them as perfectly aligned and as smooth as i want. the plastic the pieces are made from is pretty thin, and it might be possible to damage it if you aren't careful when attaching them. be sure to stick to the instruction's guidelines, because most of the pieces don't come out once you snap them in.the most difficult part for me was #2 on the instruction, affixing the pink top floor to the white columns. this was easily the most frustrating part for me; everything else was mostly straightforward, though there was confusion over which small decorative piece needed to go on top of the castle so the fairies could spin. overall, it took maybe twenty or so minutes to get it all put together and the loose pieces into the castle where the box shows them.tiny piecestruly, i'm surprised to see that this toy is recommended for ages three and up. there are so many tiny pieces for children to lose, and they could easily be swallowed by a child who has a habit of putting toys in his or her mouth. if you have older children at home as well as younger ones, keep this toy far away from the younger ones! also, you might think you are missing pieces in the set, but you aren't. the instruction guide says you have to attach some pieces to the bed, but upon closer inspection those pieces were already a part of the two beds. those additional pieces are shown as separate attachments on the front of the pretty-much-useless pamphlet. perhaps the biggest disappointment is the lack of a mirror for the upstairs of the castle. the box clearly shows one, so we thought we were missing a piece and i was going to write to mattel and ask them for it. however, on the instruction guide where it shows all the pieces, no mirror is listed. i don't know if there actually is supposed to be one, or if the instruction guide is wrong about this like it is about some of the other pieces too.qualitythe dolls included with this toy are a bit lower quality than i would have liked. they are barely a step up from the little plastic barbie dolls that i've seen in the impulse-buy area at the checkout at target. we bought our daughter one of those dolls once and pieces of her neck started to break off. of course, this upset my little girl. we glued the doll back together as best we could, but eventually i think the toy was thrown away. hopefully these dolls will not suffer the same fate; i hate seeing my daughter disappointed because companies don't put much thought into the quality of their toys.tipfor the spinner at the top of the castle, the dolls fit into them by snapping their chests to the seats. if you look closely, you'll see that the ""seats"" are shaped exactly like barbie's chest area, so that's where you snap them in.overallunfortunately, this isn't a must-have toy. it was aggravating to assemble, the quality of the toy leaves plenty to be desired, and the smaller pieces will be easy to lose track of if parents or child are not attentive to them.",Negative,Negative,0.978458

"the doll looks beautiful in the box, but once removed the concept gets in the way of play. so, i wonder if this doll is meant to be left in the box as a display piece because the process to unfurl the wings, and fold down the wings is a bit clunky and awkward for a child. additionally, it creates more of a mechanical toy, like a transformer, than a doll.the backpack contraption permanently installed in the back of the doll is intrusive both visually and practically. the mechanism does not operate smoothly. and, the glitter on the wings seemed to get on everything, again causing me to think that perhaps the doll should be left in the box as a display item rather than used as an actual toy.it is clear that the intention was creative but the execution unsuccessful. it might have been preferable to just create a less high-tech, more flexible costume that included mariposa wings that could be worn by simply slipping the doll's arms through a loop at each shoulder, and when the child tired of that, remove the wings and perhaps slip on a beautiful long skirt to create the idea of a ball gown for the fairy princess.i wanted to like the doll, loved the way it looked, but the functionality simply was not there.",Negative,Negative,0.99857044

"i was taken aback when i read the other reviews. people liked it and to further the confusion, they were actually counting how many cars they could get on the track!? our counting stopped at one, after one and the cars would fall off the track, dropping like flies after attempting the very first loop.the directions were clear and the track was fairly easy to put together. assembly time: approximately 15-30 minutes, a whopping 4 d batteries were not included (surprise, surprise). the first included car was propelled at a high rate of speed along the track and maintained this. excitedly we added a second car and were immediately disappointed when it could not complete the very first loop, then both cars fell off dropping like flies. in an attempt to solve the problem we tried different things. we changed the batteries to ones right out of the package - brand spanking new, we moved the track onto a hard kitchen floor- thinking the carpet was perhaps a problem, we tried adding a book on the track base for weight (as indicated in the directions), also tried a multitude of other cars. the results were the same each time, one car worked - but two or more, no way. even the first car would fall off after a short time. disastrous. it appears as if the propulsion wheels that accelerate the cars need to be spinning at a faster rate.the only credit i can give for this track, is that the track seems to be better made than some of those out there that are thin and hard, cheaply made. it also was fun to change the cars track by pulling two levers. we did not have the necessary ipad for extended play.in conclusion, my kids were disappointed, why shouldn't they be? the box was misleading it showed 6 cars on the track racing and wreaking havoc with crashes. this track set will not be a hit at our house.",Negative,Negative,0.9865096

"*this is a disappointment.  here are four reasons.to use the lower track the set must be set on a horizontal, flat, solid, surface.  surfaces it won't work on include granite staircases (not horizontal or flat), sand, a black velvet painting of elvis, and the upper tier of the green at the 18th hole at st. andrews, which, by the way, you won't be able to use for more than about a minute anyway before all kinds of people wearing various comical forms of golfing attire come storming out of the clubhouse right straight at you and waving their arms and yelling at you to get off their precious old sod.  sheesh.  for this sincere limitation i subtract one star.oh, and it also doesn't work on carpets or rugs.*the bottom track does have a chance of working on a solid surface such as an oak floor or a tabletop that's large enough and otherwise unneeded.  other surfaces it works on include a big mirror, a sheet of lexan, the roof of a humvee, and a freshly zambonied ice skating rink, which, by the way, you won't be able to use for very long, at least not at crown center, before this sad-looking, slope-shouldered, 16-year-old comes slumping out onto the ice and tells you you can't set up your disney/pixar cars stunt racers double decker speedway there, ""not even in a corner.""  sheesh.i found the instructions to be generally impenetrable upon the first reading and barely penetrable after the third, and i ended up relying on the pictures on the box and on this very amazon description page, which shows several views of the assembled track from different vantages.  for this i subtract another star.  if you are still interested in this product, you will be pleased to learn that its assembly does not require tools such as a hammer or a cordless drill or an oxyacetylene welding torch.*the package comes with exactly one fewer than the minimum required number of cars to have a race, which according to my math is two.  the arrangement of dual starting lines and dual launch buttons and dual tracks begs the participants to race one car against another, one on the ground and the other in the air, yet no matter how hard you search amongst the contents of the box, you will not find a second car to race against the one car you do find.  to stage races one must drive to a store and spend money to get a second car or use amazon or some similar online service and spend money to get a second car.  or you could do as i have done and fabricate one yourself, which i can now tell you takes a lot more time and money than you might originally have expected.this failure is plainly stated by the manufacturer right on the box and on the amazon description page, so it's not like customers can complain they were taken completely unawares, but it is still a failure, for which i subtract another star.*one more thing is, if you don't have the added enjoyment of a race, after a pretty short time this toy becomes boring.  except for this one deal where you can alter the upper car's course into a winner's circle, it's the same routine time after time.  it's the same thing over and over, it becomes repetitive, it becomes repetitive, and it become repetitive, for which i subtract one star.*if your math is the same as mine, this baby has lost all the stars it can.*",Negative,Negative,0.77973926
"amazon has this toy rated for ages 3-10 but the box itself says it's for ages 5+. my son is 4 years old and had no trouble playing with it.to start, the toy was difficult to put together. there are so many pieces and the directions are not straightforward. worse, some of the plastic parts did not fit together well.once put together, the toy wasn't great. the car is supposed to zoom around the track but it didn't go very fast (on both the upper and lower tracks) no matter how much we cranked the handle. the upper track has portions where the car is supposed to do side wheelies. what actually happened was the car stalled and got stuck.in theory, i can see how this looks fun on the drawing board but the reality is my son played with this for several hours, then abandoned it and hasn't played with it since. and this is a boy who usually compulsively plays with track toys. so in short, save your money and skip this one.",Negative,Negative,0.97834367

"i liked the concept of this toy because it looked like it would offer my test kidlets a number of different play choices, but the reality turned out somewhat different.first of all, this toy must be played on non-carpeted surfaces.  to use the ""bottom"" level of the track, you need to have a hard surface otherwise the car won't be able to make a circuit of the inner course.  also, since the launcher is not attached to the device (so you can change the angle of entry) a hard surface is also needed to reach the upper course levels.second complaint, only one race car is provided with the toy.  it's hard to have a ""race"" when there's no one to race against, and you can't substitute any hot wheels or matchbox cars that you might have on hand.third complaint, the assembly instructions were not very clear and the letter-marks on the pieces were sometimes hard to see/find.  this isn't something that the kids can put together themselves.we never did ever get the car to run completely around the upper tracks, though it did make a nice figure-8 on the floor-level track.  we just couldn't get it to go fast enough to fully test the course.my recommendation?  save your money.  there are better toys out there.  this could have been a great toy if more time had been taken with the instructions, with the propulsion method, with the operation of the upper levels, and with the inclusion of at least two cars.  car racing sets are easy to create but few are created well.  the kidlets didn't play with this much beyond the first day, and now i just see pieces of it scattered among the rest of their toys.",Negative,Negative,0.70986164
"this track gets two stars from me because my son does think it's cool (he's almost four and likes cars,) he likes the car itself, and because we (adults) have gotten at least some of the functionality to work some of the time. however, he's never actually gotten it to work himself, so that i'm surprised he wasn't more disappointed. he's mostly ignored the track after the first 24 hours and played with just the car.putting the track together wasn't impossible, but it was a challenge and the instructions weren't all that clear. (""helpful hint"" to put on the stickers first would have been ridiculously hard.) it holds together well enough to work, but tends to start coming apart quickly if it's moved or if baby brother comes along.it was tough for me as a mom to figure out how to set up and use it; the instructions offer practically no guidance as to what it's supposed to do and how. my husband's the only one out of the three of us that's really gotten the car to loop the track. in fact, now that i look at other reviews, there are things i didn't even know it was supposed to do.one potential problem is that it has to be used on a hard, smooth surface - at the lower level the car runs on the floor rather than a track. carpet, rug or probably tile would be problematic.a final drawback i see is that it's a track to race cars, and of course only one car is included. to have a race you'll need to pick up another vehicle in the set, likedisney / pixar cars stunt racers raoul carouleit's designed to launch two cars at once, though you can do just one.amazon's description says that it's based off the movie planes. having seen cars but not planes, i really think it's based on cars; the car included is lightning mcqueen.",Negative,Negative,0.98315996
"i remember playing with matchbox cars and generic plastic tracks back in the 80s (everything was universal back in those days) and felt somewhat nostalgic when i had the opportunity to review the latest entry from the disney merchandising empire, namely the cars speedway.  course i, a 6'5 29 year old male with graying hair, would have looked really silly to my roommates trying to test this product by myself so i, as i had done with previous reviews on toys, enlisted the help of my neighbors, who have two children between the ages of 7-10 (i didn't ask, silly me) to test it out while i took notes nearby.  it didn't take long for problems to occur starting with assembly.the instructions were... well... crappy and exceedingly vague for anyone that doesn't assemble anything on a daily basis.  the mother, who is about as normal as blueberry pie (hehe, south pacific reference!), called me over within five minutes expressing frustration at what the instructions meant.  the pictures were somewhat confusing even to me, and i used to install home theaters and home appliances at best buy.  i had to violate my own prime directive of reviewing non-interference to assist the mother in construction and i quickly quipped that i certainly hope the writers of the manuals do not moonlight as 911 operators (""perform cpr by using your hands!"")even with my help, it took approximately 30 minutes to assembly what should've have been a 10-minute job and we came to an even worse realization after that.now, i'm not a parent but i've moved around enough and spent enough time at other friend's houses as a child to know that most children's rooms are carpeted.  it's a safety and comfort issue.  now, where does this fit into my review?  well, the product is basically a two-level track that starts on the bottom floor, that sits on the ground, and the cars are shot by a launcher up a ramp to the upper level or around a loop on the ground level.  problem is that the ground floor is little more than a plastic perimeter/guardrail that guides the cars and not an actual track.  also, there's a few inches of space between the launcher and the ramp to the upper level, meaning the car has to traverse across whatever surface it's sitting on (hardwood, carpet, your dad's back, etc.) before using the remaining momentum to ascend.in short, this thing does not work on carpet, ergo use in the vast majority of children's rooms.now, i was always under the impression that disney had one of the best marketing divisions in the world, and yet, they overlooked this little problem that even i, a non-parent, figured out almost immediately (hey, disney toy execs!  did i mention that i am available to hire as a full-time bonafide toy tester?  *waggles eyebrows sarcastically*).the mother and i quickly relocated the speedway, which almost fell apart in our hands as it is very flimsy, to the kitchen table after promptly evicting the father, who was trying to enjoy a quiet game of angry birds on his laptop.  after explaining the importance of testing the product to the angry father (""it's for science!"") we reassembled the tracks and were about to test it on the hard surface of the table with the kids when we ran into another problem.i handed the steve- er... lightning mcqueen car to the youngest and reached into grab another one for the other-... what the?  where's the other car?  the speedway only comes with one car and replacement cars cost... well... you can get a few matchbox cars for the same price.  this wasn't good as you can't have a race without two cars otherwise it's a time trial and this is hardly mario kart.  after a few seconds of thinking i asked the kids if they had any matchbox cars to see if they could be used as substitutes.  it was here that i found out why the cars stunt racers were so expensive; they're proprietary and have pull-back motors!  this means they are specifically designed for the track and vice versa so nothing else will work on the track as we learned very quickly.i see your tricks disney toy execs!  you clever fatherless people you!  this is how they tie you in to buy more stuff that is way overpriced and as flimsy as a bridge on the i-5!seeing how this was not going to work with two children and i was not going to travel to the nearest department store to spend money on more cars, we let the children take turns and they got bored within minutes as there was nothing more to do than turn an annoying crank and watch a single car do the same thing every time.  it became very repetitive and i can just imagine how long the flimsy power crank would last as it sounded like something from frankenstein with every passing turn.realizing that this toy would not last without a larger investment in more disney cars toys, i turned to the mother and asked a single question.me:  ""do you guys have a nintendo wii?""mother:  ""yes.""me:  ""mario kart?""mother:  ""of course!""me:  ""i challenge all of you!""kids:  ""challenge accepted!""i lost... darn kids...all in all, this product is little more than an attempt by what i can only imagine as a bunch of pudgy, balding disney toy execs to suck you in and buy more stuff.  this toy is annoying to assemble, flimsy at best, and requires a larger investment to even begin to enjoy.  avoid.",Negative,Negative,0.92090344
"i have a son who loves the cars movies, and loves playing with cars of any sort.  so i thought this would be a good thing to try.many people complain about the assembly instructions.  i had no problems with them.  it's very clear how it goes together.others have complained about how flimsy it is, so i was expecting really flimsy.  it wasn't.  ours holds together just fine.  nothing ever came apart.so assembly was quick and easy, only took a few minutes.where it's a fail is in the performance of the toy itself.  the lower level track (only use it on hard floor, this will not work on carpet) actually lets the car do three to five laps around it.  there are simply external boundaries for the inner track that force the car to run in a figure 8 underneath the track.  that part works fine, the car just pushes against the plastic guide on the outside and that forces it to go where it should, there's no ""track"" on the bottom.  but the top track, the one that has the ""winner's circle"" and everything, is a complete disaster.  even with me cranking it as fast as it will go, the car *sometimes* can complete a single lap up there.  more often than not, the ""trick"" parts of the track screw things up and the car stops there...the winners circle part has a spring inside that snaps it into place onto the track when you decide the race is over and press on the piston cup up there.  until that point it's rotated so as to not interfere with the race.  press the piston cup, the spring rotates it into place so it can capture the car.  there's a small clear plastic piece that then pops up so the car finishes out the remainder of it's energy spinning around in it.  that part works fine, but the odds on the car having any energy left to make it that far even on the first lap are poor...if you have correctly sized cars that can sit in the ""observation area"", when the car spins in the winners circle, that makes little pieces of the track under the spectators move, so that it looks like they're moving up and down cheering.  my son would've been more impressed had they simply had a plastic piece with a sticker of people that moved up and down since at least that would work more consistently.all in all, a fail on the upper track, even if the lower track works alright.  definitely not worth the purchase.  the lower track is the only reason it even gets two stars.  if it were just the top track that was part of the race here, i would've given one star.",Negative,Negative,0.9177568
"mattel says, ""kids will love reenacting their favorite scenes from the movies."" that's pretty much true, but all the reenacting will be in your child's imagination and not on this double decker speedway.with rickety plastic construction and instructions that are miles from intuitive, it will be forty minutes before you are ready for the fun. and what fun it will be. watching your car feebly attempt to navigate the contraption over and over. on the plus side, your child will develop popeye muscles from cranking the motor incessantly.amazon's recommended age range is 3 to 7 years. the manufacturer's recommended age is 3 to 10 years, which is ridiculous. a ten-year-old does not want to play with a dinky car toy. i would say even 7 years is pushing it, if not for the sheer dexterity needed to use this toy. ultimately, you'll need two children: one to wind it up and one to hold the pieces together for some semblance of functionality, especially the winner's circle. you can't even crank sufficiently without moving the launching grid, thus negatively altering the alignment. forget about seeing ""stunts"" on the track. what a joke.the idiocy of this toy knows no bounds. the stickers, for example. the instructions include this helpful hint: ""apply labels before assembly by number as indicated."" unfortunately, the accompanying illustrations show only a fully assembled track. the individual stickers are numbered. the track pieces are lettered. there exists no alphanumeric means of matching which sticker goes on which piece, until *after* assembly is completed, contrary to the stated instructions.from all accounts, the stunt racers sets are all disasters:cars stunt racers dinoco stunt show stunt setyou can use multiple cars here but of course this set only comes with one. additional stunt racers are ten bucks each. for example,here,here, andhere. at least the car is fun, but forget about the track. just rev the car (in either direction) and place it on a hard floor on an end or a side and watch it go. just be careful: fingers can get easily caught in the spinning wheels.the images on the box are all photoshopped, no doubt because mattel's engineers couldn't get it working long enough to take an actual photograph. if i had paid even twelve bucks for this toy, it would be going back to the store.shame on you, mattel.",Negative,Negative,0.9097414
"the disney cars stunt racers double decker speedway could have been a great toy.  kids love the cars movie so a track that features a way to replicate the movie experience into a playable format should be a great hit right?  wrong!the toy proved a bit complicated to assemble though thankfully all the pieces have letters that indicate the sequence in which they fit together. once you put it together you quickly realize how poorly designed it is.  the bottom track requires a hard floor to work properly (it wont work on carpet).  the top track has a section that rarely works at all (the car always seems to get stuck).  what fun in a racetrack if the car gets stuck in the track?to make matters worse, the track only comes with one car so the dual launching start gate is totally useless unless you spend extra money on more cars. overall this had about 20 minutes of playtime for my kids before they became bored and were ready to move on to the next toy.  this is not worth the money at all.",Negative,Negative,0.99502796
"the idea of this track is that cars can run on the upper track or on a lower figure eight track. you place the car in the starting area, crank it up, and release it into the track. since there's no bottom panel, for the lower figure eight track to work at all, the toy has to be on some sort of hard surface, but it functions properly. the upper track is where we have problems. if the car is wound up enough to actually make it around the circle, it jumps the track every single time. there's a winner's circle that is completely manual. you press down a little wall to lock it in place, rotate the part out of the way, and then press a button to pop it into the way of the car so it's now routed into the circle. first, it's difficult for a child to time this and, after about three times locking the wall in place, it stopped locking which makes the winner's circle non-functional. so, overall, all we got out of this toy was a wind up car that runs figure eights on my kitchen table and is probably scratching the finish.as far as assembly, it took maybe 15 minutes and was fairly simple. i do like that the pieces snap tightly into place and stay put, unlike many other tracks. this is good since it will need to be carried up and down the stairs because we don't have hardwood floors and i want it stored in my son's room instead of on my kitchen table.",Negative,Negative,0.9632449

"this castle was well thought out in terms of content -- it has so many pretty details: scrollwork doors, stairs, balcony and windows, a pullout garden with a footbridge, cute miniature castle for sofia to play with and and a hanging chandelier. in the picture - all of these details really shine. but when you get it out of the box there are many glaring problems:1. the floors are made of almost paper thin cardboard. not only do the dolls have a hard time staying upright but there's no way that this will last 5 minutes with the 3-6yr old crowd. i was pretty shocked to see cardboard at this price point.2. the plastic is used to construct this castle is flimsy--think happy meal toy.3. because the plastic is flimsy, when you put the toy together you are constantly worried you will break it because it goes together by pushing the plastic into the corresponding slots.4. some pieces are tiny. there are tiny plates and goblets that fit inside the length of a dime. they warn customers about this on the box but i might think twice about giving them to a 3 year old.5. the dolls head swivels and is held together with a ball and socket that is fragile. like the cardboard issue, i can't imagine that the head with stay on for long -- especially with younger kids.6. the doors and windows pop out easily and the staircase wobbles and is awkward.overall, once together, this castle is fragile. if your child dropped it, the plastic might break, and at the very least the turrets and windows would pop off. we also have a little people castle from fisher price that take alot of abuse that is nowhere near as pretty but is much more durable, sturdy and more expensive looking with no cardboard. if you have a young child, but that one and get the disney store made sofia play figurines for them to use with the fp castle.those with older kids, you may have a fighting chance but you will be majorly disappointed by what you get for your money.i don't recommend this product at all and it's a shame because its such a great franchise.",Negative,Negative,0.95569414

"original review below.  i wanted to post to all those disappointed with the first castle release that there are replacement parts for the castle now.  mattel will send you a sofia (whose head stays in tack), a staircase (that doesn't fall off easy), a talking box (roland and miranda play royal entrance music, amber talks, clover still touchy, others say sofia voiced phrases but that have to do more with their character), and some small parts that may get lost that come with castle. they will also send you a sofia and amber doll from royal family collection.  overall, i'm happier with the product now.  and my daughter is thrilled that not everyone speaks in sofia's voice and that the heads stay on.  to new purchasers - i'm not sure what version amazon is selling. best to check the stores and get the newest release (the new one has a plastic 2nd floor).orig post.this is a product that i really wish would have been on the amazon vine program and had some reviews before the ""preorder"" was available. my daughter (3 years old) has been so excited for this toy to arrive at our home since i showed it to her when i first preordered it (her birthday was in may and it was to be a birthday gift, why i showed it to her).  she plays daily with her fisher price loving family dollhouse (everyday since christmas), and i knew a sofia castle would be amazing to her and a toy that would get alot of use.my honest advice.  if your child does not know about this toy and you are merely trying to use this as a gift, don't bother.  your life will be much happier without this toy.  buy a loving family dollhouse..i give that toy 5 stars.  if your child knows about this toy and is asking for it, purchase at your own risk, you have been warned.pros: - i think it's decently sturdy and easy to put together (minus the paper flooring on the second floor)- it's cutecons: (pretty much what everyone else has hit on)- sofia's head popped off 3 times today (""mommy, uh oh....her head came off...waaahhhhhhh"")- clover doesn't actually fit in securely in the little ""hide go seek"" window seat...he falls in to the hole (""mommy....waaahhh"")- out of about 20 tries, clover's voice worked exactly once.- i fear for the destruction of the paper floor on the second floor.i would totally return it if she didn't desire to play with it, but she played through the frustration all day.  i also fear for the arrival of the royal family to our home in a few days.  i understand that the characters don't speak correctly either, that king roland and prince james don't stand at all, and that they heads pop off the characters as well.mattel - please test your products before producing. seriously.  i knew this toy was in production since before christmas, you have had plenty of time to show it to a small panel of kids and watch them play with it.  this is the third toy we have purchased/received in a month with horrible construction from mattel (specifically this toy, the barbie dream pool, and the disney princess magicclip aurora carriage).disney - make your own toys.  you are getting a horrible name by relating yourselves to these products.",Negative,Negative,0.9123365

"i purchased this toy at wal*mart yesterday (it's $5 cheaper) for my daughter's birthday today. she turned 3 and is a huge sofia fan, so i grabbed this, the royal family, and the animal friends. my husband put the castle together last night as i decorated and wrapped, and i instantly fell in love. it's quite a bit sturdier than other castles we've owned, sofia says many cute phrases, and the extra accessories are nice additions.upon waking up, the castle had a mind of it's own. while the sofia and amber dolls both activate their own voices, james & the king activate sofia's, and the mom & clover activate nothing at all. the sofia's doll head very easily pops off, but so far has only happened once when i was taking it out of the package (for the animal friends, but all of the sofia's are built the same). of course, the voices work only when they want to which is about 25% of the time. there is a button to press on the voice box that tells it to wake up and talk---most of the time, i have to physically pull the voice box out of the castle, turn the switch from on to off back to on, and snap it back in for it to respond.overall, it's a very cute castle, it's well made and seems sturdy. the accessories are cute, but the voice box is a hot mess! i'm still on the fence about keeping it. for $54.98 (or $60 depends on where you shop) it should work!so, buyer beware---if you want just the castle, great...if you expect the voices to work? you'll be sorely disappointed.",Negative,Negative,0.94545746

"a definite ""do not buy"" recommendation. at a 40 dollar price point and an 18 month to 4 year range, this toy should be bullet proof and provide some fun or educational value.the setup was easy and tool-free.the basic premise of the toy is that the characters start at the top, slide down to the bottom of the second slide where they stop (with the help of a plastic bar). one raises the bar and catches the character in an elevator chair and brings them down to the lowest level to slide onto the stage. pressing down on the boombox activates a song and vibrates the dance stage to give an impression of dancing characters. however, none of these features work as expected. the characters topple over the  the stopper bar and fall past the elevator chair onto the floor behind. if you do manage to catch the character, they barely slide onto the stage. the vibration of the stage and the stability of the characters cause then to fall over. just a badly designed toy!a dainty 2-year old broke the elevator chair within the first 5 minutes of play. the plastic feels cheap and the connection points are poorly designed.this toy povides no educational value and the fun is done when the child is tired of the catchy tunes. my child has not gravitated to this toy since the first encounter 2 weeks ago.",Negative,Negative,0.9858343

"my kids are crazy for teenage mutant ninja turtles (abbreviated by my 3-year-old daughter as just ""turtles"" aka tmnt), so it was a no brainer when i saw this tmnt-themed game. it's for years six and up though, so it was probably a better fit for my six-year-old boy.when we got the game open the kids tore open the box.  and that's when i started assembling the tower.  the way the tower works is that it's a rickety set of plastic scaffolding, connected by pieces of stiff cardboard that have foot and grappling hook symbols on them.  these are all interconnected and balance on a single pivot point, which is a small plastic pole.  the game also comes with a measuring stick, a defeated ninja counter, four plastic tmnt bases (for each of the cardboard turtles), and a bunch of cardboard foot clan ninjas.  these ninjas all have a grappling hook design as well as slot to insert into a plastic base, so they can either stand on one of the footprints on the tower, or hang from one of the grappling hooks.  there's also a deck of shredder cards (the villain from tmnt) and a catapult to launch the turtles at the tower.there are two different kinds of games you can play with this tower.  the first is simply target practice: whoever knocks the most ninjas off wins.  using the measuring stick to ensure the players aren't too close to the tower, they take turns firing at it until all the ninjas are knocked off.the second game is more complicated.  one player manages the turtles and fires at the tower as above; the other plays shredder, managing the ninjas and moving them up the tower while searching for six special objects, presumably to summon some monster from dimension x. if shredder finds all six pieces before the turtle player knocks off seven ninjas, he wins.  don't worry though, earth is safe -- if this game has anything to say about it, shredder will never win. ever.on the surface this game seems like a tmnt-themed ants in the pants.  but in practice it's totally unplayable.  here's why: one does not simply place ninjas on the tower.  they have to be placed carefully, balancing a certain number on either side.  the ninjas distribute their weight differently by hanging vs. standing, so it requires a steady hand to add them to the tower without knocking them all off and starting over. this is nigh impossible for kids and a patience-testing exercise for adults.worse, because they are so precariously balanced, a sufficiently hard hit on the tower (totally possible with the catapult) can knock all of the ninjas off in one turn.  if you're playing the target practice game this isn't quite so bad, but makes for a short game.  if you're playing shredder vs. the turtles, the turtles win, always. and since the shredder player has to move several ninjas around every turn, it's highly likely the entire tower will get jostled and all the ninjas will fall.  this happened five times before we gave up.if the tower was a little sturdier and the pieces a little more solid, this could be a fun game for younger kids too. but as it is, this is just a frustrating exercise in ninja-tossing.",Negative,Positive,0.47262436

"take a kids icon like the ninja turtles and then create a terrible game and this is what you have. the &#34;concept&#34; itself isn't bad. you build a tower, then put &#34;foot clan&#34; members all over it and then try to knock them off with a catapult launching the turtles. the concept is good and entertaining, after all that's why i opted to get this.  the execution however is far from good and the game gets really boring the more frustrated you get.the entire assembly is very very cheap, if you had children playing this, it most definitely would not last more then a handful of &#34;games&#34;. the tower is very unstable and made of cheap, thin, plastic rods and cardboard essentially. it is easily knocked over.i would not recommend this. it is entertaining for a few minutes, but it quickly looses it's luster and the quality really is terrible especially considering the price tag. i could see spending maybe $5 on this, but at the current cost of $15 its not worth it.",Negative,Negative,0.9983454
"the teenage mutant ninja turtles flying attach board game is a cheaply made game.  it is cardboard and plastic and not very sturdy pieces, either.  it takes up a lot of room but is too cheaply made to take apart and put away or to leave out as-is.  either way, it will not last very long.  there are two games - which were not much fun to play.  it would keep a child's attention for a very short time and then off to something else.  i would rather get a board game classic or a toy that is more durable and/or more fun to play with.",Negative,Negative,0.91359526

"my daughter's on a big ninja turtles kick right now. she picked out a tmnt backpack for first grade this year, as well as a tmnt lunchbox that she loves. when i saw this flying attack game, it looked like fun. we don't play that many board games (the main ones being nightmare before christmas operation and candyland), but i knew she'd be up for playing anything with the turtles. maybe it was the universe telling me that playing the game wasn't going to be a good experience, because for some reason, i held off until yesterday to finally open up the box and play the game.we played for about 10 minutes.hands down, tmnt flying attack is the worst board game experience i've ever had. it's worse than playing perfection when i was 5 years old, terrified of the timer counting down as i frantically tried my best to get all the pieces in before the game erupted. it's worse than when i'd play battleship with my neighbor when i was 10, and they'd only use one boat on the map instead of all of them. heck, that sounds like a lot of fun -now- compared to ever playing this game again. don't take my statement above wrong- when i say that we played for about 10 minutes, it was just that. we spent even more time trying to play this game. this whole board game is just a mess, that i don't have anything positive to say about it at all.so you build the tower, eventually, and you can play one of two ways. the first, and probably the only one you're going to try, is launching the turtles at members of the foot clan as they're hanging from the tower with their grappling hooks. the other method involves one person being shredder and the other playing as the turtles. shredder's trying to get a couple of key objects to start doing some evil business, and it's up to the turtles to knock 7 foot clan ninjas off the tower before he can do it. luckily for them, shredder won't win. as another reviewer pointed out, it's pretty much impossible for shredder to even come close to winning.the key problem with the game is how poorly balanced the tower is when assembled. you're supposed to put a lot of the pieces wherever you want, yet when i tried to distribute them evenly, the tower would still lean. the green plastic rods that hold the tower up aren't that strong either, and there were a couple of times when they'd come apart just when i'd move the thin cardboard pieces onto them. it's hard enough getting the foot clan to stay 'hanging' from the tower as it is, and constant wobbling ensures they won't be there for long. the foot clan pieces are one piece of cardboard, including the grappling hooks they're holding, and it curves to allow them to hang. unfortunately, there's no slot to put the grappling hook side in, so the cardboard pieces are just hanging there with nothing to keep them in place. you can launch one turtle piece at the tower, and there's a good chance it'll have enough force to knock all of the foot clan down.that's where another problem lies though. only two of the turtle pieces we have were able to fit into the catapult properly. donatello and leonardo had no problems, but raphael and michelangelo wouldn't go into the slot for anything. why is the majority of this game made of cardboard? why not just make small plastic turtle game pieces like say, the candyland gingerbread men? is that too much to ask? they wouldn't even have to be that detailed or anything! 9 times out of 10, i'd miss the tower because it's hard to tell how far you should be from it, even with the measuring piece they included with the game.when we finished a game, my daughter went right back to playing with her monster high dolls, and i just left the game tower where it was. if she asks to play it again, of course we will, but i don't see that happening. i will give the game 5 stars in the educational value category, because this would make for an excellent example of what a board game shouldn't be. only buy this game if your kid is a huge, huge fan of the turtles, and if it's 1/4 the price it's currently at right now.",Negative,Negative,0.9415999

"the princess sofia royal prep academy board game gets off to a good start.  the box looks nice enough and the royal prep academy inside, though tedious to construct, looks great when completed.  the bracelet and charms were a big hit with my 3 year old, despite not really having anything to do with the show.  once we got to the instructions, things went sharply downhill.the instructions are written poorly, perhaps to purposely distract the end user from realizing that there is hardly any point to playing this game.  the basic mechanics are one person (the hider) draws a tile and hides a charm or a character behind a window and the other person (the seeker aka sofia) flicks a spinner and gets 1 or more chances to peek into a window of the royal prep academy.  nothing is hidden at the start, so initially your 3 year old will have to get very lucky to find something.  you probably won't make it long enough for their chances at finding something to improve too much.  my 3 year old got bored of the game and we have not revisited the experience.  i would not recommend this game regardless of age or how much your kid likes sofia the first.  instead i would recommendfly and go seek game",Negative,Negative,0.8073772
"my daughter loves sophia the first.  i've been forced to watch the cartoon so much that i can sing the song and know all the characters.  i figured i would get a game that she'd love when of the appropriate age.  i have to say i'm quite disappointed.first and foremost, the number of pieces to lose is ridiculous.  forty four cardboard castle cutouts, sixteen cards, twelve little windows, eight trinkets, seven big windows, six skinny windows, three staircase pieces, two medium windows, one bracelet, one spinning arrow, &#9835; &#9835;and a partridge in a pear tree &#9835; &#9835;.  btw - recommended age is 3 and up. (ha!)  yeah, good luck keeping all of those pieces after a game or two.as for the rules, it's a two player game, so i already know my daughter is going to be sophia and i'll be the ""hider.""  there is no debating this.  from what i gather - and the instructions are somewhat convoluted for a 3 and up game - the hider flips over a card, follows the instructions, and after all the cards are flipped over the number of trinkets (""charms"") on sophia's bracelet determine her score.  after the players replace the trinkets, flip over the cards, and switch roles (haha, that ain't happening), the game is repeated.  whoever has the most trinkets while being sophia wins.i'm sure this game could be fun with an imaginative and interactive parent, but the complexity doesn't really jibe with a 3-year old.  aside from that, sophia the character is only present on the back of the flip-cards.  she's the selling point, right?  and good luck having your daughter be the hider.  hey disney and wonder forge game, would it have killed you to even consider making the ""hider"" someone else in the game?  you know, like cedric the magician?  after all, he's about the only consistent antagonist on the entire cartoon.  and, he's always trying to get sophia's amulet.  jeez.  a little imagination please.overall, the theme song for sophia the first does a good job of summing up the problems with this game:""now i gotta figure out how to do it right,so much to learn and see""maybe a bit too much figuring out, and bit too much to learn and see.",Negative,Negative,0.54067343

"disney missed the mark on this princess sofia royal prep academy board game.  the biggest downfall of this is the fact that it really isn't very interesting or fun to play!  the idea is kind of like a one sided version of battleship, but the 'tokens' you hide aren't placed on the board all at once, but by direction of a card.  so, one person plays sofia and the other plays the hider.  sofia's job is to open windows and find objects for her charm bracelet. the hiders job is to pull a card (each turn) and follow the instructions (ie: hide a token in the window).  when all the cards run out, the players switch roles and after round two, they see who had the most charms on their bracelet.  you can see how that doesn't sound like the most exciting thing on earth, right?  as far as difficulty, this isn't difficult.  it's more frustrating, really, as you have to open windows multiple times because the tokens are placed so slowly onto the game board.  i don't think the fact you have to play this game twice to find one winner works in its benefit, either.set up is somewhat involved, as you have to push out all the windows (of which there are many) before playing the game for the first time.  the board is a hard cardboard and the pieces are pretty thin plastic.  i have a feeling these pieces aren't terribly durable.i can't recommend this game because i don't see it getting much (if any) use because it just isn't very interesting.  too bad, as i love the character of sofia.",Negative,Negative,0.77857083

"i have stated my anger towards mattel but this is a new low. i have waited for this, i wanted this, i dreamed of this day i would receive batman and robin from the 60's. but this is a big failure by mattel.this is what i wrote amazon upon trying to return this;the legs are bent or broken on the robin figure and one is longer than the other due to poor qc it looks like. very poor product and packaging by mattel which may have contributed to the problems.yeah, i got lucky as the paint job was okay...but how can one leg be longer than the other? even when i tried to unbend it, it was still longer....how? i assume it is broken around the knee area or hip joint somewhere.stay away, stay far away. mattel will blame the fans for the poor quality/sales. no they did nothing wrong or batman 66 was unwanted. they will lie, but i warn you, i am the 6th reviewer and everyone of us has had issues with this product. i will skip this and immediately return this garbage and just get the neca 18"" batman and eventual robin/burt ward figure due in 2014.note: i hope neca will attempt to release an 18"" scale batmobile, which will be unheard of and improbable.shame on mattel for this garbage product and poor quality. by the way the cape is cloth, but they stitched the mattel label on it....stitched!!! you can try to cut it off, but be careful.....but really why would you even buy it at this point.2 out of 5, batman seemed okay, but i was so disgusted with robin i didn't bother to pull him out of the packaging after seeing the robin issues and reading other reviews on youtube and amazon.update 8/5/13 i got my hands on the mattel batmobile that accompanies this line, and it is awful. soon as amazon puts it up i will state why...and yes it's cheap looking, over priced and awful piece of low quality plastic junk by mattel. mattel just does not care and neither does dc to allow this garbage by mattel. i am so angry.update 8/7/13 i decided to cancel the rest of the figures for this line. this is unacceptable. amazon sent me the expected release date in my email, but my recent interaction with this line so far, and the batmobile was the last straw. that overpriced piece of junk.....still infuriates me. i believe mattel spent money on the license and was, ""like f-bomb it, we don't care, lets just push it out cheaply and they'll buy it. if not, we'll blame the fans for not wanting it. air high five guys. again stay away from mattel!!!update 10/2/2013 it seems those who have given this set good reviews have not even bothered to open it and are determined to keep it closed for a time when these pieces of horse manure increases in value by 5 bucks ten years from now. but below are even more reasons why people seems to have given these pieces of donkey dirt 4 to 5 stars;a) never took it out of the packb) just becausec) no intelligence to give critical opinionsd) related to a mattel exec or hired for positive ratings(is that you mr. adam west)e) all of the abovemy robins' leg was twisted and one seemed longer than the other. the cloth cape with wires were awful.",Negative,Negative,0.99903715
"as a lifelong fan of the 1966 batman tv series, i bought these figures to finally own a piece of tv and cultural history. the final product proved to be less than perfect, but there are pros and cons to this controversial collection.not long ago, three different toy companies announced they would be producing lines dedicated to the batman tv series from 1966 which starred adam west and burt ward. those companies were mattel (who bought the license to monopolize the market by exclusively making 6 inch figures), figures toy co. (who bought the license to specifically make 8 inch mego-style figures using the likenesses of the batman series actors) and neca, who have an exclusive license to make figures of batman and robin literally standing at approximately 18 inches in height.as many of you know, mattel utilized a special group of contract sculptors for their popular he-man masters of the universe classics line of figures, which feature some of the best quality sculpts and designs. this team of elite sculptors is known as the four horsemen. the four horsemen are a team of specialized sculptors who work for four horsemen studios, a collectible figure design studio and manufacturer. they specialize in creating sculptures of toys and action figures. the legendary company was founded in the late 1990s as a contractor to mattel, and have since grown to an independent studio creating their own line of figures in addition to manufacturing third party designs under license.sadly, mattel did not employ the four horsemen to sculpt what i feel is the most important batman collection a company could produce. instead, mattel utilized their own sculptors. whether it was a cost-cutting measure or a simple mistake, mattel failed to deliver sculpts which captured the entire essence and realism of the 1966 batman characters. for the final product, consumers are left with cartoon-ish interpretations of real actors in costume. while these childish designs might appeal to small children or fans of mattel's wwe wrestling figure collections, most buyers and fans over the age of 12 will not be satisfied with these infantile figures.pros and conspro: the first-ever licensed 1966 batman figures we've been waiting for!con: the figures have severe quality control issues ranging from defective and weak joints to poor paint jobs.pro: batman and robin's fabric capes have wire in them which allow you to shape them for poses.con: mattel is monopolizing the market by owning exclusive rights to produce 1966 batman figures in the 6 inch scale.pro: the set includes a creative window display so you can recreate batman and robin's adventures as they climb up and down the side of the building.con: mattel uses a low-grade plastic on the figures and certain key parts differ in color.pro: the figures have suitable articulation.con: this 2-pack is currently the only way for fans to purchase the burt ward version of robin as a figure.",Negative,Negative,0.9964786
"having two heavyset native american parents, i have always struggled with my weight. by the time i reached sixteen in sixth  grade, i was five foot eleven and weighed in at two-eighty five. most of the kids in my class hadn't even begun to shave yet let alone be able to legally drive. living on a reservation, most kids drive as soon as their feet reach the peddals while seeing over the steering wheel.with halloween coming up, i wanted to impress my three kids (all boys)  by dressing up as batman.  unfortunately, the drug store we usually buy our halloween costumes at was all sold out of batman costumes. the closest thing they had batman-related that actually fit me was the dick york robin costume from the 60's batman tv show. my boys wanted to dress up as power puff girls because they love the show. being on a fixed income, i only had enough money for the unelected presidential elect john mccain costumes that were on sale (no one really likes him here in arizona.)that night, my boys and i went trick or treating in the trailer park next to our duplex behind the jiffy lube my dad works at sometimes.when we got to one of the trailers, we could see a bowl of brach's neaopolitan coconut sundaes through the partially open window next to the fish tank. however, no one answered the door. with the tv on, we figured they could not hear us. being ""robin"" that night, i decided i would grab the nearby waterhose, throw one end of it over the trailer while my three boys held onto that end and i could scale the wall the retrieve our candy.good plan in theory only.i ended up spliting my tight green shorts, having a hairline fracture on my coccyx and spent the night in the er. that in itself would of been enough, but child services and the cops where there as well asking me all sorts of questions.as a memento of that less than ""fun-filled night"" with my boys, i got this action figure set.my only gripe about it is that it looks like they are scaling a wall horizontally instead of vertically. that seems kind of lazy to me.",Negative,Negative,0.8412875
"the new 1/12 scale mattel 1966 batmobile is a rolling platform for your 6 inch action figures and not much else.first the packaging: the box art has little to do with any of the graphics evident in the original tv series. it's sturdy, so sturdy you will need to literally tear the package open to get the toy out; both ends are securely glued down, not taped (i tried using a wire to slice through cleanly, but the glue is too tough), which makes no sense at all once you finally get the thing open and find there are plastic security turn-screws that release the toy from the cardboard interior base and are designed to be reused.the toy's design is nice and large and will accommodate your figures. there are even seat-belts to secure them in.but, the details are where this batmobile begins to lose luster. the fins and nearly every other protruding item are made of soft rubber. that's wonderful if you intend to beat this thing up against walls and curbs, but at over $60 plus tax retail i don't see anyone actually playing with this. i'm pretty certain the collectors interested in this version will not be actually playing with it. the unpainted black plastic that makes up the body of the toy is scratched and gouged in many places - mine right on the hood!. i brought this issue up with the r/c version: manufacturers can produce tv remotes and other plastic housed gadgets without all this mess, why not a toy? you don't see hasbro toys with this degree of defacement.finally, there is the toy's action: there is none besides wheels that spin and a steering wheel that turns. they don't pivot left to right like even the $30 die-cast 1/18 scale version does. the box art hype mentions magnets, lasers and parachutes, none of which are included with this model. if i was six years old i'd accept the mention as a cue to pretend. i'm a little too old to pretend.in short, there is nothing here that makes any sense: for a premium of between $60 and $100 you receive a toy designed for rough play whose only buyers will be older collectors. seeing as how the separately sold batman figures will surely be placed in the toy, mattel must have envisioned that it would be removed from the box and thus subject to scrutiny. under scrutiny its value and quality just doesn't hold up. i've waited since the 1970s mego batmobile held my dynamic duo, over forty years, for a scaled model designed to hold figures. here it is at last, and it's disappointing. maybe if the price was considerably less i would still be disappointed with its lack of features but satisfied i'd received my money's worth. i am a target employee and paid somewhat less than most people will - and that is where i suggest purchasing it. do not pay more than retail!",Negative,Negative,0.9695332

"i previously wrote a review criticizing the game for being violent and anti-life, but after reading the criticisms and explanations i got, i took it off.  i then went back and looked at the age limit for the game.  it says &#34;everyone 10+&#34;.  my 5-year-old and 8-year-old grandsons have been playing it, and the 5-year-old can't get enough of it.  i'm wondering why he plays the survival part, other than that he has a tremendous will to win/live and won't give up.  he can't figure out how to survive, and i think the reason is that this is an adult game.  he has always played games older than his age because he could figure them out and master them, but not this one.  this game calls for adult sophistication and adult decision making.  i think 10 is too low an age to start playing this game, at least the survival part, and there are probably some 18-year-olds who can't figure it out.also, i notice that whenever the background music comes on i instantly relax, and i'm not even playing.  i would say that it probably puts everyone in hearing distance into alpha mode.  i would think it would be better to be fully alert to be a good player, so why use a mode that puts players into a light trance?  could there be subliminals behind the music?  what's the reason?  why am i the only one questioning it?  and why haven't the creators of the game, if they are proud of their work, talked about this game in public, how it was created and what it's supposed to do?  and especially what the music is supposed to do!to me, it would be better if the creative part of this game could be a separate game for children with the survival part omitted.  when children play the survival part, it makes the world look like a dangerous place where survival is all but impossible because they don't know how to make the decisions they need to make in order to survive.  they are just too young.  i don't think being 10 years old is going to make any difference; it's still too young an age to play the survival part of this game.  in my opinion, it's way out of the league of children under 13 and maybe even 16 or older.",Negative,Negative,0.612741

"i admit, neither my 4-year-old nor i have played any leapfrog games before this one. i played plenty of video games in my youth, and spend perhaps too much time playing games on my phone these days, so i at least am not naive to the world of gaming.a good game teaches you how to play, building up the pieces one at a time, then sets you loose. this game teaches you how to play, but builds up the pieces far too quickly.there are a couple different components of this game. there's a collect-the-widgets part, where the characters are lead through very simple mazes to collect all of the pennants. this is a pretty simple concept, but builds slowly into greater complexity - you have to avoid being seen by the bad guys, you can find bonus prizes, and so on. there are also locked doors, and to get the key you have to play a card game, like a memory game (matching cards in pairs) or a rule-out games (rule out cards based on features, like number of eyes or color of fur).here's the problem, though: the concept of lead-the-character-through-the-maze has only just been introduced when the match-the-cards-to-get-the-key part comes in. especially for younger children, this is too much, too fast. if the game taught the maze part, then had a few simple mazes to practice, then brought in the memory game, it might work. this design, with all the game modes piled on top of each other, is just confusing. in addition, new functions are taught in the middle of the game. when spitballs are introduced to blow out candles, there's not a mini-tutorial before the game. no, instead the player will be halfway through a maze, land on a spitball, and the game will stop for an explanation. this game was not designed with any sense of flow.the flow of the game breaks all the time. if the character finds one of the monster cards, it stops the maze game for a splash screen of the card, reminding the gamer to go look at their card collection some time. not now, of course, you're in the middle of a maze, so finish the maze, then... yeah.there's a subgame of building your own monster then testings its ability to scare a child. this has nothing to do with the maze/memory game, except that you need to collect the cards from the mazes to make the scary monsters.worst yet, there are bugs in the game. when you come back to a maze from the card games to get a key, sometimes the bad guys are just randomly placed instead of on their little walking tracks. sometimes the last card from the memory game tutorial stays on the board for the first run through the memory game, making it very confusing for a kid trying to learn it.would this be fine with older kids? possibly. would this work better for kids who've played a lot of leapfrog games already? probably. but i really question the assertion that this game is good for 4-year-olds. it's too busy interrupting itself in the early stages, teaching too many things at once instead of gradually building skills.it's built on the same premise as a lot of other leappad games, that constantly interrupt the child's use of the product, endlessly blurting out instructions or suggestions that distract the child from what they're trying to do - play and learn.",Negative,Positive,0.49896893

"we have two of the olderleapfrog leapster 2 learning game system - greenand 11 of the various cartridge games. i can honestly say we love each and every one of them. i had high expectations for the monster's u game on the leappad, and unfortunately i am disappointed. the game has two problem areas for me.1) it is extremely repetitive. the main part of the game is a series of easy mazes with obstacles and monsters to avoid and things to collect and use. one particular level might have 3 things to teach you (tools, strategies, etc.) but not only will it make you go through ten extremely similar mazes, and you don't ever have to use any of the strategies or tools at all.2) it is not educational. the mazes are totally not challenging, even to my 3 year old. you don't need to use any of the strategies or tools the game suggests, so why bother? one of the small side games is a version of the classic gameguess who. we love guess who and play it all the time. the monster's u version takes all the thinking out of it. for example, one clue might be that the monster in question is blue. great, so your kid learns process of elimination by turning over the other colors. unfortunately the game immediately tells you to turn over the other monsters. your kid does not have to turn on their brain and think at all. just follow the instructions like a little robot. it makes me insane.i was so worried that my kindergartener's leapster 2 would be soon forgotten when our shiny new leappad 2 and monster's u game arrived, but he finds the monster's u game so boring that he sticks with his leapster and it's excellent, fun, and challenging games. it breaks my heart to give a bad review to a leapfrog product, but it seems like all the effort went into the flashy leappad and none of the effort went into the game :(-------------------------------------------editing to add that we now have two of the leappad2 and have found tons of excellent games, challenging, educational, fun for the kids, on the leapfrog website. the kids especially love the roly poly games, solar taxi, and elements on the loose. as a bonus when you download a game you can load it on up to three compatible leapfrog devices.",Negative,Negative,0.8260872
"i'm not entirely sure what the point of the tag / leapreader books are.  as someone who enjoys reading to his daughter, and loves watching her read on her own, i don't really see the point of a book like this.  for true interactivity, there are computers and tablets.  otherwise, get a real book.  having an electronic pen that reads out a paragraph or describes a scene feels lazy - the whole point of reading is that you engage with the material yourself, not listen to a canned voice-over of a specific scene.  for fans of monsters university, it probably won't matter, since the book does capture the spirit of the new movie.  it offers a condensed story, complete will illogical narrative jumps and definitely favors big, bright pictures over words.  sorry, but these books (and this one in particular) are not something i'd ever get again.",Negative,Positive,0.43555236
"i was not impressed by this product at all. it's essentially a cheap piece of plastic that does nothing other than serve as a holder for an ipad. you download the free app that can be used on its own, snap the ipad in the plastic case (that i would not trust to keep the device safe at all), and then the stamps trigger different functionality. so, one stamp will allow you to change between safari, undersea, and city themes. another one, every time you touch the screen will place a different object (based on the chosen theme) on the screen. another one makes sounds. you get the idea. with the pen, the kids can draw all over the screen. but, these are all things that can be done without the plastic case and stamps. i also found that i was constantly picking the stamps and pen up because they would fall out of the case.  i really can't come up with a need for this case at all and it's most definitely not worth forty dollars!  the app is okay on it's own, but free kids art apps are everywhere and this one isn't anything special.",Negative,Negative,0.9973054

(hey, it rains a lot in the pacnw.)  this was kept semi-exposed to the elements in part of a loafing shed.alas, kids got on it, took off at 7mph, tried turning around the corner, but the throttle pedal stuck.  there are no brakes on this thing; you slow down by lifting off the throttle.  when you're turning at 7mph, things go badly.  the kids were thrown off into mud, and the car smashed into a tree, where it still kept going.luckily the kids were safe with just some scratches, bruises, and mouthfuls of mud.i contacted peg perego:  there are no recalls on this item, but they did send a new throttle pedal and a printout of how to install it.overall, this thing is dangerous:  there needs to be some kind of spring on the outside of the pedal casing to always push the pedal back up.  even if there already is one in the casing, redundancy would've prevented our injuries.  i don't know why the pedal sticks, but i can only guess it's because of some kind of debris got into the casing itself, which is ridiculous.  a kids toy that's mean to be outside, and dirt could potentially cause injuries?  come on guys...while fun, this is obviously not safe, and i no longer recommend it.----------------------------------------------so we've all seen the little cars at big box stores that are roughly the same idea as this:  kid gets in and can ride around.  difference is, the ones that run for a couple hundred bucks in a box store generally seats one kid, goes very, very slow, doesn't hold a charge, and can barely make it through thick carpet, much less a slight incline outside.in steps peg perego.  yes, this entire thing is still mostly a large collection of plastic parts to make it look like something cooler than what it is (but really, aren't all cars, especially luxury cars the same thing?)  the differences with this go much further:  depending on how much you're really taxing it, the battery lasts quite a while - long enough (most of the time) to have the kiddo ready to do something else.  the weight limit here is 150 (total - not per kid, fatty), and while the more weight on it the quicker the battery dies, at least it's an option.the speed of this is awesome.  with the cheaper units (i suppose designed for smaller kids that maybe can't walk yet?), the top speed is basically ""very slow walking speed"" that's kind of boring.  this one, at 7mph (or if your kiddo is small, there's a governor that'll hold it to 3.5mph), is quick.  quicker than your kid (or you) are going to be walking continuously.  no, it's not an outright sprint, driving around 7mph on this for a while is much more fun than running around at 7mph until your heart is pounding and your left arm goes numb.while we're using this on some acreage and a relatively small house, if you have the opposite (big house, not much land), it may also be fun.  however, because of its speed and ability to actually go through gravel/driveway, grass, dirt, etc, i'd say it'd be much more fun than just driving from bedroom to kitchen to living room, with a couple crashes into your tiffany lamps thrown in for good measure.delivery (for me) was done via a scheduled delivery with ceva (some delivery place i had previously never heard of) that was very friendly and accommodating to my schedule - they just needed a 4-hour window on a weekday for delivery.  setup was also very easy...and kind of fun.  there are lots of plastic pieces to snap all over the place, but it leads up to the anticipation of actually driving it around...which won't be the same day as you open the box, because...if you're buying this as a gift, unless you don't really like the kid you're giving it to, open the box and charge the battery a day or two prior.  the first charge requires an 18 hour charge, lest you damage the battery - forever.  (by damage, it means that it'll never hold a ""full"" charge, so maybe you'll end up with 10 minutes of drive time, for example.)  it's all pretty easy to get back into the box, so just do it so you don't have a disappointed little guy wishing 18 hours of his life away before he can play on his new atv.all in all, a great product that for me has been performing as well as advertising (which is actually better than i expected.)  doesn't work so well in muddy or heavily saturated yards, but i didn't really think it would.  recommended.",Negative,Negative,0.78172183

"sadly, i knew from the opening sequence that this game wasn't going to be very good.  i had high expectations that were not only not met but actually dashed to bits.  in a nutshell, this game stinks.first is the environment.  forget the lush visuals of the trailers and promos. at least 80% of the game will be spent in dark rooms, hallways, corridors, outer space, spacecraft, vent shafts and other drab environments.  second, the navigation stinks.  the navigation and objective markers are very confusing at times. and that's only when the directional objective marker actually feels like appearing (there were several times i tried to invoke it, only to get a text display of my objective and nothing more).  it can be more confusing than helpful at times, especially when it rotates 360 degrees, like when you're in outer space, zero gravity or on a multi-level structure.  and some of the mission objectives are just downright confusing.  you'll get a vague hint like ""assist so and so"" but it doesn't tell you that this assistance involves several steps that aren't very intuitive.the weapons for the most part are decent but there are major shortcomings.  for instance, the game loves to put you in rooms full of ammunition and weapons like you're in a candy store but you can only carry a ridiculously small supply. you get one primary weapon, one secondary and a max capacity refill of reach. there are two types of grenades but you can only carry one type at a time.  when you're looking at a weapon on the ground, you can see the specs for it but the lame comparison leaves a lot to be desired.  instead of orange and green bars to indicate more or less power, just do a side by side.  the worst glitch with the weapons is that some of them will simply refuse stop working and refuse to fire.  there is no explanation, no little text message to say ""too close to target"" an indication that the weapon is empty or anything.  nope, you just sit there pressing r2 like a maniac while getting riddled by the enemy.  as if ridiculous cheapness were';t enough, the ai enemies even do little victory dances over your body and take cell phone pics of their kill.  so after the game fails on you, it celebrates its failure in tacky fashion.there are adrenaline packs that you can use during battle.  they will restore your health and also give you a temporary slowed down matrix style ""bullet time"" boost.  it's helpful when facing a few enemies but pretty much useless when needed most, against scores of enemies as you'll encounter in the latter stages of the game.  like the weapons, they also seem to disappear without warning when you need them most.  i'll start a new section with a full supply of adrenaline packs but somehow go down and see the message ""no adrenaline packs available"".the tactical echo and o.w.l. were the only two things that really stood out about the game and even they had their faults.  they are usually excellent tools in your arsenal, especially for helping  deal with the darker environments.  the tactical echo acts almost like a heat sensor, displaying enemy silhouettes through walls, doors or floors.  the o.w.l. is your personal drone that is capable of providing a shield, attacking enemies, disabling enemy shields and hacking computer systems which accomplishes numerous objectives like disabling alarms, opening doors, navigating ships, disabling security systems, etc. unfortunately, when you use the most useful features like shield and pulse, it quickly drains the o.w.l. and it will end up off in a corner recharging when you really need it.  also, as far as engagement, although it occasionally kills enemies, (more in the beginning than latter stages), by the last few chapters of the game, it amounts to little more than a distraction and hacking device.  99% of the enemies will need to be dispatched by you.all in all, i played the game only because i paid for it. i can wholeheartedly say if this were offered free as a ps-plus game of the month or some other deal, i likely would have deleted it by now.  i would not buy the game again if given the chance all over again, but everyone has different tastes.  my advice is to watch a couple play through videos online just to get a grasp of the environment you'll actually be playing in versus the much prettier environments shown in the ads.  might not hurt to rent it first as well, if you're able to do so.  otherwise, grab it in a bargain bin as cheap as possible or wait to see if sony offers it as a free ps plus game (highly likely in the near future) if you simply must have it.however, if frequently getting lost in dark environments with malfunctioning weapons and vague directives while having enemies twerk over your body and take cell phone pics after a ridiculously cheap kill seems like fun, then dive on in.  this is the game for you!",Negative,Negative,0.8089072

"man was i excited to order this thing. the pictures and product information on its page made it look very cool. unfortunately, while thenerf n-strike elite centurion blasteris intended to be a heavy-duty sniper rifle toy, what it ends up being is a giant pain-in-the-neck that doesn't work right. frankly, i am baffled how this thing made it past quality control.as i show in the video, it does fire up to 100 feet (given good wind, and angling it up at least 15 degrees, 45 or more if you really want it to go for distance) -- but that is about where the fun stops.the basic problem is that it is nearly impossible to get it to load from the clip. my brother was able to do it a couple of times after carefully positioning the clip in the unit, and cocking the toy at a certain angle. i was never able to get it to load from the clip. i always had to manually load it. (which i show how to do in the video -- you basically just slide a dart into the cocking mechanism tube inside the unit after pulling down on the loading bolt a bit).  the cocking mechanism isn't firmly aligned into place, and there isn't enough give/forgiveness at the ""mouth"" of the loading tube to continue to load a dart, if the tube catches any part of the edge of the dart. a rounded/sloped/beveled edge instead of a straight/90 degree sharp angled tube mouth would have been a much better design.so, yeah, the toy hardly works at all. you can get it to load (although i am sure loading it manually like i was doing isn't very advisable, and will cause it to break even more eventually), and you can get it to fire (at least the one i got, anyway), but like any nerf toy gun, this thing isn't very accurate at range, and with the slow rate of fire, no kid is going to want to get stuck with this toy gun when they play with their group, they'd be a sitting target.i can see the vision nerf was going for with this one, and they almost made it, but those little details ended up biting them in the end. i can't rate a toy that isn't fun to play with, is hard/impossible to use for a kid, and more or less arrives broken, with anything other than 1 star. sorry, nerf, maybe next time.1 star.",Negative,Negative,0.99070555
"i was only able to shoot the gun 25~ times before it broke.the out-of-the-box assembly is simple and requires no tools. loading and readying a shot is easy, most kids should be able handle it - very little strength is needed. firing the gun provides satisfying feedback (a pleasing and authoritative cha-chungk sound). design-wise, i wish the gun came with a scope, reticule, or something to make the aiming easier. it is a long-range model, after all. there is an iphone app available that lets you aim with the phone, but you need to buy a mount (sold separately) to attach the iphone to the gun. otherwise, the gun is just equipped with rails to aim with.when it was working, the gun was able to fire 100 feet, as advertised.  the darts make a cool whistling sound as they fly through the air. i didn't get to shoot anyone, so i can't rate how painful the darts are. i'd guess that they don't hurt very much - they have a hollow rubber tip that is squishy to the touch.after shot 20 or so, the gun began to fire darts at a dramatically shorter distance. eventually, the gun could be ""cocked"" back all the way, but would only return halfway to the forward position. apparently, the internal mechanism has some sort of jam or broken part that prevents it from being fully cocked, which now keeps the gun from firing.the directions that come with the gun only give advice for fixing a dart jam, or clearing the barrel of an obstruction - nothing about how to fix the actual firing mechanism. three people worked for an hour to try and fix this gun, but to no avail. i figure that the only way to fix it would be to take the gun apart - and even then, it might need a replacement piece.if you were to give this to a rambunctious kid, or really anybody who planned to use it outside of a delicate testing environment, it would probably break even sooner, if you can imagine that.",Negative,Negative,0.9628641

"i'm not surprised to see the general remarks already cataloged for the nerf n-strike elite centurion blaster.  and while i don't like to participate in beating the proverbial dead horse, this gun was given to me so that i could offer feedback.  and like many others, i found the product problematic in the nicest terms possible.  it's a shame, really, because this gun looks absolutely awesome.  first of all, it is enormous!  it even has a bipod stand so that you can hone your sniper skills.  also intriguing, the capability to gather additional hardware such as the nerf mission app tactical rail mount to enhance your nerf warfare experience.  using an iphone or an ipod touch, you can secure apps that allow you to record missions and have scoping functionality. listen, any kid who loves nerf would definitely want to add this to their collection upon sight.this is where i'd usually run down the features of a product and offer some sort of commentary.  but i have very little to say beyond the basics due to what appears to be a ubiquitous design flaw.  while recommended for those aged eight and up, i think this particular unit skews much older.  we don't let kids play with the toys in our household, that's a job for the adults!  my experiences, therefore, with the nerf n-strike elite centurion blaster are from a grown-up perspective.  no small or careless hands operated this machinery!the unit required minor assembly, which was intuitive and uncomplicated.  but once the gun was built and loaded, it wasn't very long before the mechanism started becoming very tricky and jamming up.  i'm not talking excessive usage, i'm talking fairly conservative play time.  with patience and fortitude, you could get the unit to unstick but the issue kept recurring.  frustrated, i simply put the gun down and did a little investigating.  that's when i discovered that i was not alone in my dilemma.  others were experiencing the exact same problem and many had completely destroyed their gun.so as they say, i simply walked away.  my blaster is not broken per se, but it is relatively inoperable.  i felt like i was spending more time tending to its idiosyncrasies than to actually using it for its intended purpose.  have lots of nerf merchandising, love nerf products.  but this one needs a trip back to the design studio.  awesome idea, clunky execution.  kgharris, 8/13.",Negative,Negative,0.7990534

"it was with great excitement that my eight year old son and i opened and assembled the nerf n-strike elite centurion blaster.  the box was huge and almost intimidating, but assembly was quick and easy.  there are a few odd assembly steps so i recommend you read the brief instructions.  the first few days of play were great.  my son lined up rows of star wars figures and could comfortably knock them down from 20 feet away.  accuracy was exceptional.  then came a jammed dart; my son had caulked the chamber forward, and in doing so, squeezed a dart halfway between the magazine feeder and the barrel.  at first, it looked like a simple problem to solve, but after 30 minutes, i gradually started having to use more and more force to dislodge the stuck dart.  ultimately we freed it, but the blaster was toast.  we could hear a few small plastic parts rattling around inside, and the normal caulking action didn't work.  so after just a few days of light-duty use, the blaster was broke.bottom line: before you purchase this blaster, carefully consider who would be using it, and whether they'd be susceptible to getting darts stuck in the barrel chamber.  nerf makes a number of solid blasters, including thenerf n-strike elite: strongarm blaster,nerf n-strike elite: rough cut 2x4 blaster, andnerf n-strike elite firestrike blaster.  for some reason, as nerf's blasters get bigger and more expensive, they get less reliable.what you need to know about this blaster:- the blaster is huge, measuring 36+ inches long - not appropriate for small areas or bedrooms- the blaster is big and heavy, not appropriate for smaller kids- it shoots darts 100+ feet, not for inside use!- it's fairly accurate, hitting a 3"" target from 20' is easy- the darts whistle as they fly through the air - very cool- the darts are durable and seem resistant to damage- the blaster is too big to run with - smaller kids will easily trip running around with this thing- if the blaster jams, it's probably permanently out of service unless you want to try disassembling 25 screws and tons of springs and small plastic partsmy recommendation for buying:- if this is for an older/taller child that's patient and able to carefully use the blaster, then the nerf n-strike elite centurion blaster is worth consideration.  if you're purchasing this for a smaller child between the ages of 8 and 11, i suspect that the blaster won't last long and therefore shouldn't be purchased.my rating:i'm rating this as two stars.  one star for fun and accuracy, and another star for value (you get a great package for the price).  but due to the lack of durability, quality, and ease of use, i'm leaving off three stars.",Negative,Negative,0.77886474
i got this for my kids to use as they really love nerf products.  the gun is extremely long and is very hard for them to use.  the gun is recommended for eight and up and they are almost eight so i thought it would work.  it is made for older children and adults as they are better able to use it.  the gun also does jam quite frequently and doesnt work right all the time.  the gun also just comes with 6 darts and you must invest in more if you really want to keep playing. last the gun doesnt seem to get anywhere near the 100 ft that it says.  overall i would try a different nerf gun than this as it really has lots of problems and doesnt work well for younger kids.,Negative,Negative,0.94998133
"this seems to be an exercise in trying to look all big and bad for show while frankly being utterly impractical and almost unusable.i was never a fan of either the nerf longstrike or longshot -- the idea of big, long, bolt-action ""rifle-like"" dart guns has never made sense to me.  in a real cube war or in hvz, the action is usually more rapid and random, and the idea of someone being allowed enough time or an opportunity to play ""sharpshooter"" is just ridiculous.  however, there are modding kits out there that will let you take a longshot or longstrike and turn it into a more useable dart gun for such activities.  also, nerf offered those dart guns with shoulder stock and barrel extension attachments that were meant to be optionally attachable and removable at will -- you could use the different attachments to make either of these guns into the kind of gun you wanted, and nerf actually marketed these dart guns as having this kind of flexibility.however, the centurion is designed deliberately to be used in one and only one configuration -- fully assembled into something over 3 feet long.  in fact, nerf designed the centurion so that you can't even load the clip until the barrel extension is attached, and then, the barrel extension is meant to remain permanently attached -- this is honestly rather obnoxious!  the option should be there to use this thing with or without the extension.  unlike real guns where a longer barrel makes a bullet travel farther and straighter, a longer barrel in a foam dart gun just adds drag that slows down the dart -- so the barrel extension on the centurion is not to be regarded as a plus.that said, even if you were in a dart battle where you really had a good opportunity to play sniper, this dart gun is still just ridiculous.  the bolt-action uses an insane amount of backwards-forwards travel that just slows you down between shots -- i can't believe they really had to design it that way.  i think you'd be better off with a longshot or longstrike with one of the many mod kits out there that would improve the amount of power it can put behind each shot -- you'd end up with something of a shorter and more sensible length with a bolt action that doesn't involve a full foot of travel.in short, i can't see a real purpose for this thing other than maybe long range target practice?",Negative,Negative,0.9877701

"edit (moved from below):edited: after several weeks of daily use (what can i say, it's been fun), i am starting to see a major reliability issue with the cs-18. something is loose--not sure if it's electrical or mechanical in the safety mechanisms for making sure the system does not fire when unloaded. either way, it's not a good thing to pull the trigger and have nothing happen.i'm convinced at this point there is a design flaw. i'm leaving up my original review, because i had fun writing it--but i would not recommend the cs-18 unless nerf addresses the very real issue of a kid's toy not being able to work longer than about 6 weeks.original review follows:the n-strike elite rapidstrike cs-18 blaster is the latest entry from nerf arms for the battle against nerf-allergic-aleiens. while it is true that no such aliens have attacked us (yet) nor has their home planet been found (yet), i do appreciate the long running efforts to provide blasters for the battle. after all, hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, and if we leave defense planning in the hands of the pool noodle advocates, that's where we'll be.the cs-18 has several developments that will prove useful in the coming battles with the naas. first, there is the high-capacity 18 round clips. this serves useful, as the best guess is that naas will travel in groups of 6, and 3 groups make up an attack squad. the 18 round clip that is included is see-through, though that sword cuts both ways: you can see how many rounds remain, but so can the naa. it will help battlefield commanders to verify their warriors go onto the plains of battle fully loaded.second, the rapid fire development is improved over other models. fully automatic fire from the cs-18 will help with the speedy onslaught of the alien menace.third, the collapsing stock allows for concealment as well as an adjustment to fit both the ""ooh, this is awesome"" battalion of naa fighters as well as the ""dad, you're being a nerd"" battalion. this latter battalion comes through when it counts, though. the carry handle makes transport easy.fourth, surprisingly, the needed 4 c batteries do not disrupt the balance of the cs-18. the power module fits into the shape of the blaster in one of the natural grip positions, forward of the clip. this requires most entry-level warriors to keep both hands on the blaster, but his will stabilize aim in combat. those naas are coming, and we must ready.the stability of aim is one of the reasons that the cs-18 will need to be augmented with other entries from nerf arms, and i hope that they will continue to develop this area. while centering the target reticle on a location is generally going to cause one of the 18 rounds to hit it, the overall accuracy of a straight piece of foam, propelled straight out of a short barrel, with a rubberized tip, is exactly what anyone with a clue about ballistics would expect.that is not to say that the attacking hordes of naas will not be held back--rather just to warn the user that the cs-18 is more effective against group formations at range--than it is against a single target. especially if that target is somewhat shielded. this is not quite the area-suppression blaster that the hailfire system is, but also not a pinpoint accuracy device.another drawback is that, while current intelligence shows that naas cannot hear the high-pitched fan of the acceleration module, eventually the naas will be able to hear that high-pitched sound and the element of surprise will be lost. to see the results of this, simply attempt to use the cs-18 in a training scenario when the mother of the battalions has decreed it ""calm time"" and you will recognize that the noise can be disruptive.the tactical rail allows the addition of accessories, though i found adding a laser sight and flashlight made the cs-18 a bit unwieldy. that was also a greater investment than was appropriate in the face of potential user errors.eventually, one expects the spring in the detachable clip to wear out and the whole unit to need replaced--but those are available through the primary suppliers, including here at jungle-com, and include additional ammunition with the clip.in all? i recommend this as a primary infantry blaster for the coming war with the naas. the larger weapons, such as the rampage or hailfire, should be distributed among the battalions as appropriate, but each individual warrior should be equipped with a cs-18. (and a pocket back-up blaster, but that's another discussion.)edited: after several weeks of daily use (what can i say, it's been fun), i am starting to see a major reliability issue with the cs-18. something is loose--not sure if it's electrical or mechanical in the safety mechanisms for making sure the system does not fire when unloaded. either way, it's not a good thing to pull the trigger and have nothing happen.",Negative,Positive,0.3835253

"this kit looks promising on the outside, but on the inside it is a disappointment. others reviews discuss the experiments being dull or repetitive, having to get a bunch of other ingredients, and the overall cheapness of the set and that is all true, at least to some extent.my main gripe is the supporting materials. there is a six page black and white guide that comes with the kit. one page is just the cover and 1/2 of the last is empty, so you end up with 4-1/2 pages to discuss the lab procedure and all the ""science"" in kit. it is formatted like a poor office memo and has no pictures, worksheets, or anything else. 2/3 of a page is spent calling test tubes ""baby soda bottles"" and saying you can put water and glitter in them or other random things. i think it is supposed to make science approachable, but it falls flat. the sum of the science (""how does it work"") is about 1/2 page.even with the paucity of materials in the kit, it could be good if there were supporting materials. for example, have a few illustrations showing how to do each experiment. in the ""how does it work"", show a picture of a polymer and show how it looks with and without water. have a section to ask kids to write down things (sketch, size, weight) before and after. add color (one or two at least, maybe full?). this is pretty basic stuff that any supplier of educational materials should know about.as it is, it is disappointing all around.edit: as i put away the box i saw ""more than 25 activities"". i looked over the manual and there doesn't appear to be 25 activities .... unless you count the trivial things. for example, there is 2/3 of a page describing the test tubes and it lists 7 ""activities"" such as ""discovery tube - use a baby soda bottle to collect all sorts of goodies on you next nature walk.; time capsule - use a baby soda bottle as a weatherproof time capsule or secret message holder; ..."" the original exercise is basically looking at the test tube, so at least eight of the 24 activities are trivial just on this one page. the rest aren't much better. i think my 2-star review might be a bit generous.",Negative,Negative,0.9463237

"a couple clarifications before i evaluate the game: i enjoy many game types, but i like cooperative because i can involve my kids (11, 9, 7 at time of this review). my kids love forbidden island (fi). they can struggle, work together, and win. they bought me forbidden desert (fd) for my birthday because they thought they'd like playing it with me.they (and i) were disappointed. it is significantly more difficult, meaning that while they may often win in fi, they more often lose in fd. the game mechanic is the same: you lay tiles (randomly) to create a playing board. this creates a different board each game (like settlers of catan or carcassone). this adds to the replay-ability. in fi, you'd have the chance a tile would become submerged, and if not acted upon, perhaps would disappear. this meant that often, you'd have a chance to go do something before that happened. that was really the only &#34;time&#34; aspect to that game.with fd, you have two or three timing elements, making it much more difficult. the first is that instead of fi's 2 states of any given land tile (submerged or not-submerged; i guess &#34;gone&#34; could be a third state), fd has many - you add &#34;sand dune&#34; tiles on top of the land. meaning that instead of only having to address a flipped/submerged tile once to clear it (in fi), with fd, you may have to spend many turns clearing a single tile from the many dunes on it.the second timing element is that you have a limited water ration and you can't really replenish it. sure, there is an annoying card combo (/if/ someone has a water carrier role, and /if/ that person goes to the well when it is uncovered, and /if/ that person can get to another person), you can provide water to someone else. otherwise, you will have party members dying from exposure within a few cycles through the deck.finally, the third way you can lose is that if all the sand dune tiles are used up, the game ends. so even if you are diligent in removing dunes, if you aren't fast enough, you can lose that way!i have only played this a few times with my kids, but we have managed to lose each way without having won yet. for a grown-up group, i believe we could win, but i generally don't play co-operative games with other adults (more into competitive games, then), so this doesn't apply.sorry, but this game doesn't do it for me. i'm actually sad because i wanted to like it but it gets no love in my house. we'd rather play village, kingdom builder, or even forbidden island instead.",Negative,Positive,0.49144998

"i thought this would be the perfect solution for my almost-3 year old who's dealing with some sensitivity issues. the ability to use visual indicators with sound being optional is fantastic! however, i ran into some hurdles while using it.pros:---&#62; brilliant to make this magnetic with a kickstand that you can use on a flat surface.---&#62; sensory-friendly product because it has visual indicators with an optional warning alert and a sound indicator, also optional.cons:---&#62; when i was setting the timer, the entire display went dim so that i couldn't see the numbers. but then when i come back to the clock function, the display was normal again. i assumed this was a defect and returned it.---&#62; the led lights that turn on when you're using the timer function were weak -- not bright enough to be seen in a room that is well lit. if it's a sunny room, it'd be even more difficult to tell whether they're on or off.---&#62; the clock function doesn't add anything to the time tracker because the display itself is so small that the clock is hard to read unless you're right in front of the product. however, because this timer is both a clock and a timer, having both makes using either function much more cumbersome in terms of navigating the menus and button pushing. the features could easily be separated out if it's important to keep both in the product.---&#62; the instructions were confusing. there are two main buttons that you must press for major functions -- the green one and the red one. however, when i read the instructions, i initially couldn't get some things to work because it referred to the enter button. soon i figured out that sometimes pressing enter meant the green button, but other times it meant the red one. hopefully the instructions can be clarified as this is an easy fix.",Negative,Negative,0.9589554
"i received this at no cost through the vine program. otherwise i would have returned it. here's why.1. i dislike any product that relies on deceptive advertising. there is a picture of a child holding this bag which makes it seem much larger that it is. in fact this bag measures only 9 inches across and is 8 inches high (excluding the handles). not very large at all.there is another picture showing this bag overflowing, and with no room to put in nine pieces of fruit and vegetables lying on the ground. another deception, because if you put in all 16 pieces that come with this bag, you will fill it up only about 2/3 of the way.2. i already have melissa & doug playtime fruits and melissa & doug playtime veggies. there is no comparison. in contrast to this product, where everything is the same size, with the melissa and doug products the fruits and vegetables are sized like in real life and also have more detail than this product. the quality of the plastic and coloring are also superior.3. i have visited no less than three different children's museums in three different states (ny, nj and nh) with my 2 year 9 month old granddaughter. all of them have play fruit and vegetables, but none of them have anything that looks like this product. all use melissa and doug fruits and vegetables.bottom line: this is cheap looking, unrealistic, and is marketed in a deceptive way. if you really want to teach your child about fruits and vegetables, go with melissa and doug.",Negative,Negative,0.9456642

"a great idea/concept but has some flaws. i will cover the highs and lows below.+ fun colors and the ability to &#34;slam&#34; answers for fun.+ different games extend game play time and create more interest instead of a single mode.(that is why there is two stars)(here is why it failed to earn 3, 4 or 5 stars)- targets 8+ year old students but fails to test 10s, 11s or 12s. these are core to learning at this level and they are the real challenge for most students. what good is a quiz machine that fails to improve the hardest items at that age? seems like this should be more of a 6-8 year old product, not 8+ years. this is a big deal for me.- size & build quality: this is much smaller than you would expect--the second you see the retail box you will be saying &#34;really? is that all it is?&#34; it needs to be larger for the price that they are trying to get. the build quality feels like a prototype--cheap plastic, less than impressive retail box, poor sounds and a decently alarming defect rate among reviewers. honestly while my unit didn't break during use, it would not have surprised me at all and the other reviews back that concern up. even the buttons are less responsive than you would expect so you feel like you need to slam them down to get them to register.it seems like 10-20 of these should have been made and then actual consumers with children the target age brought in to test them to work out these issues before production. i would have been shocked if some of these points weren't raised by the first few people testing them.if this review helped you, please let me know. :)",Negative,Negative,0.6287087

"this is a well designed toy that my son was very excited to get since he is working on multiplication facts and was very enthusiastic about having a toy help him to do so.first things first, he turned off the volume after about 5 minutes of playing with it. the music in the background is horribly annoying and tinny - even to an 8 year old who enjoys noise! i offered earphones and got a 'you must be crazy' look for that. the voice that narrates the instructions and gives feedback is a high pitched extra enthusiastic voice that would fit better with toddler toys. upon asking the child why he didn't want the volume on i was informed that it sounded like a baby toy and was embarrassing. ok then.so, volume off, he continued playing with it with waning enthusiasm over the next few days. yup, it has some cute games - skip counting, speed multiplication, missing factors, sequencing multiples and finding factors for a number. all well and good but the flashing lights and annoying music were just a bit too much. to cap it all off, the center top button stopped working so that is the end of that.i think the creators of the toy misstepped by making a babyish toy for material that is meant for kids who are trying very hard to not be associated with anything remotely babyish. besides that, many toys have the option of turning off the music and leaving the voice on. this one does not. the headphone jack is a nice touch if the child is willing to listen to the racket.unfortunately, i think multiplication facts and many other mathematical concepts are better learned and taught by apps on your phone or tablet. for a child with access to apps, this toy is a disappointment.",Negative,Negative,0.986819

"update:  i originally gave this four stars (see my original review below).  my kids and i test-played it for less than an hour yesterday, before i posted the review.  today, when i turned it back on, it simply wasn't working.  i thought maybe it was the batteries.  put in three fresh aa batteries but same problem, the toy was not turning on.  this is just terrible.  we didn't even go rough on it -- no, we didn't slam on the buttons even though this is called multiplication slam and the bubble-shaped buttons appear to be made to be banged on.i received this for review from amazon vine so no real loss for me other than time spent testing it and writing the original review.  i don't know if my experience reflects general quality problem.  it was fun while it lasted... for under an hour total playtime!original review from yesterday:the multiplication slam is a fun electronic game that helps kids memorize multiplications up to 9x9.  it has ten colorful bubbles that house leds which can display numbers up to 2 digits, and a center non-backlit lcd for showing simple questions. the bubbles can be slammed when you answer the questions.there're five games, from easiest to hardest for the same level of learning:1. skip it: for practicing multiples of 2 - 9.2. fast facts: you pick a number 1 - 9 and do multiplications with that number as a factor and another number as the other factor.  so for example if you pick 3, you'll be given questions like 3x7, 3x2, 3x0, etc.3. factor frenzy: you pick a number 1 - 9 and in the lcd window you're given a multiplication that has your chosen number as a factor as well as the product, you now answer the other factor. for example if you pick 7, you'll be asked 7x?=49.4. factor pairs: here you're shown a number in the lcd and in the top green led bubble, and you're given 4 numbers in the bottom 4 bubbles. two of those numbers will make a pair that multiply into the top number. you have to slam those two numbers.5. sequence: you pick one of three difficulty levels and fill in the missing number in a five-number sequence. you're not told what the multiple is. for example i picked level 3 and was shown this sequence: 21, --, 35, 42, 49. two choices were shown inside the bottom two led bubbles, 28 and 30.  i needed to slam the correct bubble.my grade school kids like the games a lot, even though to me they're repetitive. i'm not very good with math so i play it, too. it's amazing you can get so many questions out of 9 by 9 numbers, plus 0 in the middle 3 games.while the games are educational, the toys suffers from some minor design flaws. first of all, they could have spent like a penny and put in a little backlight for the lcd in the center. because it's deeply recessed, you need a lot of ambient light to see the lcd numbers. second, the volume is loud and cannot be adjusted. third, on the unit i received, the single screw that holds the battery compartment cover closed was extremely difficult to loosen. it almost wanted to make me rate this 1 star. they should have just made it a screw-less latch door.the minor complaints aside, this is a fun game for kids learning multiplications - and adults who need to relearn!",Negative,Negative,0.90257066
"i was very excited  when i first saw this toy.  my son is recently getting into investigating everything.  he's been asking for a telescope and we've been discussing microscopes and how they work.  this seemed like a nice match of interests and toy.all i can say is that this is a very cheap and ineffective item.  my husband and i couldn't see anything through the viewer, no matter how we adjusted it.  the belt clip that comes with the solver scope easily falls off and my son was running to us every 5 minutes to have us fix the clip back on the scope.he played with it for an hour or two and i haven't seen him touch it since.  i'm not surprised since it doesn't even work as a telescope, let alone focus in as a microscope.there's a cool little explorers journal with it that might interest a slightly older child, but the overall toy just doesn't hold up.  there are better explorer tools out there.shanshad ^_^",Negative,Negative,0.9353308
"the educational insights crime solver score and forensic activity journal comes in two parts and each really needs its own review to be fair.pros: the forensic activity journal though short, is very detailed with good activities. the usual fingerprint activity that you get in crime solver kits is here but it includes more detail that usually found. textile pictures are also included for examination, and a pictorial mystery requires you to use the fingerprint knowledge from the earlier activity.  overall, the journal is just fine.cons: the crime solver scope is just disappointing. in the image it appears larger.  small is fine if it works but it only works easily if you are looking across a distance to focus. no matter how much the kids, teens, or adults in the family tried, it was almost impossible to actually focus the scope with any accuracy on the images in the journal unless you stood far away, which makes no sense if you are trying to sit down and work with a journal. we ultimately ended up switching out the scope for a large magnifying glass to use with the journal. less cool looking but much more effective.as much as this looks like a quality product and the guide is good, if you buy it you should do so with the understanding that you are really purchasing a guide that is going to need you to supply the magnifying glass to have a productive outcome.",Negative,Negative,0.97746086

"after playing with this microscope for a couple of hours, i concluded that the company spent more effort on designing the eye-catching box and graphics than in designing a usable microscope. there are several problems that make this toy too frustrating to really be useful. the first is that all the microscope ""movement"" pieces are plastic, and so the focus mechanism is extremely poor . . . so poor it makes the toy almost unusable.to test the device, i got a cucumber leaf from the garden that has spider mites. i found at 30 power it was extremely frustrating trying to get a view of one of the many mites on the leaf. the focus mechanism is very crude, and has many ""stick and jump"" spots, making smooth focus impossible. even worse, when you try and adjust the focus, it causes the platen to move laterally, causing you to ""lose"" the item you were trying to focus on.if you are familiar with microscopy, you will know that it can be a challenge to get the item you are interested in into the field of view. if touching the focus knob causes the field of view to ""jump"" over a millimeter or so, getting a point of interest in the field of view and in focus becomes almost impossible. with some work, i was able to get a spider mite and spider mite egg into view and in focus at 30x magnification. at 30x the image clarity was marginally acceptable. the microscope needs a brighter light, as even at 30x the image is fairly dim and low contrast.i found it virtually impossible to use at 100x. it was simply too frustrating trying to get the mite into the field of view and in focus. also, the image at this magnification was quiet dim.i am all for educational toys, and especially for getting girls interested in stem. however, i fear that this toy is so cheaply made it would have the opposite effect.perhaps it is just not possible to build a marginally functional microscope at this price range. in any event, i would suggest spending a little more and getting a unit that has some degree of precision in the focus.in addition, i would suggest that there are some excellent digital microscopes for not too much more money than this. a digital microscope plugged into a computer opens a wide range of interesting, fun, and educational possibilities.i wanted to like this toy, but unfortunately, i can not recommend it.",Negative,Negative,0.9980698

"warning, cut the neckstrap (cord) off of this. my 5 year old grandson was playing with this shortly after christmas and the neckstrap did not break away, instead he has a at least a 4 inch welt on his neck from it cutting into his neck, he was rolling around and playing on the floor and the strap cut into his neck and left the welt.i think this is a serious enough danger that it needs to be looked further into, as this toy is marketed for children as young as 3 years old, and my grandson is almost age 6 and was still hurt by it. i feel that we were lucky because someone was right in the room with my grandson, but this could be a dangerous toy if a younger child was playing with it and was not right in front of a caregiver/family member.i have emailed the manufacturer of the toy and will be filling out a cpsc incident form as it occurred to me just how easy it could be for a minor incident like my grandson suffered to turn into a tragedy for a child.original review:i know comfortable might be an unusual concept to attribute to a pair of binoculars, but the soft rubbery ""cushion"" around the eye piece is just that. my five year old grandson just loves these, easy for him to use by himself to explore the world around him. however, as a reviewer, i thought i should actually try the product myself to get a better idea of the function and practicality of the item. i usually do not like using binoculars, as it is difficult for me to comfortably look through them while wearing my strong prescription glasses, but the cushion actually made these comfortable for me to use.",Negative,Negative,0.87463784

"years ago, my wife and i bought gund plush bears for two of our nieces (toddlers at the time), and they carried them everywhere, finally wearing them out. so i know gund makes first rate plush toys that will outlast most other brands. the abc elmo is a handsome lad, very soft and huggable, and just the right size for toddlers to carry around.but there's a real problem, and i can't recommend buying this elmo. when you press his left hand, he sings the abc song. it's a great song, and my wife and i have had a lot of fun playing it and singing along. but when the battery dies, elmo will never sing again, because the gund designers failed to make the battery replaceable. poor elmo is doomed to become permanently mute, and that's likely to be soon, because the built-in lr44 battery is very small. the lr44 is used almost entirely in calculators, where they work great, but for driving elmo's voice, it probably won't last long.my biggest problem with gund is that their product description doesn't say a word about the battery not being replaceable. how can the company possibly think that kids and their parents won't be extremely upset when elmo stops singing?it's unfortunate, because this is a nice elmo that kids would love if the battery was replaceable. since elmo is going to lose his voice anyway, i recommend looking at a songless version like this one:gund sesame street elmo 15"" plush. it's cheaper, and it's basically the same elmo without the abc shirt.",Negative,Negative,0.8398091
"this is a great looking, attractive toy. i was really excited to get this for my baby, as i had never seen a plush xylophone like this one before. upon receiving the xylophone, however, i was quite disappointed to find that the toy does not represent a real xylophone at all! rather than each separate key responding to the mallet with a single tone, any tapping, bumping, or moving of the xylophone sets off a series of notes and short melodies which continue even though the xylophone is no longer being hit. this cycle repeats in the exact same way each time and gets quite annoying pretty quickly. as a musician i was pretty disappointed that my baby couldn't play with this toy and find joy in creating his own music. i guess our piano will have to do, since he can walk over to the piano on his own and play it by himself...now, when i received my xylophone it worked (as i previously described) for maybe 5 or 10 minutes, and then it started to freak out. it would set off the cycle of notes when it wasn't even touched, and when we tried to get the thing to start playing it wouldn't do anything at all! i'm assuming we received a defective one, as this happened after only having it for 10 minutes, and i haven't seen another review mentioning this problem. we are quite disappointed that it never really worked!now, my son doesn't find the actual xylophone part of the toy too interesting since the sounds don't work. however, he does like to carry the soft little mallet around and bang it on anything and everything...",Negative,Negative,0.99683857

"this is the iron patriot, as how he appears in the movie, iron man 3. kind of a change from the comics, as in the comics? the iron patriot is piloted by norman osborne and is a villain. in the movie? the iron patriot is piloted by tony's friend james rhodes and is an update of the war machine armor. got that? okay, on to the figure!if you're lucky enough to own the war machine toy from either the iron man 2 wal*mart exclusive or the iron man: armored avenger series, you are going to be disappointed as this toy comes nowhere close to the level of quality that toy had.articulation wise? the patriot has head, shoulder, mid-bicep, elbow (double joint), wrist, abdomen, hips, thigh, knees (double joint), and ankle articulation. bad news? is that because of the mold, the ankle articulation is useless as his armor makes moving his feet impossible. the wrist articulation is also hindered by the piece of plastic on the back of his hand, rendering repulsor poses unworkable. shoulder movement is hampered by the shoulder pads - you can move them but it causes the pads to lift up and look awful. finally, the head movement is also limited. all of this together gives the toy a very stiff and awkward feel.paint apps are pretty good, right down to the tiny lettering on his breastplate and insignias on his left arm. there is a little slop to be found on the elbows, but that's all i could see. detail wise? the figure does alright as it does capture the complicated look of the armor.the shoulder mounted gun weapon is problematic. first? it looks kind of wimpy. second? it's attached to the figure by pegs, not a slide groove. this kind of limits what you can do with the gun.this toy also comes with the left arm to the iron monger build a figure.overall? if you have war machine? i would say pass on this figure. it came really close to being a nice offering from marvel legends, but with the issues i described above? i really can't recommend this toy.",Negative,Negative,0.9967693

"i admit that i am spoiled on lego products.  i've built more than my share of lego items along the way, and have bought plenty of them for my son, later my nephew, and now also wife 2.0's grandson.  i know that if i pick up a lego set that i'm getting a top quality toy that is a lot of fun and which will fit together tightly into a durable model once something has been built.  in the case of lego's creator series and their technic series you can get some highly creative models that offer up various mechanical features that take the models to the next level.in the case of the star trek universe, at least the rebooted star trek (2009 and beyond) universe, the winner of the right to produce star trek toys is apparently hasbro, which means that rather than getting lego sets we have kre-o sets.  similar, yet not the same.in the case of the kre-o minifigs, i might give a slight edge to kre-o since the kre-o minifigs seem to offer a little more flexibility, but beyond that, i'd say lego has kre-o beat.ooops, one other area where kre-o can claim a big edge - their light up technology.  that is a cool feature and it does make these models look a little neater but in the end the models that these kre-o star trek sets create feel less durable and just a little ""cheaper"" by comparison.  for example, there are 4 legs that are sit under the shuttle craft in this particular set that just don't fit into the base of the shuttle craft as tightly and securely as the same types of bricks/blocks that are genuine lego would.i wanted to like these models much more, and in the end, my heart just isn't in these as much as i would like.  i appreciate the enterprise model offers a playable saucer control deck, and that the shuttle craft here opens up so you can slide mr. sulu into control of the shuttle craft, but i'd have to say if that lego had the license for the trek related buildable toys, i think i'd be happier.if you can obtain these sets at a reasonable cost, then by all means enjoy.  they aren't horrible, they just don't quite meet the level that a lego builder would expect.",Negative,Negative,0.53013897

"the concept of the beam box is simple enough and the easy to use plug and play set up was an added bonus.  however, the actual practical aspects of the gameplay are far from engaging.  to begin, the graphics are rather weak.  not really a deal breaker but beware that this pales in comparison to even the handheld gaming systems.  i was also not impressed with the fact that this uses 4 aa batteries for the actual console and 2 aaa batteries for the wireless controller!  parents who are fed up with battery hogs should avoid this at all costs.  why not include a power adapter or maybe allow for the console to get its power from the tv?  additionally, the 7-year old i gave this to found it enjoyable for a while, but once the newness wore off, his interest waned considerably.  the problem is that the gameplay is rather repetitive and easily mastered.  not to mention that the wireless controller has a range of around 10 feet from what i could gather and it must be aimed toward the console or it will not work properly.  the controller is also very simplistic; just the directional pad and one button that must be pressed repeatedly to accomplish everything else.  this game system is definitely better suited for kindergartners, but i suspect that they too will tire of it after a while.  this means having to purchase another beam box transformer bot to get some variety.  but even that is not much better as buying additional character bots simply allow that particular character to be played in the exact same game levels programmed into the game console!  overall, this game system has too many downsides to make it a worthy purchase.  the fact is that there are several other gaming options available for young kids that are far superior and fun in the long run.",Negative,Negative,0.8859098

"i've been trying to help my 3rd grader memorize her multiplication tables and was hopeful that this game would help, but unfortunately it did not... and it was incredibly boring to boot. the game play is very odd because of the distribution of the numbers... after 24 or so, there are hardly any cards, which means that numbers like ""7x7"" or ""8x6"" or ""9x4"" are only going to be solvable if you have a wild card (yes, they had 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, but not much in between). it was annoying and disappointing to see how often we could only play a turn by using the number 1 (7 x 1 = 7 hooray!) or a wild card. and there just that weren't many number combinations with answers.... with 2 of us playing, you'd end up with 20 cards in front of you before you'd finally get another wild card or ""1"" (or occasionally a 2x2=4) and could play something. since my daughter already knows her multiplication tables up through 5, this game was neither educational nor fun for us.",Negative,Negative,0.89311844

"i hate writing a bad review for a transformers toy (unfortunately something that's become increasingly common), especially for one i anticipated as eagerly as this one, but he is an absolute failure as a toy. most of him seems good, great even, visually he's a delightful updating of the original depiction, incorporating new engineering, better materials and more appreciable design flourishes, but he has a very few aspects that just went mind-bogglingly wrong. his transformation isn't inherently difficult and it doesn't look terrible, but his feet absolutely lack any forethought - in tank and jet mode they stick out awkwardly, get inthe way and are difficult to position correctly (annoying since they're incorporated in his jet mode) and in robot mode they just look extremely silly and ineffective (though they do manage to hold him up quite easily).the next problem is his head/nose cone. for some reason they used a thick, bendy rubber for the part that folds back to reveal the head. i understand that it was necessary for it to bend under the catch to hold it out in vehicle form, but it's so frustrating and disappointing (when it is ""up,"" you can see the cracks when his head forces the nose up and buldges where it's holding it in), they needed to scrap it and use a different mechanic - no reason it couldn't have been a slight alteration to the nose cone they used for classics starscream, but it it isn't. on top of this, they tried to allow the canopy to the cockpit to open when in jet mode, which would normally be a delightful touch, only it gets in the way of the clasp mechanism holding the rubber nose and cannot open to a remotely functional position (and consequently gets in the way while transforming). his head, aside from being a super gaudy yellow, has a spring mechanism, likely in an attempt to make it pop up while transforming in a ""cool"" way, which would have been awesome if it had worked, but, as it is, when you push the head down to flip the nose cone up (something that requires considerable force since the hinge of the nose cone is a thick, bendy rubber)nothing really holds it down and it pops up after a few seconds (longer than it takes to flip the nose cone up, creating great frustration in that aspect of the process -and- pushing the nose cone up when locked in place, creating an unseemly yellow crack where it should be smooth purple - a huge pet-peeve of mine, transformation joints need to fit against each other smoothly or it ruins the illusion). they should have scrapped the spring mechanic and just incorporated a manual lever to push the head up and down.even his hands have difficulty holding the weapons (which don't have much of a place to go in vehicle mode - the gun can hide a bit or even look like part of it, but the sword sticks out like a sore thumb), the bulk of his wrists requires you to position the weapons at an angle if you want the peg (which could easily be longer) to fit the hole. the sword gets away with looking alright, but the gun just looks like he's fumbling around with it. he, gratefully, has a missile shooting mechanism in his tank turret (not a light up or spinny gimmick, i've always preferred spring missiles) and normally i wouldn't complain, but given that -something- needed to go right i will point out that you get 0 lift with the missile, it just kind of slides out of the turret and flops on the ground, usually not even clearing his front end - the firing mechanism is a cute gimmick though, instead of a button or switch you pull back on the turret giving the illusion of recoil. lastly, but worst of all, are his arms in robot mode. the connecting pegs to hold his arm joints to the body do not work what so ever, they end up just resting on top of/next to his chest and given that it requires a great deal of force to move any of the joints in his arms, they just rise up out of place every time you try to move it. i almost cried when i discovered this. it's due to the complicated engineering of the tank turret, to allow it to turn side to side in tank mode, it just got too complicated carrying that over into robot mode and it practically falls apart (i can even see many arms snapping off, the joint is just way too snug and there's so little mass where his shoulder connects to his chest that the plastic could easily break if you weren't careful). he would have been brilliant if it weren't for this, i could forgive the stupid feet, i could forgive the cheap nose-cone, but there's 0 chance of having an enjoyable experience moving his arms. he looks so great, pays a wonderful homage to the original design from the 80's while updating it to be a better, more detailed, more durable form but it all falls apart when you want to move his arms. i loved this character and jumped out of my seat when i saw a preview of him, at last, an honest attempt at a functional triple changer that doesn't lack in detail, and one of the cooler triple changers to boot! the face flipping gimmick even works! but the moment i got him out of the box and the body flopped down as i held him by his arm my heart sank. don't buy this, even if you're a collector, i'll still display mine, but i'll regret dropping the cash on him. i absolutely hate saying that about a transformer, one of my favorite ""things"" in the universe, and the ""generations/universe/classics"" line used to be superb (classics starscream is my favorite toy ever), the goal is admirable and wonderful, but lately they've just been frustrating, i hate seeing this line decline like this.",Negative,Negative,0.98609734
"before i begin, i fully expect any and all dealers to mark this post as ""unhelpful"" because i am going to tell you all the truth about this figure; and the truth is blitzwing is not a very good toy. blitzwing is a triple changer, meaning he has three different alt modes - a robot, a tank, and a jet fighter. trying to cram these features into one figure has always been a challenge for hasbro, going all the way back to the classic g1 days, and unfortunately this figure shows the struggle the design team had.the robot mode looks very nice, but the shoulders are constantly an issue as they have this weird double hinge to make the transformation feature work. the pegs used to keep them in place is way too small, and as a result? every time you go to move his arms, they pop out of position and it looks horrible. the way you can change faces by flipping them underneath the helmet is very cool, but that alone doesn't save the robot mode from being problematic.the jet fighter mode is reminiscent of jetfire, but again, the pegs are too small to keep everything in place and once you try to handle it? things start coming out of place and ruining the look of the toy.the tank mode is probably the best of the three modes, but it pales in comparison to warpath (who had a great tank mode) or even galvatron (who had a so-so tank mode).the transformation is not too difficult, but may be an issue for some due to the instructions lacking detail. finally? as i stated with my springer review, this figure is way over-priced. if you can find it at retail, it goes for $22.99 - almost twice what the asking price is on here. in all honesty, i can only recommend this figure to hard-core transformer fans and even then, he's best left on the shelf as a display piece. i wanted to like this figure, but couldn't. disappointing.",Negative,Negative,0.99316144

"i dunno, how many years have they been making these robotic elmo toys now? the first tickle me elmo was a hit because it was a novelty item (and at a time when kids were not glued to smartphones and tablets 24/7 and actually enjoyed life as live persons). in the years since i've bought or received 3 or 4 of them and it seems they never figured out how to improve the toy.like all fisher-price toys, this one was tied down with a lot of ties and tape so it was a super-pain to remove the toy from packaging, especially when an eager 4-year-old was waiting on the sideline. the toy requires 4 aa batteries which are *not* included, so i had to hunt those down in my tool boxes. opening the battery apartment is a super pain in the you-know-what... definitely the worst implementation of all these mechanized elmo toys over the years. the compartment door is laid in such a way that it's ridiculously hard to open. i started hating this toy before elmo even gave me his first hug.we finally got the batteries installed. the switch can be turned on to play or sleep; in the latter mode, elmo sings a lullaby and falls asleep. the play mode is the one where he gives you hugs. the hug mechanism is triggered when his chest is pressed, such as when a child hugs elmo. annoyingly, the motors and gears inside elmo make tons of noise when he moves, and the way he moves his arms really creeps my 4-year-old and myself out. i highly recommend you not give this toy to your younglings on a rainy night...so this elmo tries to talk funny and also sings. luckily he doesn't laugh hysterically as much as he used to. the motor noise still overwhelms the talking and singing volume much of the time, so it's still difficult to hear what he says or sings as in the past.  another creepy thing is, in play mode when you lay him down flat on his back (don't try laying him on his stomach!), he's supposed to sing and then go to sleep, but he'll hold his arms out in a weird way, like he's trying to grab your kid and run or something.btw this toy is quite small and the whole constructions feels cheap.",Negative,Negative,0.9895173

"i received this product through vine but that probably won't be reflected here (i wrote to amazon about our issue). our skateboard is a dud and we can't get a replacement. but i think our review is relevant so i'm doing it anyway.my daughter has every fur real toy except the very large horse. she was extremely excited about this cute pup. she still intends to play with the puppy but its feature as a skateboarding pup is non-existent.the pup itself has a hard plastic body without a cuddly padding, which could have been used in the design. the ""fur"" is loose over the plastic form, which bends to do different ""tricks"" on the skateboard. the dog itself requires no battery. the ""30+ tricks"" are due to the poses of the dog, including popping up its ears.the skateboard remote (ours works and barks) makes the board go around or forward. only the back wheels are controlled by the remote, as well as a pivoting wheel that's hidden. the front two wheels are decorative. they spin but aren't controlled by the remote.the dog's velcro (soft side) paws attach to the velcro (rough side) strips along the skateboard. it would be simple for even young children to attach trixie to her skateboard.the problem with our skateboard... well we don't know. the red light lights up and then fades. the wheels don't respond to the remote at all. we tried several batteries and held the remote all distances from the skateboard. all it did was light up and immediately fade.this could have been a really adorable toy if only the skateboard worked. unfortunately i have a disappointed child and a broken toy. she still wants to play with the puppy and she'll push the skateboard around, which is fine for having gotten it for free. but if you're thinking of buying this toy, you might want to get a different fur real friend for your child.",Negative,Negative,0.8711962

"my son is well below the recommended age for this, but we planned it as a family project and he has a strong interest in science and experimenting and building things, so we thought it would be right up his alley. well, he was definitely interested but the process was disappointing for all involved.for the suggested price of this kit, i was a little surprised so much is not included. you need a 9v battery (which, granted, isn't that big of a deal) to make anything work, plus many others require extra elements you may or may not have on hand at any given moment. and many of the direct projects require other household items and specific tools we didn't necessarily have to do them (wire strippers and crimpers recommended for many things, special tweezers, etc.).i was more disappointed with the build quality of the materials that were included. cheap, flimsy cardboard punch outs compose the body of all the projects. expect them to last mere minutes after completion. we also found the wire very frustrating to work with, even as adults.  it broke easily and frequently was unstripped, even when it was supposed to be, so that had to be done (a finger cutting, not-fun job since we don't own professional strippers) before you could even begin to design anything. one of the circuit board pieces was also broken--though still could be used--in our kit, and several others badly bent. like everything else, they too are cardboard, and prone to tearing.on the plus side, the instruction booklet was well-illustrated--even my six-year-old could easily follow it and understood all the steps--and the basic concept of circuitry is well illustrated by the projects here. just don't expect to do anything other than build them and then immediately take them apart; and not only because you only get one of each part in this kit.

"the content in this package is largely made up of cards of cardstock quality - even printed on one side. the cards in this package fell apart even before the box was opened.  it would take very little effort to make these same kinds of things - especially the fingerprint cards that are -five square boxes with decoration.  the `crime scene' cards have a cm/inch scale and a color scale.  what is most interesting about these though, is that they ask you for information about what you see, which is a good exercise in every day life.  i have often done this with writing exercises with children.  i make xeroxs, though.the quality of the other items is like dollar store quality items.  they are plastic and will be extremely short lived.  they are not the quality shown in the booklet by any stretch of the imagination - which is what you would need to use them anyway.most of the content is in a 32-page pamphlet.  the story is about a csi agent and the `experiments' are about gathering evidence.the experiments require other items that are integral to the experiment.  for instance, if you would like to determine the time of the crime, the materials from the kit are: insect card.  the other items you will need to provide are several tins of cat or dog food, plastic bags, stopwatch, notepad and pencil.this is not the quality of product that i have seen in the past from ravensburger, although admittedly, my experience is largely of their puzzles, which are of good quality and last for hours of fun.  this is disappointing.",Negative,Negative,0.7457112
"i'm a bit confused about the age limit on this product - and the stern warnings to stick to it.  the warnings would practically have you believe that any child under eight who so much as looks as this product is in imminent danger of spontaneous combustion or something.  but having looked through the activities, i'm hard-pressed to find anything terribly dangerous or very much different than the science kits i've been doing with my older daughter since she was five (she's now seven) and now with my younger daughter is who almost five.  in fact, i'm doubtful that children much older than eight would find this kit terribly entertaining.there is an interesting variety of activities in this kit, which run the gamut from intriguing to rather lame.  the first activity, for instance, involves collecting samples from the ""crime scene"" into collection bags.  except that there is no crime scene.  we don't even know what the crime was or what we're looking for.  i guess kids are just supposed to use their imaginations and make something up, which is all well and good, but it's rather confusing the way it's presented.  so basically you just end up using tweezers to put bits of carpet fiber or other debris into small baggies.other activities involve looking at prints and tracks - fingerprints, bicycle tracks, footprints, imprints of keys, etc.  some of these activities could be interesting and educational for kids.  my older daughter enjoyed only two activities we have done, the footprint mold (but there was barely enough plaster to fill the mold even very thinly) and the key mold (again, hardly enough dough in the kit to make a good impression).one activity involves opening cans of dog food in different areas under different weather circumstances and looking for fly larva.  you'll want to do this one outside.  on the other end of the messy spectrum, one activity involves looking at a card with a ""before"" and ""after"" picture of a crime scene in order to note the differences and choose the right suspect.the most intriguing activity deals with isolating dna, but it's also the most involved activity.  it requires ""methylated spirit"" (the one component that would have been very helpful to have provided is, of course, not provided) as well as a number of household items and several complicated steps.my biggest complaint with this kit is how little it contains.  you could do most of the activities with common household items and a trip to the hardware store.  the items which are provided are largely inadequate and/or flimsy (which is quite disappointing, as durability is usually one of ravensburger's hallmarks).  it's handy to have all the activities assembled in one kit, but it might have been better had they expanded the instruction book into a longer and more free-standing book, since most of the other materials in the kit are easily obtainable.  as it stands, i really can't recommend this kit.",Negative,Negative,0.9070211
the kids excitedly opened this when it arrived and their enthusiasm was quickly deflated.  this is extremely overpriced!.  cheap paper items abound in this kit.  the so-called dough is miniscule.  the magnifying glass is miniature.  contents do not live up to what is on  the box or how the product is described online.  if you google forensics for kids you will find many better activities that you can do--most of which can be done with regular household items.  save your hard-earned money.  this was very disappointing.,Negative,Negative,0.99935013

"before i go any further, i've uploaded several pictures of the set which will do more to review this product than anything i can write, but here are the basic outlines...when you first look at this set, the notion of a grocery store with 100 different items sounds like a dream (once you stock the shelves, of course). in some ways, it is, if you're training your 3 y.o. for a future career as a grocery store stocking boy/girl. this set has it all, from milk cartons, to canned food, to pretzels, to fruit, along with the shelves and bins to stock. of course, that's where the trouble begins. if you buy this toy for at least the younger audience (i.e. 3-4 years olds), prepare to spend a lot of your time stocking the shelves, since the items are small enough and require enough precision in placement that a younger kid is going to have a tough time. if your idea of a good time is spending 10-15 minutes every ""shopping trip"" putting item on the shelves for your child to spend 10-15 seconds taking them off, then get this. now. but wait, there's more! you might think that a product with 100 life-like grocery items would come with the labels already applied. that bottle of syrup? why, wouldn't it make sense for a manufacturer with access to machinery that can perform thousands of repetitive-but-high-precision acts a minute to use that machinery to pre-apply all the neat labels to the items? you might think it would, but alas, the manufacturer of this set thinks differently (then again, it's made in china, so maybe they don't have the machinery, just hundreds of poor workers who can only apply stickers so fast). instead of getting 100 pre-labeled items, you get 100 generic items with 100 stickers the size of your fingernail to apply. those cereal boxes that go on the shelf? think they're little plastic boxes with stickers? nope! they're cardboard punch-outs the size of stamps that you get to fold like origami to make for little shopper hands to immediately crush. but perhaps you're the type of parent who enjoys spending hours applying micro-stickers to micro-plastic grocery items, and then setting them on micro shelves. if so, this set is for you, but you better check with your vacuum cleaner first, because half of these are gone the first time you run it through your kid's room.in short, if you are a family of chipmunks (or absolutely must add a grocery store for a family of chipmunks to your collection), this set if for you. if you are human, and have any sort of time constraints, it is not. it's sad too, because had this come from the factory pre-labelled, it might have been the coolest thing ever. but insofar as the manufacturer would rather *i* pay *them* $70 to apply my own labels than pay their own factory workers to do it, i really have to knock this way down. at first, i was going to say i couldn't in good conscience take off 3 stars for this, but then i realized the set costs $70. at $30, i think it might be worth the labor on my end. at $70, it's laughable to get a box with two sheets of stickers and two sheets of origami cereal boxes.ps just in case the manufacturer is reading this, apply the labels and assemble the cereal boxes at the factory, and you've got a 5-star set on your hands.",Negative,Negative,0.88906074

"bejeweled: 2-4 players, ages 8+, average play time = 15-30 minutesfirstly, i must commend the game for having some pretty eye-catching components, namely the gems.  in all honesty however, that's where my accolades end as far as the components are concerned.  the box, in my opinion, is poorly shaped and made.  my game did not come with a bag as the manual suggests.  the gems and chips came in non-zip baggies that did not function well at all as storage devices.  i opted to use a large zip baggie for the gems and a small zip baggie for the chips.  the game is certainly pretty enough, but the quality of the components and storage devices leave much to be desired.setting up the game can be problematic, as you'll have to ensure there are matches available from the get go in order for play to go smoothly.  gameplay is a bit more streamlined, but can be a bit random.  since players are pushing gems away from them to fill slots, it can be hard to predict how the board may end up by the time your turn rolls around again.  when i play match-3 games on the pc, i at least have some control over the board and can set up chains appropriately.  the rules themselves could use more work and be a bit clearer, especially when players can't make a match.  for example, i personally don't think it's fair to replace the four center gems randomly and then not be able to move to make a match, if one existed.  luckily, we had the ability to play how we wanted since the game seemed flexible enough to allow it.overall, i could only really recommend bejeweled to families who like casual games.  it's hard to develop any sort of strategy in this game as you never know what your opponents will do on their turn.  i liked how flashy the pieces were, but disliked the way they were packaged.  it's almost like the developers put all of their money into making the gems look good but ran out when it came time to produce everything else.  the lack of a bag in my copy rubbed me the wrong way.  to sum this up, bejeweled isn't bad, but i've seen better.  the game came with an exclusive download code for bejeweled 3 on the pc which was worth $19.99 on pop cap's site, so i suppose the purchase was worth it in a round-about way.  on the other hand, the code itself is good for one download only and expires 12/31/13.  really?  one download?  try harder pop cap...",Negative,Negative,0.63527787

"i actually never give this less rating for any lego product. but i had no choice. the reason for my disappointment with this set can be expressed in one word....""speedorz"".first, i'll start with the good things in this set. you get the laval, prince of lion tribe and cragger, prince of crocodile tribe minifigures. both are the two most important characters in chima story. the two minifigs are, needless to say, awesome! the best thing about the chima theme is the minifigures.this set contains some decent set-pieces. the lion's mouth-kind-of-arch is very well designed and looks nice. one small chi tower is cool.now coming to the thing i despise the most about this set..speedorz. the main problem with these speedorz is that they wobble , most of the time, while moving. the reason for that, i'm guessing, is because of a design-flaw. the front wheel is bit heavy and the back portion of the speedor is very light. hence the wobble. sometimes, adding an attachment to the back does help, but sometimes it doesn't.i had a tough time trying to make the speedor move in the way shown on the back of the box and as mentioned in the instruction manual. also, whenever the speedor used to go up the ramp, it used to land upside-down! so more chances of damage to the minifig there.what lego should have done , is that, apart from the big wheel in the front, there should have been two small wheels in the back, for balance and stability. then the speedor would have moved very nicely. i personally feel that if lego doesn't change the design of the speedors soon, people might reduce buying it. from what i've seen on the internet, not many are very happy with the speedorz.so, if you are a die-hard fan of lego, who wants to buy everything and anything and lego, then please go and buy this. else, you can happily exclude this set from your shopping list. in case you want the minifigs, you can get them in other chima sets. laval comes in ""laval's royal fighter"" and cragger in ""cragger's command ship"". those sets are expensive than this one but they are definitely worth the money!",Negative,Negative,0.7431191

"our 5 year old daughter loves lego friends. she first saw them at a friends house and was instantly obsessed with them. we purchased a set for christmas and it was a big hit. we got this little set for her to expand her collection and she loves it.the lego friends water scooter fun set is one of those small sets in a little hanging box with only 28 pieces (it probably should have been sold as a lower priced bagged set due to the small number of pieces). it includes the kate character. it also includes a water scooter/jet ski vehicle and some beach/swimming accessories. the instructions are very detailed and easy to follow for a 5 year old. the recommended age is 5-12 and a 5 year old will only need minimal help with it.obviously this is a smaller set that you usually find on an end cap at your store hanging on a hook. you shouldn't spend more than $6-7 for this (which is the msrp you can get it for on the lego web site). some secondary amazon merchants sell this set for $10 or more which is in no way worth it. you pay more per piece for these little sets, but for $10 you can easily find 80-100 piece lego friends sets on amazon. this particular set is very pricy due to the very small number of pieces, so be aware before you buy.  this size set should be purchased at your local store if you can find it, not on amazon for double the price. if you can't find it elsewhere and amazon is your only option, please be sure you know what you are getting in this very small set.  make sure to shop around.long story short, this is an ok addition to your lego friends collection, but it really isn't worth the $7 msrp.  you should really only get it if you think the unique pieces are worth the higher per piece price.  there are better sets available in this price range.  regardless, it would make for a nice stocking stuffer.",Negative,Positive,0.46254236

'spirograph' is an excellent, classic, and amazing past-time, but this current release is a far cry of what it used to be, quality-wise.  then again, companies cheapening or 'watering down' quality is so utterly prevalent in today's times, whether it be food, toys, music, and many other products!  america is not what it used to be.  sad, but true.",Negative,Negative,0.6440673

"i have been hoping that nerf would introduce a dart gun like this -- a compact non-bullpup configuration of flywheel-based dart gun.  i really wanted to like this thing!first the good things...--comfortable to hold, balanced well enough that you don't immediately develop wrist fatigue holding it.--feels solidly built -- no creaking sounds when holding or firing it.--the motor spins up quickly enough that you can realistically fire a dart after only a short delay to rev up the flywheels.--the rear part is compatible with stocks from various other nerf dart guns, which provides a bit of flexibility.now the bad things -- oh, so many...--frequent jamming, in the sense that the main trigger sometimes cannot be pulled to fire a dart, even when there is a full clip of darts in place -- after testing all sorts of combinations of old and new darts with both old and new ammo clips and ammo drums, i can honestly say that it does not matter whether you use old or new darts, and it does not matter whether you use old or new clips/drums (i even had a jam with its own 6-dart clip and the 6 darts that came with in the box in place) -- this thing just loves to jam up more than any other dart gun i've ever tried.--speaking of jamming, the jam door looks tantalizingly like it provides good access to where the darts are taken off the top of a clip and pushed into the location of the flywheels, but when you open the nice big jam door, you find an all-too-narrow opening underneath it -- it is actually the most constricted access for clearing jams i've ever seen on a nerf dart gun -- why?--nerf clearly intended the front part of this dart gun to be compatible with the various barrel extensions that have been offered on other nerf dart guns, but i can confirm that the barrel extensions from the retaliator and the recon both wobble in place after being attached -- this simply shouldn't happen, given that nerf is the designer and manufacturer of all of these different parts -- the pieces should fit solidly together.--the clip-release button is in an awkward place facing towards the trigger grip and it doesn't fully release the clips when used -- the stampede and alpha trooper have very nice and easily-used slide-controls on each side to allow operation with a finger of the trigger hand while that hand is still on the trigger grip, and the clip smoothly falls out when released -- on this dart gun, the clips stay stuck in place such that they need to be pulled out, and operation with a finger of a trigger hand still holding the trigger grip requires an awkward-feeling outward push of a finger of the trigger hand.then there's a pet peeve i have about all of the flywheel-based foam dart guns i've ever tried...  why can't nerf or anyone else offer a flywheel-based dart gun with quiet motors -- is it really necessary for these things to be so loud?  i presume it's a cost issue -- louder motors cost less than quieter ones.  however, i would actually be willing to pay considerably more to have a flywheel-based dart gun that was actually quiet when revving -- and i don't think i'm alone!so far, it appears that modding this dart gun is the only way to solve the jamming problem -- but it shouldn't be necessary to do such things!this could have been the ""end-all"" of clip-type flywheel-based dart guns, but the annoyances are all too many.  if you want an ""elite"" series flywheel-based dart gun, i highly recommend the new ""elite"" version of the rayven (which was released pretty much side-by-side with the stryfe).  i've almost never had a jam on either the old all-green version of the rayven or the new blue-and-white ""elite"" version.",Negative,Negative,0.9256407

"looking at the box, i thought this would be a fun set to build awesome robots to play with. upon opening the box, my opinion quickly changed. whoever created this, was slightly insane, i think.the pieces are made of foam. they are in sheets and you pop all of the pieces out. there are a bzillion pieces that need popped out and some are soooo tiny. when i say tiny, i mean only a few millimeters  - there are some tiny little ones that are just barely 2 millimeters wide and about 4 millimeters long. some are tiny flat pieces and some are little cylinder shaped pieces and yes, they are meant to be used in building the robots and adding to the gun.i would never buy this for a 4 year old, although the age range on the box states that as the youngest of the age range. it is much too overwhelming. 8 & 10 year old nephews totally gave up on it quickly as well. it takes forever to pop out all of the pieces, for one thing. luckily that is a once and done deal. assembly takes just as long and is not very fun to do.it seems to take a million pieces just to make one figure and it ends up not being sturdy enough to play with anyway. my 15 year old daughter actually joined in and finished assembling all 3 figures as per the box and instructions. she did it mainly because she tends to be a very determined individual and she was enjoying the ridiculousness for some odd reason.to make the eyeballs, you have to insert tiny black rivets into the white balls. the joints (red) and eyeballs (white) are fairly small. smaller than the smaller sized gumballs.i thought this set would be more like construx type playsets  - a little more sturdy, with easy to handle & assemble pieces. this is nothing like that at all. i appreciate the fact that the pieces are soft. i don't even know how many times i've stepped on a lego and cursed under my breath, so the soft pieces are a nice alternative in general, but the plethora of pieces and especially the itty bitty pieces is just too much. if it was slightly more sturdy and allowed for playing with the figures after assembly, i would rate this set much higher. the colors are bright and fun, and the idea of the types of figures are great - robot, space gun, etc - but the set as a whole just does not come through and could not hold any of 3 boys' attention long enough to complete a figure. all 3 boys were in the recommended age group and none of them seemed to be impressed with the set at all. once my daughter did finish the figures, the boys thought they looked cool, but were disappointed that they couldn't really play with them because pieces would pop off and fall off.",Negative,Negative,0.90639246

"i bought this item for my son so that he could better enjoy our extended wooden railway system. before this, all his trains were manual operated wooden ones, including several from the thomas and friends team. however as soon as opening the pack, the disappointment started and now i have to return it back after a day of experiencing it.however before listing my complaints, i have to say that it is a good replica of  thomas, a good quality craftsmanship exist in the way it was built and paint. yet, i believe that it is the only plus on this item's side.what concerned me first was that it was pretty heavy for a toy. it weighs 5.40 ounces without battery and 6.18 ounces with the battery included. the wooden no-battery thomas, we have, is 1.95 ounces which is less than 1/3 of this one this one is pretty dense due to its metal construction and this is the main reason behind the weight difference since the dimensions of the wooden one are only a little smaller than the metal one (this one).its heavy weight is a disadvantage in its motion capacity. it can not move fast and struggles in most parts of the track even totally stopping at most places. so it never offers a smooth ride for the child (tried with two different fully charged batteries). moreover an item this heavy and dense which also has non-rounded edges (due to the original shape of the train) is pretty dangerous for a toddler to play on its own. imagine one child hitting a playmate with this toy, or throwing it to wall or glass, all sorts of nasty things can happen therefore, despite its good material quality, i would prefer a cheaper but safer construction for peace of mind.another disadvantage is how the wheels work. they do not grab the track well can not make smooth turns and struggle to keep the train on track. the front and the back wheels are battery powered and there is no way they move without the battery, so this toy can not be used as a manually operated one without the battery. i would keep it no matter what if there was a possibility to play it manually but as it is it only fits to a museum for demonstration purposes.for the $14 price tag and the fisher price brand name backing this product, i surely expected a better performing toy but thanks to amazon there is always a second option which is sending this back straight away...",Negative,Negative,0.589383

(the only sound effects are the sounds of cheap plastic parts moving.) alternatively, one can swing the toy boom camera against the screen (with an action figure in front of the screen or not), which if swung with sufficient force, flips the screen back and causes the set to collapse. i found this entertaining for about 10 seconds, though my grandson got at least 15 minutes of fun playing with the set before getting bored. we have way more fun building towers out of wooden blocks, then knocking them down. sometimes we put action figures on top of the block towers before toppling them or my grandson will launch an action figure at a block tower by tossing it with his hand.i cannot recommend this toy.",Negative,Negative,0.99234116

"my three year old got this as a gift. cute, but it's very limited. yes, it's fun to see the dolphins swim around her at full speed, but once you get past that barbie doesn't (can't) do anything. her shoulders are jointed but they must stay in one position for the dolphin action. her hips are not jointed and she can't walk or even stand (which really makes no sense - unlike most barbies, her feet are flat - so she can't wear barbie shoes - so you'd think that standing would be easier. with her flippers on she can stand, but don't blow on her.) tonight we tried her in the bath. the instructions say she needs 9&#34; of water, which is true - she'll then float in a standing position. but 9&#34; is twice the bath water we usually use. aside from the wasted water, it's a safety issue. finally, if you turn the knob for the dolphins while she's in the water, the dolphins will turn one way while barbie will slowly turn the other as she tilts to one side, eventually coming to rest with her face in the water. some dolphin trainer :). then you take her out of the water and realize that there's still some energy left in the spinner, so the dolphins spin full speed and spray you. okay, so that was the most fun we had, but i'm not sure it was intended to do that.",Negative,Negative,0.9850928

"you want me to tell ya a story, hon?

(chuckling) yes, this so-called friend does sound a lot like _____...yes, she did have a party recently. yes, everyone is supposed to have a go at the pinata- not just the birthday girl and her cousin, the one other child guest besides you. we call that ""nepotism"". but that's a story for another night. anyway, this little girl threw caution to the wind and plunked down barb in her suction cup chair. the chair stayed put, but when the coloring action took place, barb was fallin' all over the place. the seat needs a restraint. i say...putting paint chips in a clippy-thingie and trying to pull it down a lock of barb's wet hair is difficult and dosen't even work! just using the included brush on the chips themselves and then transferring the color to barb's hair is much easier. she sure did shed like a dog! keep her away from the couch. no, sweetie, that's not a chamber pot- that's to hold the water in order to get barb's hair wet. i do think that the coloring clip can be used to keep several pieces of paper together. it's not a total waste. you want another story? how about ""the pretentious fellow target customer""?  or: ""the girl who cried anti-hipster""? i know- ""the insecure neighbor who redecorated her kitchen instead of capping off her abandoned well and whose child brought over a terrible hairtastic barbie""! perfect.",Negative,Negative,0.9706224

"i ordered the barbie fashion design plates doll to play with my granddaughters. their mom and i had spend many hours playing with the old fashion plates toy and this looked very similar with the added fun of a real barbie and designs she could really wear!first off, this toy is very difficult to open. the box had to be opened on the top and the bottom and pried apart. all of the individual pieces had to cut off. even the doll's head is anchored 5 times. it was very annoying.the doll is adorable,(which is why this toy earned 2 stars) the new barbie style, which is important in the crazy world of trying to buy barbie clothes that fit. she has jointed knees, the trademark silky blonde hair, a pink sparkly dress and super cute shoes. (said the 7 yr old) her hands are molded outward which could make dressing her harder than it should be. (we've had problems with those hands on other barbies)she is really, really lightweight, which i found odd.there are 6 double sided design plates; 2 bodices, 2 midsections, 2 skirts. they fit into a very thin, flimsy, dress form shaped frame.the idea is that you chose the three pieces of your dress and load them into the frame. then the dress slides over the frame. next is a dress form shaped piece of paper coated with tailor's chalk, then the top of the frame. lastly, you rub it with a small plastic tool to transfer the chalk to the dress. that's the theory.in actuality, the dresses are hard to pull down over the form, one isn't long enough to get the bottom of the design, the shape of the chalk coated paper is just big enough for the frame so when you rub it, it squishes up, the chalk doesn't transfer well so the designs are poorly shown on the dresses. even the dress forms included to insert into the dresses so you can color them are cardstock, instead of cardboard. the markers don't allow for detail work and the stickers don't stick!i was trying to relive our happy fashion plates memories. instead...remember ""rub ons""? this toy is very similar, even down to the ""pull up an edge, check it, put it down and rub some more"" feature.sorry, barbie, this is an epic fail!",Negative,Negative,0.99441105

"my 3-year-old graddaughter loves her barbies. if this toy were a basic barbie with a couple of fashion accessories at a reasonable price, i'd have rated it much higher.unfortunately, it's touted as a ""fashion design"" doll, meaning that you also have the opportunity to ""create"" your own fashions, in this case a couple of dresses.even that would have been great, as my munchkin loves to ""design"" those kinds of things for her dolls. disney has a very fun line of this kind of thing for the princess dolls and figurines.but that's where this toy doesn't meet the mark. first, it only includes two dress ""blanks"". that's a very limited repertoire. the included pens for drawing designs on the blanks work, but the cloth of the dresses is pretty thin and flimsy, so it moves around a lot when she tries to color the dress.the pattern-maker element is also poorly designed. you're supposed to be able to transfer a ""chalk"" design onto the dress material by, essentially, doing a rubbing with an enclosed tool that looks like an ice scraper. it doesn't work worth a hill of beans. even with me, at 6'2"" and 200 pounds, putting my full force behind the scraper, the design was only dimly and vaguely -- and certainly unevenly -- transferred onto the dress. when my munchkin tried it, the results were almost completely undiscernable.then, once she was done ""creating"" her dress, it was time to put it on the doll. i gotta tell you, i have absolutely no idea how any kid is going to be able to do that. the dresses are extremely tight, and took a lot of manipulation of the doll on my part to get them on or off. you have to put barbie's arms upright (like she's diving into a pool) and angle her arms toward each other, all while maneuvering her head to try to get everything through the dress, the arms in the arm holes, wriggling everything the whole time while trying to work the dress over the figurine. i thought i'd need an extra hand or two to make it happen. getting it off was just as hard.not ready for prime time.",Negative,Negative,0.9523879

"after playing zombicide andzombicide season 2: prison outbreaka few times, i'm sorry to say i have to give it two stars (which on amazon means ""i don't like it"" very much).there is no doubt that the minis are awesome, and the fact that it is co-op is a major plus. i also liked this zombie mechanic better than the last night on earth zombie mechanic (i.e., zombicide zombies are dumb and move/attack using a predetermined algorithm, where as lnoe zombies seemed pretty resourceful and strategic given all the cards they can play to mess with the survivors).unfortunately, there were many things i also disliked. for example:(1) the targeting priority system does not make any sense to me. it is crazy that you have to attack other survivors first -- especially without a save. and, why would i attack the lowest threat zombie when there is a higher threat zombie standing right next to it? i wouldn't, but the game makes me!(2) it is very easy to run out of zombies, which gives those zombies you run out of an extra activation (an effect that is cumulative, and makes the game harder still). i have yet to play a game where we don't run out of one or more types of zombies on a regular basis.(3) some of the zombies are very hard or nearly impossible to kill. in fact, just about the only way to kill the abominations is with a molotov cocktail (of which there are only 2, and they are very hard to make as you have to find a glass bottle and gas card first, and make sure the same person has both of these cards).(4) survivors die way to easily. lots of people house rule this, but i would very much have preferred the survivors to have a fighting chance to begin with. and, there are not lots of ways heal in this version (so, once you take a wound it's hard to get rid of it... which is pretty bad since you only need two wounds to die).(5) the game is very random and requires very little skill (in fact, most of the decisions are very obvious). the zombies you draw are random, the equipment cards you draw are random (which is problematic since many of them are also useless), and while the zombies always hit, survivors must roll a d6 to see if they hit. and, as mentioned above, you cannot always chose what zombie you attack and are sometimes forced to attack a survivor before a zombie.on the one hand all this means it really has a chaotic zombie apocalypse feel to it (we all know the odds are against you in a zombie apocalypse). and, given that the game is so popular in general, the above issues are obviously not a big problem to many (and i mean no disrespect to those who love the game by saying any of this). on the other hand they made the game a bit boring since it doesn't involve much strategy and there is not much you can do besides search for better items that increases your chance of successful attack vs. a zombie you may not want to attack anyway. in short, the game just sort of happens to you and there isn't much you can do about it except try (and often fail) to hold out as long as possible. which wasn't very appealing to me.",Negative,Negative,0.7618478

very disappointing!  the fist thing we noticed was the lid of the box was broken.  then as we are doing the puzzle the paper has started to separate from the card board puzzle piece on several of the pieces.  one of the puzzles is missing a piece but has a double piece of the same picture.  my boys are 5 and love jake but they will not do this puzzle.  they even prefer a sesame street puzzle to this and they don't like sesame street.  the only reason i didn't give this one star is because the puzzles are still doable.,Negative,Negative,0.7735391

"my 9 year old daughter received this scooter for christmas last year, though she barely used it until august 2013.  it is now november 2013 and we feel we can give a truly realistic review of the scooter.  our daughter uses this to get to school. she rides a total of 2 miles total. she does not do stunts, she just scoots along on sidewalk. keep that in mind for wear & tear.yes it looks nice; she loves pink.  the audio system is truly cool and works great.  but, it is held on the t bar with velcro, so someone could swipe it easy! better yet, you can put it on any scooter or even possibly a bicycle.it is adjustable and is a good height for our 9 year old girl, who is very tall for her age, but at this point she will outgrow it in a year or less.  that's fine too.here are the issues with this scooter.  1. the deck is almost all plastic.  in less than three months it shows lots of scratches and wear.  2. grips are poor quality. originally it began to give her blisters. it also quickly went from pink to gray.  upgrade to udi, so i've been told. 3. the lock mechanism to keep the t bar straight easily loosens so while she is riding it becomes crooked.  dangerous!!!  same with the height bar lock. loosens all the time.  4. most important: the 'so called' breaking mechanism is a thin piece of white plastic! it snapped off while she was breaking after 2 months of use.  when i examined it i was so surprised to see how thin it was where it is attached to the deck.  no good!we are getting her a new scooter.it does not have the stamina for the price, comparable to others out there.",Negative,Negative,0.7408401
"i've read some negative reviews of diamond select toys, but they are usually few and far between. now i have my horror story for their products. i have ordered every star trek ship from diamond selects 2012/2013 release. this was the 4th one i received, and the most disappointing. the manufacturing quality of the ship is alright (not great), but the most disappointing thing was opening up the package and finding the ship extremely dirty. since the ship was packaged in the original diamond select box (not the display package, the from the factory box) i'm guessing that is how the ship was packaged. yes, the package isn't air tight, but i don't think this level of dirt could make it through the holes in the package. a damp cloth took some of the dirt off, but a lot of it is so caked on the scrubbing with a cloth won't clean it. the dirt build up in the ridges of the ship will be very difficult and require a lot of detail work to clean (if it can be cleaned). i purchased this for display, and it really isn't up to par because of this. if i had bought this for a child to play with (it is supposed to be a toy), i wouldn't be comfortable giving it to the child. who really knows what the black dirt and debris is?edit: so i just read a complaint about the dirt on diamond selects facebook page. diamond select replied saying it was a design choice to make the ship look weathered and not like a toy. so their weathering is poor enough that some of it can come off with a damp cloth, someone else said they used an erase to get a lot of it off. so it isn't just mine, they are all ""dirty"". poor design choice.",Negative,Negative,0.97087944
"as a teenager back in the late seventies, i was a really big fan of lynda carter in ""the new adventures of wonder woman"" television series on abc (later moved to cbs.)during my second sophomore year, we had 'career day' where we would dress up as the person we wanted to be like in a job. my grandpa, who was a truck driver, strongly urged against my wishes. he even suggested i go as lyle waggoner who played the part of major steven 'steve'  leonard trevor. however, i would have none of that and even my grandma had my back. she always had my ""back"" by washing it for me until i was nineteen because i couldn't reach it. grandpa  thought it was just too 'weird'.lynda carter as wonder woman was who i wanted be when i grew up.even after the tv show was cancelled, i would write letters to lynda carter about my ideas for the show if it came back and how i would help out wonder woman as her sidekick ((wait for it..)) 'fantasmo boy.' she would write me back with some pretty saucy stories on how she would thank me for my heroism. my grandma was the one who would mail off the letters.  lyda carter's handwriting was as similar to my grandma's writing as the type of perfume she wore similar to the way the letters smelled. it was all a happy coincidence that brought me as close to linda carter as i ever got.over the years, i have fancied myself as a wonder woman action figure collector. i think the figure has strayed pretty far off from the one true wonder woman, lynda carter. sure, cathy lee crosby played the part as well, but i do not recognize her. as a result, i just can not give this figure any more than one star.",Negative,Negative,0.8822148

"this particular fisher price idea--to create a way for babies and toddlers to play with your iphone apps without damaging precious electronics--seems like a smart idea.  in actual practical application, this particular design is a bit of a dud.first off, the case is certainly sturdy enough.  the book format with the toy rings attached is attractive and cute--a little unwieldy--but certainly good for keeping an iphone  safely tucked inside, away from drool, goo and other dangerous substances and behaviors.  however, securing the device inside is tricky:  even my husband had huge issues with unlocking the device to put his iphone in to use, and then unlocking it later to remove his phone.  this makes it really inconvenient when kids with short attention spans want to play with more than one app in rapid succession--since each time the phone has to be removed to change the game or activity.to be honest, my kids were less than charmed by this.  my nephew of a few months chewed on the toy but had no interest in the apps.  my daughter of two years tried to play with it a bit, but found the interactivity less than desirable.  it's hard to get the tracking to work well through the barrier.  she finally got frustrated and wanted to throw it--and we decided we really didn't need to test just how durable and safe this case was.  my 4 year old was entirely uninterested in playing the iphone apps with the case and preferred to use our desktop computer if offered the opportunity.great idea, not so great execution.shanshad ^_^",Negative,Negative,0.9678781

"i've been looking for something like this to protect my iphone from my 2 1/2 year-old grandson, who is iphone proficient (honest) and always wants to use my phone, but ends up accidentally deleting appointments from my calendar or contacts, or worse yet, calling that person that i haven't wanted to talk to in years :)i thought this case would help provide limited access to my phone, and protect it at the same time.  it does. kinda.the case is a heavy-duty plastic box made to look like a story-book with a handle that doubles as a teething ring.  frankly, if your baby is still teething, i doubt they'd be able to navigate the functions of the story book apps (which are free, but have to be downloaded from the app store).  if your baby is older, say 2 and up, the story book apps may still be interesting to them, but they can use the apps on your phone without this case.  about the only thing the case really offers is the ability to hid the home button, so your child can't leave the storybook app and access other areas of your phone.  the ""protective"" clear film that covers the iphone screen will keep it safe from baby drool and sticky fingers, but that's about it.  any sharp object a child might wield against it could easily cause damage to your screen.the ""interactivity"" that the case provides is that closing and opening the cover advances the story app to the next screen.  i couldn't get it to work. plus, kids who know about iphones can just touch the screen or swipe it and accomplish the same thing.putting the phone in and out of the case isn't easy, and you'll think you're going to break it with how hard you have to press it to close it until you hear the ""click.""big drawback, is you can't answer your phone if you get a call while the baby is using it.  unless you have a ""spare"" iphone with a data plan that you can devote as a toy for your child to use, this case is really unnecessary.bottom line is this is just a big plastic case to hold an expensive electronic item so kids can play a free app that doesn't require this case to use.",Negative,Negative,0.961798

"we own the original and played the star trek version at a friend's house. we found the star trek version to be very visually confusing. here are reasons why i recommend buying (or staying with) the original version of settlers of catan and not this game:1. the number circles show a radar type graphic with the numbers less likely to be rolled having a smaller radar area (sorry, i really can't explain it) that makes it much harder to tell the frequency when placing settlements/outposts at the beginning of the game. also the numbers are smaller if they are less likely to be rolled making it very difficult to find the 12 and 2 when gathering resources.2. the game pieces are all raised on little pedestal pieces. they are two separate parts, so you have to put them together before you can do anything with them (like a plastic champagne glass). i'd prefer simpler pieces. more importantly, they are tall and block the view of the board making it hard to see the numbers when gathering resources. also, they are plastic and look very delicate.3. the dice have really rounded corners, so it takes forever for them to fall when spinning on a corner.  for some reason the pips on the dice are different colors (one die has blue and the other has red). not important, just a little thing that i thought was silly and unnecessary.4. the &#34;food&#34; in the new game is yellow/gold and yet it does not correspond to &#34;wheat&#34; from the original game for building purposes. this really threw us off since we are so familiar with the original version.5. the development cards are too similar to the resource cards when looking at the backs. the backs should have been a different color and different graphic so that you can clearly see which cards are which.6. adding the star trek theme to the original game concept does not really enhance the game play at all. the only difference in game play is the addition of a set of cards that allow you to avoid or change certain elements of the game. for instance, one card allows you ignore the effects of a rolled 7, another allows you to move your star ship (road equivalent). my friends didn't even use these cards because they felt it was too complicated. if you already own the original, this one is not different enough to justify buying it.",Negative,Negative,0.58178467

"hasbro should be ashamed for selling this piece of junk!  gameplay is simple: each player controls a farm animal with the goal of being the first to eat all of his or her colored marbles.  animals are controlled via their tails, which when pressed down cause the animal's neck to extend and its mouth to open.  when the tail is released, the mouth shuts - hopefully capturing a marble of the correct color and sending it down the chute into the food storage tray.  play is supposed to be a frantic bout of tail-slapping fun.the main problem is that about 50% of the time when the tails are pressed they get stuck.  when this happens you have to reach around and manually lift up the animal's neck/mouth & pull the tail up.  it's truly ridiculous that the core mechanics of the game's play simply don't work.  in addition to this issue, the marbles that do get eaten often times get stuck in the animal's mouth & fail to travel down a chute into the food storage bin as they are supposed to.  again, simply unforgivable for such a simple game to fail on its core mechanics.these two issues alone make this game a complete exercise in frustration.  throw in storage design issues - the marble storage compartment with lid won't hold all of the marbles! - and you've got a real stinker.  shame on you, hasbro!",Negative,Negative,0.93792564

"i got this as a gift and never would have bought it myself.  it has no creative value, which is what little minds need the most in this age group.  you'd be better off getting some play-doh, sidewalk chalk or a cardboard box.  if you want vehicles, then something more open-ended like a steel tonka truck, a big bruder, or anything from the green toys line is much better.  i have a one-year-old and a three-year-old who both play with those constantly.this truck talks too much, doesn't move around as much as you'd hope, and it's so loud.  there is no volume control!  it's pretty annoying and frustrates the kids. please, please, please don't buy this. you can do better.",Negative,Negative,0.9877407

the toy looked like so much fun in the pictures but i was disappointed when i opened the box.  unlike other play tents that i've had in the past this one is very flimsy and doesn't stand by itself without some assembly in the form of extremely flimsy velcro.  my 3 year loves it but within 10 minutes of playing with it he was frustrated because it kept collapsing on him.such a great concept with awesome potential that is ruined by crappy engineering and low quality materials.  i wish i could return it but it was a gift.,Negative,Negative,0.99703157
"the nice part about this tent is that it folds out and assembles with ease, but that's where the positive statements end.  the material is the cheapest and thinnest canvas you could imagine.  you wouldn't buy a 99 cent reusable grocery bag made out of this stuff.  my 3 & 5 year old played with it for the first hour, and already punched an 8 inch hole in the front of the material.  also, it frequently falls over and folds flat.  putting it back up, and putting the velcro back together, gets annoying really quickly.  now, the kids do seem to enjoy it - they love the hoop, and they like that it's a boat shape.  i'm so glad this was a gift, though, because i would have regretted buying it from the moment i opened the box.",Negative,Negative,0.61041456
"the toy is super cute and say quite a few sayings when you press his hand, but his neck is broke right out of the box.  actually broke is not quite correct.  the neck is a stiff, but slightly flexible material to hold the thin neck and head up.  sadly, rather than extending the material into the body where there would be some support/material to hold the neck steady, they end the material right at the base of the neck so the head and neck then want to constantly tip over at about a 45 degree angle.  it will only get worse as the toy is actually played with.  for saving a few inches of material, they end up with a neck that wants to flop over.  the only good thing is that my kids did not see it first and i can return it.  it is so cute and looks and sounds just like stuffy on tv, but i am returning it.",Negative,Negative,0.998857

"i was excited about playing this game with my kids, but it turned out to be a disappointment.  like other reviewers stated, it is just too difficult to balance more than a few penguins on the boat before it tips over.  the most we put on was five, and they have to be clustered around the mast.  placing the penguins anywhere else on the boat results in immediate capsizing.the first day we played it a couple of times, but then they lost interest.  we tried getting it out again a few days ago, but my son did not even want to balance the boat on the wave.  he just wanted to place it flat on the ground and put the penguins on it.  needless to say, that is not very fun either.  on the positive side, the penguins are cute and probably will join the little people in pretend play, but the rest is probably destined to be recycled.",Negative,Negative,0.9927452

"so, what is this thing?  well, it's trying to be an iphone for kids.  it's a pretty sizeable device, actually - about 6""x9"".  the screen itself really isn't all that much bigger than one on an iphone 5, only with far less clarity and quality.  it has ""apps"" - with square icons to click on.  you can slide the screen to the left or right to get to more icon screens.  you can create a ""profile"" so when you use the device it has your photo/settings setup.  you can use this thing to play games that are on the device or cartridges you buy, you can draw/paint, you can take photos/videos, you can listen to music.all of that would be pretty fun if it wasn't such an unresponsive, slow, clunky device to use.-let's talk about that screen:  i, and my nephew, found it crazy unresponsive.  we had to press - over and over - on an icon to get it to work.  using your fingers won't work.  there is an included stylus, in the rear of the unit, but we all know that will get lost in no time.  they do include a second one with the device, but you know that will end up in a drawer and long forgotten.  the screen's display quality isn't all that great - and i'm sure they went cheap figuring it's just a kids' toy.  but kids today expect a lot from their toys - more now than ever.  when daddy's iphone can play elmo videos in seconds, waiting for this thing to load seems like an eternity.-let's talk about speed:  it's slow. slow to boot up, slow to load any apps - you quickly lose patience with this.  my 3 year old quickly learned to read ""loading"" because you see that screen a lot.  even using apps - like switching colors in the paint screen to taking a photo - it's just slow.  unresponsive.  laggy.  i can tell they got some deal on old processors from korea and jammed them into this thing.-oh don't get me started on the wi-fi capability.  again, here is where the device shows it's clunkiness.  to activate the wi-fi capability, you actually have to plug it in to your computer and download a program to your pc in order to activate / setup the wi-fi!!!  oh i was furious at that!  this is how i expect wi-fi to work on anything: you hit the wi-fi button, find your router and enter your password and boom, done.  but no - this thing wants you do download more crap to your pc (spyware, anyone?) in order to register the device and activate the wi-fi.  stupid.  stupid design.-typing on this thing is insane.  i tried the ""notes"" app and that video keyboard is impossible to use.  i can't tell you how long it took to type out 7 words.  it almost always chose the wrong letter when i pressed on it - even when the letter i wanted was highlighted!  it was maddening.-what bothered me a lot was that we had a cartridge plugged in, but the ""cartridge"" icon was dim, ie: it didn't ""see"" the cartridge!  so annoying.-this big clunky thing will quickly become forgotten by my nephew.  for now, i'll just let him still play with my iphone from time to time....",Negative,Negative,0.9968836
"last year i had the opportunity to review the original innotab, so i was eager to see if they had greatly improved things this year with the innotab 2s.  my kids always love playing with my ipad, so the idea of a little tablet with some kids games that i didn't have to monitor was quite appealing.  i was not pleased with the innotab overall, but i had high hopes for the innotab 2s.  the innotab 2s has many improvements over the innotab, but also has taken a big step backwards.the first thing i noticed is that the new innotab is smaller.  it still has a kick-stand on the back and a stylus sleeve, but there is now a hole in the stylus and a small attach point for a string to hold the stylus.  oddly enough, innotab doesn't give you the string, so you need to get one yourself.  there is also now a camera on the top that pivots for both self portraits and photos of other people and a microphone for recording sound.the innotab 2s is still a usb device controlled by software you install on your pc, but it now has wifi for downloading apps.  this permits your child to ""shop"" in the online store, put apps on a wish list, and then allows the parent to buy them later.  the act of your child shopping sends you an e-mail with their ""wishes"".  sadly, the wifi interface didn't work with my home network since i don't have ssid broadcast turned on.  even entering the name manually like i do on my ipad would not work, so i had to adjust my security settings down for the innotab to work.once i turned it on, i was also surprised because normally new hardware runs faster, but this one runs slower.  for the original innotab, it tooks 16 seconds to get to the login screen and a total of 42 seconds to get through both power-up and login.  the new innotab 2s takes 33 seconds to get to the login screen and 49 seconds to go from off to the home screen.  pathetic!  this is for a little kid who will get impatient and mash the power button wondering why it won't turn on.  why can't they implement a sleep mode or similar?  taking almost a minute to turn on just is not acceptable today.i was also hoping that there would be some improvement to the actual device games itself, but they are still fairly low resolution and slow.  most of them are not very educational, and repeat the same basic tasks over and over.  a few accelerometer based games are fun, as are the silly camera applications.  my kids had a great time playing with them, but there is a limit to what you can do with the device.  my kids tried one of the ebooks that came with the tablet (there is a free cartridge included), but navigation was hard because the interface was so slow.  this screen seems less sensitive to a finger than the original, so you really need the stylus.  many times my kids were not sure if they had clicked a button and it was ""thinking"", or if their click had not registered.  sometimes it took several taps with the stylus for anything to happen.  it was a frustrating experience compounded by the fact they still play with the innotab 1 and that one runs faster!let's talk cost of ownership.  the innotab 2s costs $100.  innotab rechargeable batteries plus ac adapter will set you back $30.  add another $20 for an sd card (not included).  you're up to $150 when you can get a kindle fire for $159.  each game cartridge is $25 and the downloadable apps range in price from $3-$7.  in other words, you can hit $200 really quickly.  but $200 will get you a kindle fire hd which comes with rechargeable batteries, more memory, far more free apps, and many apps that cost $1 (and turns on in a second).my conclusion?  i received this to evaluate, but i can't see myself wanting to even spend an additional $25 for a game cartridge when i know i can get better games on an inexpensive android tablet that will run faster and smoother (and for less money).  the only advantage of the innotab is durability, but other than that, i can't really recommend this device in today's world of inexpensive real tablets.  the low quality applications and limited capabilities might have warranted 3-4 stars if the device weren't so mind-numbingly slow.  every button you click requires a 10-15 second lag while it loads the next screen.  this hardware is well past its expiration date.  the durable plastic shell and form factor are great, but innotab needs to update their processor to make a kids tablet to compete in the modern world.",Negative,Negative,0.9079326

"master splinter seems like a difficult character to mess up.  he's a anthropomorphic rat in a (usually maroon) robe with some cool ninja weapons and a walking stick.  the mentor and sensei of the teenage mutant ninja turtles, splinter has always been a part of nearly every turtles toy line released.  he's usually been a cool figure, as well.  unfortunately, this version of master splinter is quite weak.  i'm disappointed by this figure, and if you have any expectations for splinter, i imagine you will be too. as always, here's my positives and negatives about this figure:positives:*the figure is painted nicely.  while the body paint is somewhat minimal, the face is extremely detailed, especially for a mass market toy aimed more at kids than collectors.*good quality here. the figure is not going to break, all the joints are tight, and everything works the way it should.negatives:*right off the bat, this figure neither looks like the master splinter we've always loved nor does he look like the master splinter on the new nickelodeon cartoon which this figure is based off.  actually. he doesn't even look like the splinter on the packaging which is really surprising. perhaps there was a mistake or paint swap in production?  we'll have to see if we ever find a corrected version on shelves.*splinter's package proclaims that he comes with a ""ninja arsenal."" that's a pretty odd way to describe his walking stick.  i'm sure splinter is adept at fighting with it, but i'm not sure anyone would refer to it as an arsenal.*splinter's tail is a separate piece that often falls off.  it's a little annoying.overall:while i find myself really liking playmate's new tmnt line, splinter seems to me the weakest figure of the bunch.  only one accessory, limited articulation, and a really bizarre look definitely don't help.  don't judge the rest of the figures by this one, but only pick splinter up if you're a completest or absolutely must have a master splinter for your collection.",Negative,Negative,0.9122714

"all children love elmo, and my 20 month old granddaughter is no exception. she would like any stuffed elmo no matter what.elmo says five phrases that are activated by squeezing the bottom of elmo's right foot--she quickly got the hang of this. but my granddaughter has the let's rock elmo, which is a superb toy where elmo plays musical instruments. listening to him say five phrases doesn't really compare to that for her.my granddaughter would like this toy even if elmo said nothing and was not dressed in a bathrobe. i think she's a little too young to grasp the significance of what he is wearing.bottom line: you can't go wrong buying elmo for a child. my granddaughter likes that this elmo is larger than another version that she pushes around in her toy carriage. but for her this ""special"" version is really nothing special.update november 26, 2012: i downgraded my original review from four stars to two stars because just two months after receiving this, elmo stopped talking, or at best says incomplete phrases. that is because the pre-installed battery has died and there is no way to replace it. so now this is just another ""silent"" elmo. a two month battery life, not to mention the inability to replace the battery, is ridiculous for a toy this price.",Negative,Negative,0.86151654

""elmo would feel better if you hold elmo's hand"" and the other three phrases.  five short phrases (including the sneeze!) wear thin quickly.but the big news is this, and i capitalize this because it is so important:  there is no way to replace the batteries when they die.  elmo will fall silent permanently once the pre-installed batteries wear out.  when i looked and found no way to replace them, i went back to the amazon page, and sure enough, even gund says it; ""parents should be aware that the feel better elmo does not have an on/off switch, and there is no way to change the pre-installed battery.""so here is cute elmo, who my little boy loves from sesame street, and one day fairly soon, he will lose his voice.  not that i love changing batteries on toys, but that is kind of disappointing!also important; elmo can't be machine washed, of course, due to the batteries that soon will be useless anyway.  his robe and the tissue box are secured tightly; you can only ""surface wash.""the chinese construction of elmo isn't bad, really, but why spend $27 or so for what amounts to a temporary version of a doll?  i like the idea of my little boy hugging elmo when he's not feeling well and getting ready for some rest, but as a toy, and even as a stuffed animal, this version of elmo falls short.  i can't really recommend it.",Negative,Negative,0.98200834

"this toy seems like such a cute idea.  as an adult, i think the turtle is adorable and love the idea of encouraging baby to crawl.  the problems are with the execution.  first, the music and voice is hardly soothing or encouraging.  it's quite loud and obnoxious.  i can live with loud toys, but it scared my six-month-old horribly.  she cried until i turned it off.  i think it's just too loud and high-pitched.  it would be great if you could turn the sound off but leave the crawling on, but alas you can't.  there is also no volume control.  my second concern is that this toy is quite hard.  i know it has mechanical parts, but the majority of the body is hard.  children are not going to be able to hug this toy, which children usually do, and i also worry about unstable crawlers and those who begin pulling up to walk stumbling and crashing into this.  the outside is soft, but there is not much cushioning over that heavy, hard plastic.  i don't think it would cause serious injury or anything, but it could definitely hurt.  i would not recommend this toy.",Negative,Negative,0.86628985

"this review is coming to you courtesy of my father, who would rather just give my kids gifts than spend quality time with them. o.k., here goes:ac:-hair is layered with that signature frankie glow- yes, it actually glows bluish in the right light.-earrings are on well...crystal blue with the mh skull.-clear neck plugs.-cotton dress has velcro at back, tulle edging at hem, net sleeves, and a small, metallic mh skull with polka dot ribbon at neck. dress is easy to deal with.-shoes are easy to get on and off, and they never fall off. so cute.-belt is soft plastic with a hanging ""chain"", metallic studs and a lightning bolt emblem. closes well.-silver stitching on portions of her arms and legs. painted on.-applied voltage feature works very well. easy for kids to engage. just push tummy button.-battery chamber is small and concealed.dc:-doll is heavier than her counterparts.-she cannot sit down. (not too bad, but do want to mention.)-takes batteries (three lr44's).-this frankie's head is made of a thin, hard plastic. it is totally different than the plastic that is used for the standard mh dolls. paint does not take well to it. ours has sections of missing paint at her top forehead, cheek, and nose. she came out of the box in this state.my daughter told me that this doll sports the classic/original frankie outfit. doll is fun, and you can educate your kid on electricity if she will sit still for a minute. however, i cannot give her more than two stars, as i am not happy that she is noticeably horrid. i suppose that i should look on the bright side (hee, hee) and tell myself that these defects make her more authentically ""steiny"". figures that my dad, the electrical engineer, picked this one. ha!",Negative,Negative,0.918548
"i cannot say that i am all that much into monster high and i probably would not admit it on the internet if i was.  so i left most of the testing of this product to my three daughters, 10, 7, and 6.when i took the car out of the box for my kids, my initial impressions were quite positive.  the level of detail on the vehicle was quite good for a plastic car.  there are various spooky details on various components.  the dash has a spider web inlay, the shifter and tail lights are gargoyles, and the steering wheel and wheel covers kind of has a medieval cross design.i gave it to my kids and by the end of the day, i had one of the girls come up to me and tell me that it broke already.  there is a seatbelt in the trunk/back seat area that holds the dolls in place.  that seatbelt broke completely off, so at this point the back seat is useless.the girls continued playing with it and at the end of the month, they gave me their list of pros and cons with the car.my girls loved the idea the car had a trunk where they could put the dolls' clothes and such.  they really liked the fact that the car could seat 4 dolls, assuming the seat belt did not break.  they also loved the detail of the car and really liked the shifter and the fact the car had cup holders.my girls were really disappointed in the fact the rear seatbelt broke.  they also showed me that when they put their dolls in the front seat, they sank way down in the car.  the seat belts in front were a bit tough to put on as well.my oldest daughter really liked the details in the car and she gave it 4 stars, deducting a star for the broken seatbelt.  my middle daughter was a bit less impressed by the details.  she also cited the broken seatbelt and gave it 3 stars.  my youngest daughter was much less forgiving about the fact the car broke.  she gave the car a 1 star rating.personally, i will give kudos to the details and the overall sturdiness of the car.  however, i can imagine a parent having to deal with a crying kid if they have the same thing happen to them as we did and having to deal with trying to return the toy and getting a replacement.  based on other reviews, i think our car breaking is an exception rather than the norm.  however, i cannot change the fact ours broke the first day.  the average rating of my kids would be 2.67 stars.  factoring in my opinion, i give the item 2 stars.",Negative,Negative,0.897782

"first of all i regret buying it but my son loves it. and a lot of the apps are very fun and full of great learning concepts but  i don't like 3 main things:1. the apps are too expensive - in reading reviews before purchasing this, i don't remember anyone mentioning how expensive the apps are. i can't figure out how this can stay competitive on a market like this with all the other tablet options for kids. on average most apps are like $7 versus $.99 for apps with an ipad. and you have to buy the apps constantly; actually you have to buy them like weekly because the kids go through the apps like a thirsty person drinks water in the desert. the apps should be $2-3 at the most.  some are $25! just robbery! capitalism at it's worst2. everything you need for the thing is, of course, sold separately.  it only runs on batteries for maybe 2-3 hours so either buy rechargeable ones or you are spending a lot in batteries every few days. the charger and the headphones and the case are all separate and each costs about $20 a piece. just robbery! thievery! if we are paying $100 for the gadget, everything should be included. by the time you pay for the device, the apps, and the attachments, you would have a brand new ipad. in fact, it's cheaper to buy an ipad and buy $.99 apps than buy this thing.3. this device does not have wi-fi. i knew it didn't when i bought it but didn't realize how burdensome it would be to constantly download things from my computer to this game system. it's like i'm spending more time downloading the software and apps that it's making more work for me and less fun for my son.",Negative,Negative,0.99725693
"we've had this device for a couple months now. my son (4 1/2) has been playing educational games on the ipad for years and really enjoys them. i was hoping this would take the place of the ipad, and he could have his own device to learn and play on. it didn't quite work out that way.the first month we had this my son didn't touch it at all. my husband was deployed, so i had my ipad 3, and my son had the original ipad all to himself. after my husband came home, i got the ipad mini, the first generation went to my sister, and now my son had to share the ipad 3. once that happened he started paying a lot more attention to leappad.right off the bat he complained about it being slow. obviously the graphics aren't as clear as the retina display ipad, but the reaction time is also slower, not to mention the smaller screen.the biggest problem with this though is the cost of the apps. some of them are outrageous! i purchased a jake and the neverland pirates app on the ipad for $2.99. the jake app on the leappad is $25.00! what do you get for $25.00? well, it teaches...number recognition...shapes...sorting & classifying...counting. you can get educational apps on the ipad that teach all those same things, but for a fraction of the cost (or free!). an expensive app in the apple store is around $4.99, and those are rare, but leappad 2 app prices start at $10 and go up to $25.00 (the cheapest apps i saw were for $5.00, and there were only two of them).overall, i just don't recommend this toy, especially if you already have an ipad that you don't mind sharing with your child. even if you don't have one, you're still shelling out quite a bit of money for a toy. $100 for the device, plus $10-$25 per app. then if you want a case for it, that's another $15-$20. it's a money pit. i recommend taking that money and applying it to a tablet the whole family can use.",Negative,Negative,0.941281
"update:  march 10 2013leapfrog has issued a software update for the leap frog connect software.  (this software is loaded onto your pc and is for interfacing with the leappad 2...downloading apps and so forth)after the upgrade, the software tries to ""tune up"" the device.  what it does is crash to leap pad 2 device; it locks up on the tune ups screen and the child cannot use the device at all.  multiple attempts and reboots do not fix the problem.  the company takes a while to get ck with emails and they are not that helpful.  given the money that the device costs and the extremely high cost of the simple apps, i'm very, very disappointed with this company and their products.original review:we bought this for our six year old boy and he really loves it so far.  it's hard to tell how durable this is going to be.  sound quality is decent.technical comments:video display... well it's not retina, let's put it that way.  it's about one tenth the resolution of an ipad, but decent enough for kids. and it's not a capacitative touch screen.  it's resistive.  they are cheaper than capacitative and don't work as work as well.  but again...adequate for kids.  it does function adequately, especially when used with the stylus.unlike the vtech product , this does not come with the capability of playing your own mp3 songs.  you have to buy their app ($5)...and it's extremely basic... cannot play or view by album or artist.  just a big jumble of songs alphabetically by song title.  not even icons or album art to help kids identify the music if they cannot read well.  simply put,  it sucks.my big gripe is that they preload this with relatively little software/ apps.  and to purchase them is incredibly expensive.  the cheapest app you'll find is $5...and there are just a few.  some are $10.  a lot are $25!!! for kids games?  the most sophisticated adult games on mobile devices are not even half that cost.  holy cow!  that's just ridiculous!  hard to feel good about this whole platform when it's obviously just preying off generous parents.  i would seriously consider getting an inexpensive android 7"" tablet and getting free or cheaper apps.  but its likely that most of those apps would not be quite as child friendly.  also we wanted to make sure there was no wifi on a six year old's device.  so...a compromise.  we'll let him buy apps with his allowance money if he wants.",Negative,Negative,0.99202466
"my nieces and nephews all got this device for christmas -- ostensibly for educational purposes but (by my observation) also as a means by which to pry them from their parents' ipads. the leappad2 has been a major disappointment for all of them. many of the thoughtful reviews here detail the flaws (and joys) of the leappad2. my complaints in brief follow:- for kids used to an ipad the leappad2 is clumsy and limited. it lacks the fluidity and intuitiveness of a grown-up tablet.- all of the leappad books and games are expensive, costing in the $20-$25 range.- there's nothing special or exclusive about the leappad games/books either. for example, a leappad  minnie mouse game costing $20 is available on ipad for a couple of bucks.-yes you can now download apps through a real computer but since the leappad2's memory is extremely limited you're mostly stuck buying -- and lugging -- cartridges.  in 2013 this seems primitive.- there are few leappad games or books for kids under 4. unfortunately the littlest kids are the only ones with any tolerance for this limited device. by the time a child is 6 (at least in my family)  a leappad is considered a ""baby toy."" if you think your investment in leappad is worthwhile because it's long-term you may be in for a sorry surprise.- unless you buy the $50 recharger  you'll be putting in new aa batteries every other day.- the screen is too small and low resolution to make art apps the glorious fun they are on an ipad.  kids are sorely disappointed.in conclusion, the leappad may have been an ingenious invention back when we were all using pcs and laptops. now that the tablet era has arrived it's simply sad. don't buy it. save up for an ipad or give your kids the less expensive larger-screen kindle fire. either are real investments in your kids. a leappad is just money set on fire.",Negative,Negative,0.99838173

got this for my almost 6 year old as he loves anything that requires building and anything angry birds related.  he is big into legos so he has a lot of experience following directions and building stuff on his own.  he knows better than to ask me as i am terrible with legos but i do try if he really needs me.  most of the time he goes to my wife for help!  this set looked promising when we opened it.  the directions are pretty clear for the most part but they seem to do a lot of steps within one specifc step unlike legos which will spread out something acorss a few more steps to better see what is going on.problems started arising when certain pieces wouldn't clamp together well enough without falling apart when adding other pieces.  the knex stuff just doesn't seem as well built as legos in this regard.  we tried for about an hour before my son just decided he was tired of playing with it and moved on to something else.  this is the first project he did not finish and i am fine with it because it was frustrating.  the only other time we had this much of an issue was with a chinese knock off legos we got in new hampshire at a train station in north conway.the one good thing that comes with this package are the characters.  those get played with but more like action figures rather than part of the overall set.,Negative,Negative,0.9315185

"i am amending my review again b/c as much as these swords are fun and really do suit our purpose, the quality is just awful. as i originally stated my son loves to pretend to be a pirate or a knight or a musketeer, etc.  these swords are the right solution for a play sword.  i was looking for something soft that wouldn't actually cause any real physical harm when playing.  we have tried inflatable swords and they just always get holes and deflate.  we have used other miscellaneous items around the house: fake play knives and spoons, cardboard tubes, plastic and wooden mixing spoons, etc.  they all worked ok for the moment, but the hard objects can hurt and the cardboard tubes just fall apart of course.  these swords are good in the fact that they are soft and they are fun b/c they really look like swords.  he loves them for that.  and there's enough that the whole family can join in playing.  i'm not worried about them doing any real damage either!  that's where the positive stops though. after just one hour of play all of the handles broke :(  they were exactly what i was looking for and they were inexpensive, so you can't expect them to last long anyway.  but, to only last that long is just ridiculous.  they could have increased the durability and quality by just extending the small plastic tube inside the sword down through the rest of the handle.  it stops just short of the handle and that's why they break.  there is nothing reinforcing the handle.  it's just foam.  so, of course, they will break easily.  especially the way boys play!  after purchasing these i actually found a bunch at a local store of mine for only 25 cents each!  and they have lasted us over a week already!  granted it was just by luck that i found those other swords, but they beat these ones in quality and durability by far. i would not recommend these swords on here to anyone.  they are the least expensive option on amazon, but they are not even worth it.  the fact that they break so easily makes them useless.  don't buy these, look elsewhere!",Negative,Negative,0.9366575

"this definitely offered tons of fun for awhile and the technical info about the climber supporting 100 pounds is correct. but in our experience that 100 pound weight limit works only if your little one is standing still or not moving too energetically.we learned first hand that this climbing toy will tip over if a 35 pound toddler runs up the slide and throws his weight against the back guard rail. since that rail is on the second level, he could have fallen head first onto the floor!  we just happened to be in the right position to leap forward to stop an accident from happening.also, you will not want to take this climber apart - for temporary storage, perhaps- once you have it assembled. moving it from room to room or covering it with a tarp for winter would be preferable. it took us awhile to get it fitted together snugly and the arch over the slide was extremely difficult to snap into place. we had no desire to take it apart to store it, knowing we'd simply have to face the frustration of reassembling it later.",Negative,Positive,0.34968752

"hasbro has a great idea on expanding their lazer tag product line with this product. this is a great first revision as the hardware is durable and feels great. my only gripe is with the app that is lacking in advanced functionality. the good news is if they take the time and spend a little more development time with the app they can take this product to the next level.the current lazer tag app does perform the basic functions you would expect; explosions overlaid on the camera live view, switch of different gun modes, a story mode to play against robots from outer space. what is missing is lazer tag is the stats and more ridged rules to ensure no cheating. lets face it as the little kids that will be playing this will try and cheat any way they can and that will lead to fights, of the fist kind ;)here is how to take this gun to the next level. simply create kids single player type apps such as; duck hunt, skeet shooter, or even better yet a classic carnival shooting gallery type game.

"this product arrived just before my kids (ages three and five, both girls) were to set off for a week at their grandparents, so they took it along with them. let's just say grandma and grandpa weren't sorry to see grover go home, although they said the kids didn't play with him much after the first few days anyway. when i took a look at him to write this review, my older daughter asked me, ""mommy, can you please shut that thing off?""even with several moving parts, grover does appear to be quite sturdy. his head swivels side to side, his arms flap around, his visor raises and lowers over his eys and his cape flaps in the breeze. he does not, of course, actually fly, at least not without human help.but he does talk. a lot. i played around with him for about 15 minutes and didn't get a repeated phrase, so he has quite a repertoire. my parents said they didn't hear any repeats either, except for the obligatory ""hello everybodeeeee!"" when he's first activated. his voice sounds just like you'd expect grover's voice to sound (which is to say, every bit as annoying). unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, depending on your perspective), the demonstration batteries that come with the toy don't last too long.i will readily admit that my kids are not really the target audience for this toy. i think even my three-year-old is too old for it, and it probably appeals to boys more than girls. this could probably be a decent gift for an active toddler through early preschool boy. someone else's little boy, that is. it's a toss up whether this toy is more or less annoying than tickle me elmo, but the target audience is pretty much the same.update: i just noticed that it says ""warning, small parts, not for children under 3"". i don't know how much that's just an obligatory warning on anything not specifically designed for babies, but i didn't see anything obvious that could break off and be hazardous to children. if anything, the hard plastic is more of a threat for bumps and bruises, especially if grover gets swung or thrown around and hits someone. as already noted, i don't think this product will appeal to kids over three, so if you are concerned about this warning for your toddler/two year old, then i don't recommend buying it at all. personally, while there are plenty of reasons why i wouldn't be likely to buy this product, safety is not one of them.",Negative,Negative,0.97329783

"we gave this toy to my 2-year-old granddaughter, even though we felt it might not engage her.  we were wrong.  because it was new and colorful, she was immediately interested.  she liked and recognized the stylized lion, but didn't know how the toy worked, so we demonstrated.she loaded the balls, pulled the tail, and initially liked watching the balls being propelled across the room.  we retrieved them for her, and she repeated the process a few times -- maybe five -- but then went on to other toys.  this is what i expected.  though she didn't say it, she was likely thinking ""is that all there is to this?""all kids outgrow toys.  that's inevitable, but it would be nice to know that when you buy one, the child will enjoy it for a reasonable period of time.  from the experience with my granddaughter, i'd say that the toy is best suited for a one-year old.  at the age of two, kids tend to look for more complex toys.  this one is cute, but doesn't offer enough of a challenge.",Negative,Negative,0.5284404
"i have two good things to say about this toy: 1. it speaks more than just english and spanish, it also speaks in french and mandarin.  i have never seen another toy that speaks in more than english and spanish. 2. my daughter loves the little bit of music the toy makes.yep, not much else good to say.  this toy is pretty lame.  the balls don't pop out like they are supposed to.  they might if you jam down on the tail really hard and have all the balls in the lion, but otherwise, not so much.  the counting resets itself fairly quickly, meaning if you aren't feeding balls to the lion on a quick and continual basis, it starts over at 1.  not so helpful in learning to count.  i guess they have to start back and 1 if it isn't played with for awhile, but the reset to 1 is a very short pause, especially if your kid is crawling around collecting the balls that flew out of the lions stomach.  the noise the lion makes when ""eating"" the ball, a gulping noise, makes it sound like it is part of the words it is saying.  the enunciation of words isn't good, when it says ""francais"" it doesn't sound like it is saying that at all.  it is also way too easy to cycle through the 4 different languages, what a great way to confuse your child.  there should be switches to toggle the languages, not just an easily pushed, and enticing, star button on the front.  the music it plays when you push down the tail is fun music, but it is all of 5 seconds long. having to push down on the tail over and over again to get the balls to pop out gets old quickly and my daughter loses interest.  for a toy that specifically is being marketed as a ball popping toy, this seriously fails, and the counting aspect of the toy isn't any better.",Negative,Negative,0.6064913
