disappointing. Some employees treated many brains. Everything. Room service is required to pay cash, and any request is required to pay cash. The first time I live in a hotel that deals with the style. Is the reason lack of confidence in the guests and cleanliness? The first place in the room is bad.
disappointing. The large area of the apartment. After the apartment from the metro, the presence of insects inside the apartment, not filling water and only one time, the views are very bad, the smells of Indian eating every morning
One of the worst novels I have read or is the worst of them is undisputed, I have very many notes on it, and I intended to write it in a long review, but I feel it is very exhausting after reading it, and I have a feeling that I want to sleep at last after a exhausted trip, and I do not want to sleep. Except when I forget her.
It is truly an epic, Constantine, his father killed the prince because he tried to betray his country and concealed the matter from everyone, and then he bore the burden of betraying his father to protect the honor and glory of his father .. They did not condemn him to death, but to stay alive, he got the spit of the mob and the palm of them, killed him who loved her because she knows that Death on him is easier than trampling on his honor ..... honor ..... the man’s crown and his glory .... if he goes, there is no manhood or men .. from the beautiful lines .... we are now at war with a powerful and mighty enemy We take revenge on him for his injustice, his injustice, his weakness, and his elongation on us with his strength and abundance, so it is worthy of us not to do what we revere from him and take him with, so that God may have mercy on us and look at us with an eye of justice and charity and equals our weakness Of his strength, and we said of his abundance .. I do not know an honor other than the honor of the soul, nor proportions other than the proportions of virtue .. We have not been afflicted with what we have been afflicted with by this witty, witty and shrewd calamity that has befallen us .... except in terms of our pride and our pride and our self-esteem in All our affairs and deeds, and the contempt of our rich for our poor, and strong for our weak, and our master for our black deeds, so the authority of God is upon us that omnipotent enemy who does not depend in all his affairs and positions except on his strength and his support, because we are not used in one day of our lives in all our prayers and relationships except on our strength, our hands, and the penalty The same kind of work, and God did not wrong them, but they themselves were wronged .. People are hypocritical debates They claim to themselves virtuous and privileges what their souls deny of them, they despise the offender and disdain him not because they are innocent as they claim, but rather to delude people that they are not guilty, even if they disclose or speak openly and believe each of its companions by talking about themselves so that you will leave and plead, and when no one of them takes sin Jarrarah .. You know, Father, that the crown that he takes within his reach from the hand of his enemy is not a noble crown .... but it is a crown in any case .. The honorable man who lives from his honor and virtue in happiness congratulates the ideals of kings in their palaces .. Here the man shed this eye The great who did not cry in one day of his life for a sword stroke, or a curse of a spear, or a burst of arrow, and The voice of his wailing and gossip loud as the weak women do in their sadness and bereavement, and it would not have been like to cry or shed a single tear from his tears if the one who wrote to him in the newspaper of the unseen from misery, was standing between the sword and the stabbing .... but it is honor, very severe to Its owner descends with him humiliating descending, or that a hurtful nail of humiliation reaches him, so if he feels something of that he is appalled and his shepherd, and his resolve is weak and his power is weakened, so the crying of the weak cries, and he supports the women.
An experience that I will not repeat again. . There is no internet, there is no cafe
Treat it very well. I did not like anything. In a new night manager, he took a dirham from me and did not give me a receipt for the amount. Arguing that my colleague in my room did not register as a colleague, but he registers as a visitor
Very bad . . There is no family of children with very old furniture
And how does he not love us from his soul breathed in us, and his angels prostrate to us, and his universes mocked us and opened for the sinners of us the treasures of his forgiveness. Any gall .. and his rage does not equal us any rage .. And for our sins we must cry really, and not for any desertion or any separation, or any disease or any death. And that is the case of those who appreciated God the right amount.
It is in principle. Away from the historical mistake in the novel, it is Tariq ibn Ziyad who burned the ships because he was not a guardian. Because he is the unfortunate pasha, he does not review himself every time. I don’t know how, in one of the first authors for the youngest one in the publishing house, I would like to hear that this book is originally described. Despite all the warnings that people wrote here, I only said people recently, and I am unjust to them, Nabil Farouk Kawi. So I said scabby can be in a different need. But the truth is that it is a book that is very much less than any other village it needs before. At first, I used to say that it is the last of which a number of cocktails are worked out for us. But after I concluded it, especially the silly end of it. This story does not deserve to be printed on paper. My only consolation is that I have a PDF and muddish village in it. I don&#39;t know, I used to give myself a way to pay EGP two years when I went to the book fair. I know that the review is not pure literary criticism and it is a personal opinion. But the novel does not even smell literature even. Reducing the novel tells the story of the amulet through the ages. In the end, the whole story tells the story of Atlantis, which is Nabil Farouk, so our brain closed it in every preparation of a cocktail.
Not interested in customer comfort. Breakfast was variable level from day to day. Room service is only available rarely, and reception staff rarely answer the phone
loss . . The hotel is very expensive compared to the type of rooms. The beds are very harsh The hotel treats as an entertainment venue. The services provided are very expensive
The management deals in an inappropriate way and the place is quiet. Breakfast is available. Fourth class cleanliness is excellent. Room cleaner. The administration and its superior style with the inmates. Breakfast was not up to the required level, in addition to taking or reserving a dirham amount until leaving and the extra value is forbidden to take anyone to the rooms.
It was a heavy load on me, I forced myself to the trouble of finishing it so that I would not miss the literary masterpiece that occupied the world and occupied the shelves of the best-selling..I found only a narration with all kinds of disbelief, bad manners with God, and the dignities and miracles of the Dervishes that I reached that blow the soul with a piece of candy that formed In the form of a bird.
When I finished this internal conversation between the narrators of the narrator, who deliberately left the answer to his question / address suspended between two intelligent and two lane gemazets, I learned that Ghassan had reached the spiritual tampering area, and saw life as a trivial deadline between two phases of a fierce war. Laila is the other side of the crime of childbirth, so the rope that takes you open to the abyss, so either you reveal more than anger or you lie blamed on your rocking chair, do not utter a loud voice other than your free buried voice. Saleh / lawyer preferred to remain retired from others, leaving it to chance to cross the path of his life a hurricane and change what she sees as a duty to change without having the final right to overthrow a question mark or replace a point of contact. Saleh, who did not seek his righteousness except when he found himself in front of a very clear mirror, his true / true mask, and it became clear to him that there is no point in talking / interpretation / persistently addressing clarification /. From him and even his murid and his submerged people from the crudeness of judgment, whether it was a destiny that he sent down to the den of the ghoul, so the soul became alienated to accept the role of the deceased? Or is it enough to clap, analyze, laugh and make fun of the punctuation marks that others have placed in front of him / around him / between him / above / below him? Layla . She was killed ... or she passed away, or only her usual role in the story ended, and therefore I opened a wide field of vision so that the upper handle would speak with the threads of the story, and its color would be mixed with a passing shadow and a clear name and frivolous events that reached its pulse on the impact of a predetermined life / end .. Why did it not impress me? the work ?? Why did I give him two stars of origin because he simply touched the absurdity as Ghassan touched it, but I did not hear from her aura because the latter when he wanted to build a philosophy of non-life, inability and fateful mysticism absent from his mind the intelligence / analytical line of the story, jumped from the temple to reach the meaning, and this It was a bitter and unforgivable mistake. To adopt a philosophical / intellectual story, you must first sew the garment in wide sizes so that the reader does not catch you from distress and confuses you in questions that you yourself ignored .. We have a legal issue that was the structure, but to reach the meaning it was necessary To avoid the pitfalls of judicial and defensive construction lawyers so that we receive what he kneaded Ghassan Na and I was the face of this disgraceful Hedda work .. Overall: Dear reader is not looking for a murderer Leila and do not care about, just admitted that all provided by you much either compelling or well-being of the suffering of emptiness.
A star for the fresh language and because he is a political prisoner, but the love in the novel was vulgar and repeated, as if the writer was trying to fill the void in his imagination with crude details that scratched the sophistication of love. ,. Three times it occurred to me that I would choose another book that I would waste my time reading this, but I was biased in order to see the end of this decay as to where it becomes?

The first novel after seeing a story to be completed by you .. By Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq I feel like I lost time. A bad novel with all its meanings. It took me a long time to pass her two months and a half. Not interesting ... and lose realism and credibility in the events ... it is not classified as a literature of terror ... and it does not deserve to be classified among the literature ... without a clear goal. When you start reading, you feel like the writer. Even the cover for fun. I felt that he was not able to collect events and not link them to each other, so he started making new personalities to avoid any need. The writer is information loss and lost sense of it. However, it lacks principles and values. It is not a condition of work in which there are expressions or suggestions, in order for them to be poor. It is also possible that he is missing principles and values and ethics, and his hour of his will will be bad. I completed the novel, and I said to myself now that you will find him familiar with the events ... Now you will fix his mistake ... but it did not happen what I expected. Noisy ... blood ... event spacing ... blood ... indispensable characters ... second blood ... failed champion ... second blood ... end of life was bad. If the writer had finished the book in a famous sentence, our hero would wake up from his sleep and he was terrified, and thank God so much that this was a nightmare that would have swallowed the novel. I did not gain anything, not even pleasure. I hope the writer has a message and a goal that he presents in his writings so that he does not lose his readers even if the goal is fun and interesting. My evaluation has a cover from end to cover / it is appreciated by the author. If you curse her away from the writer, she does not deserve a star. . The novel is presented to me as a gift on my birthday. I do not think when I started reading it, nor did I think it was done when I finished it. But I preferred that I write the reviews of their products after I completely forgot them, so that the words are not sharp or hurt to the writer
Bored, events are expected, and the end is more than enough to see an old movie
The location is excellent and the rest of the services disappointing. The location is very excellent as well as the parking is good and it is at a daily fee of real. The level of service and cleanliness of the furniture is very poor
Very weak. Nothing like the hotel. Cleanliness is very bad
Weak. The entrance and facade of the hotel are good. Bad hygiene and sewage everywhere
The book is about a page about a page ... In the beginning, I was very enjoying the story ... but it was a long time ago .. It has many details that are boring and boring ... In many situations, there was a spurt in the reaction of the characters ... Frankly I read a page but I promised the rest to see the end ... after all the page ragdoll and the end is very normal and expected and provocative for me
Do not stay at this hotel. I did not like anything other than the hotel’s location. The sound of the street in the room does not have any isolation. It is a hotel that is less than normal and forbidden.
I advise not to live in it. The rooms are clean. Its location is very bad and they have no services, and far from the campus there is less taxi riyal
A book about a surfboard. Fit for teenage girls
One of the worst hotels I have stayed in. Air conditioning only and internet. The reception staff treated them very poorly, the Indian reservations manager, who was not credible. I had a problem with the reservation, and I called the bookings.
The debt has many parts that are intellectually weak. I think that a white flumester is better than sadness. The normal dimension. Also, I expected that the office would be better, but unfortunately.
Very ordinary ..... and do not deserve to talk much that is said about it. I didn&#39;t like it
All in all, it carries useful advice. However, he put forward the solutions shallowly. He did not delve into marital problems and how to solve them
Employment ة
Customer rights and services. nothing. The hotel controls the TV channels and their choice only for them. Upon request, refusal to do so. Organized and exposed to accidents Activate the card to enter the room one day from reception, knowing that you have paid the full amount of housing at the rate of days
I think that the last two pages of the novel were not necessary for them. Or maybe I don&#39;t understand. The novel will not be understood unless you finish reading it. I liked the idea. I think some parts of it sensed me with mental retardation while reading it ... the method is twisted in a way that annoys me. First and foremost .. I love Ahmed Al Aydi&#39;s sense of writing
The reason I did not finish this book is because I felt a little bored while reading maybe I could end it someday I don&#39;t know
The book is not excellent as much as it is distinctive, distinctive in its elegant cover, and in its new style .. You feel that you are reading that you are watching short films that suit the years before them. I just completed it in twenty minutes, a nice and generous book in general.
This is my first reading of Rabie Jaber and I am afraid it will be the last. It took me a quarter of two hours to read it, during which I searched with Muhammad about his lost brother, traveling between several cities from Andalusia to the Levant. In my opinion, the novel is poor and weak from its inception to the end. I suffer from a major problem with the writer, who works to repeat more than one sentence or word in his writings
Very weak. . The place is not clean, the bathroom is dirty, and the place is narrow
The novel won more fame than its size, as well as its author, and is banned from the Syrian market, according to what was reported stupidly, without any reason. In his writing, he resorted to this objectionable method. I mean the Muslim author .. The idea of the novel in short: It is a display of a house in the Syrian city of Aleppo, before the outbreak of armed confrontations between the Muslim Brotherhood and the government in a year, during and after it, and it is a good offer that is not without criticism or confusion. Perhaps this is another topic It depicts hate in its own style, and it manifests itself His genius is in very powerful parts of the novel where you feel that you put hate under the microscope, defame hate and even praise it between people and between sects, which led to the most bloody and ugly events of both parties .. One of the wonderful sentences that impressed me when a great Sheikh laughed, from his heart, I feel How beautiful God hates misery and misery.
I read the novel exactly, and I base with my sisters, watching a cartoon movie, I know its end, but I am full to enjoy watching it
Egyptian version of the novel of the fighting club. But I can forgive why his ability to insist on what is estimated
How can a novel so badly be awarded the Booker Prize for Best Arabic Novel of the Year? Frankly disgusting
Some of her poems liked me, some of them didn&#39;t understand him, others didn&#39;t like me.
I did not complete it, I did not find the drama that attracts me to complete it and make me feel excited. Not the beginnings of my acquaintance with the writer, and it will not be the end
Two pages of history, then three pages about the romantic relationships of the sons and daughters of the Jews, then another page of history, then self-made speeches about the importance of associating love with desire and desire .. Eh, which I am his village ?? And the tragedy is that the copy I own bears the seal of the fourth edition
The house of boredom is ruined ... what? The worst novel of precious sentiments, even though I have read almost all of her novels, but this is the weakest thing ever ... Why is that ... What is the amount of preaching and bias for a certain type of human being ... There is no mediator in the characters, ok, very, very evil. It can be useful. It remains a book of religious advice. I don&#39;t care more. A piece of advice for a prayer. I wish that the beard dialogue and the niqab remain a little less than your novels, and that I am the committed person who is the super super who solves all problems. Although I met a lot of people who are committed to the shape, but they are very ordinary, and they are not superheroes, as you imagine them ... and it is necessary in every novel to introduce them in it. One novel, but the one with whom you have a different feeling is Imago, with a little intellectual maturity
The book on human development is simple. Introduction is amazing .. but I don’t know why the rest of the book is for women in particular?
The first and last time I live in this hotel. . The level of services is poor, with insufficient parking spaces, and it is always tight. Request for increased expenses. Please take bills directly after payment and the level of management is low.
A very weak novel and style that requires a lot of development
What is distinctive in the novel is that it includes information about the social and historical status of that region ... As for except for these two sides, I did not feel any surprise, suspense, or integration in the plot of the story ... and some of the events and aspects of the characters are not convincing ... and I liked Catherine ..
A very beautiful novel made me a thousand years around myself, but I got out of it that any relationship between two people should be crowned with respect and containment sacrifice is a novel worth reading
I hope it gets better. So normal. The Wi-Fi was once tarnished and moldy, and there was no cooperation from the employees, and no response
Stone birds. I only liked the introduction and the first poems. Stone children. The second and third poems did not rise to the grace and strength of the first pen and did not directly affect meanings. Dazzled the world. They only have stones. They lit like jellyfish. And they came like good tidings. They resisted. And they exploded. And they were martyred. We stayed polar bears. Her bodies laminated against the heat ...
Very weak. . Breakfast is very bad
Ha? Verse ? Say this again? The longevity of the man does not allow the man to never .. Normal means .. there are no problems .. But the first time I know that his idea is left behind all backwardness and reactionary and primitive and desert mentality de? What is it? Either you are flawed .. Either I live on Pluto. Ok blash ... you are a man of your limited intelligence, and your brain is on its feet ... and you will be delighted with any words ... I have no problem ... I thought people would cut you off in the rural areas ... I found people very happy ... God bless the lessons and sermons ... one was Orthodox Fanatic in Russia .. One said: Come, let us go to the Gulf states, we buy electrical devices ... I mean, do you mean the Gulf countries? Why do I feel that the Gulf countries Japan? . The important thing is that the girl agreed .. They went to the Gulf countries to buy electrical devices .. They went ... they traveled… The girl agreed very easily that Arab Muslim countries traveled and they are Orthodox fanatics in order to buy electrical devices with a knowledgeable one ... Glory be to God. The most important they traveled the most important ... And then here the fangs of the wolf disguised in the uniform of the man-trader appeared, offering them the practice of vice ... all the girls agreed .. all the girls ... except she ... there is no god but God ... she is a fanatic Orthodox ... She works like this ... The important thing is the man tortured and electrocuted. He put out the cigarettes under her stomach ... and heated the iron and put it in her shoulder and faded her passport about her ... to the extent that the other person sat around and met him ... Oh God ... Glory be to God ... I turned on him. And I met him, glory be to God. I took her passport and sat homeless in the street a little .. But because they are the Gulf countries and so .. a lot of homeless .. Yadub is the text of an hour .. I met a man with his mother&#39;s six sisters and his sisters ... I told her story .. and so the game remains cast ... It is suspected first to be a fraud. Oh we are so good But after that, my eyes made it difficult for him and took her home with them ... she is a fanatic Christian ... she does not practice vice, but she lives with ordinary strangers ... she is a fanatic Christian ... of course the first thing they made offered her Islam ... she is a fanatic Christian ... Mardic never entered Islam, and I did not agree to anyone who spoke to her about this topic originally. She is a fanatic Christian. And then the fanatical Christianity with a heart of parchment from two words that they said to her .. and entered Islam. Aren&#39;t you growing up? O Quraysh .. You have converted to fanatic Christianity ... Oh God..I have worn the black veil covering all of her body, so do you not grow up because this is the legal veil that God and the Messenger commanded ... the world is my daughter, full of evil people who are ready to devour your face. After that, I traveled to Russia ... and all of Russia ... all of them ... without exception, they wanted to see their face ... all the airport employees were to pay attention to see their face ... they exalted their work, their interests and their condition, and they waited for them to see their face ... and it is never ever permissible He says it: My daughter is normal. It is never ... impossible ... how? It comes a week, like this, and it cannot be waived ... and then in the other ... with the ability of a capable ... She goes once in the morning ... they call her name and say it, Take your passport, oh ... Glory be to God ... Suddenly, after that ... I doubt that they would add it to the passport, and the bureaucratic and routine complications and legacies ended ... the girl went to her family ... tortured and electrocuted her, and beat her nuts and put him in distant lands. I don&#39;t know how. But this happened ... and they said: You are a fanatic Christian. The girl Mardich bounce. She told them what happened. He said to her: I wish you were engaged in prostitution and did not enter Islam ... Christian fanatics. But it was normal and worldly life and life is sweet ... The important thing is after that ... Praise be to God, thanks to the girl sitting. Her sister spoke about Islam. The girl went to two words and said: God .. it is the right religion. She smuggled her sister after she worked with heavy and concentrated wine for her sisters ... and took from them the keys to the chains she tied to her. O Joe Bilal bin Rabah, and Umayya bin Khalaf da? . What we have ... after this, Dr. Al-Areifi extends many words and that people fight and strive for their religion, and we do not. I don’t know Min Jaya from Norway to help Min in Africa. She stayed victorious ... and one Jewish woman in Germany banged on one and seated through the peephole trying to guide him to Judaism and I don&#39;t know what. Note that the Jews are aware that they are the only ones who have the right to religion because they are God&#39;s chosen people. Myself, I know what obsession? You are the photographer of our Lord, as if it is the Sultan who surrounds his women with the greatest degree of privacy and the veil and does not allow anyone to smell until their smell ... You are why we feel that women are something that comes from Mars ..?. Why do we feel that our Lord has sent another holy book next to the Qur&#39;an urging women to chastity. What is the cheap atmosphere? Why do you always think that there is a war against your religion ... that you are always the best and the rest are a little backward. You live a happy life and others live a messy, flimsy life. People in Russia are all children of a dog and a gypsy .. But the people in the Gulf are correct and the liver is right. Oh hysteria of terror than the other de .. I am a Muslim .. I am better than you .. You are afraid of me .. You hate me .. You declare war on me. My friend, by God, no one is interested in you at all and does not care about you in any way. Why do you feel that Islam is in need of people entering it? Why do you feel inferior, as if you were saying: Islam is ours, you are the birth of a dog. You say to the people: My religion is the correct one, enter in it and God will burn you. Who is the one that people understand, that our Lord is concerned that someone enters into the Islamic religion or not? Why do I feel we are supposed to demonstrate the Islamic religion? We are wandering in order to attract the largest number of les, and entice them to say and invite? Why do you want the religious people to turn into sales representatives ... they would give each other a little bit and say: Enter the debt in our merchants, and give it away. Why are we supposed to stand up and say to them: Religion, this brings a number of features and fascination? The first need: that you would fear heaven if you believed in it ... and not just that, because you can also invite people to it ... no man? I am like astonished. If it was up to me ... you would be the first one and those like you to be charged with contempt of religions. .......... Sheikh Mansah says:. They only know of the rights of women except the right of displaying, removing the headscarf, the right to travel without a mahram, the right to drive a car, the right to work and to mix with men ... and they call these stupid rights. What do you think of women&#39;s rights? You remain the obedient master and she is happy to obey you de ... and she is a queen because she belongs to you ... the queen is the one who is waiting for her obedient master to make her legs collapse in water and salt ... she disappears from the front of all people except he ... is this kingdom for you? Oh God ... you are sure that our Lord created the harem for that? It means one that remains deprived of car exercise, travel with prohibited blood, from work, from choosing to demolish it by itself, and from contact with people. Is this still a queen? What if you were going to do what? Then what do you export ... that your anti-invisibility is that one goes to a dance? Its contents say: they want her to become a dancer, people enjoy seeing her body and her charms ... I mean, she has a woman, you either obedient to the husband, veiled in the house and wearing a black tent ... oh either you work as a dance or prostitute? What a stupid thought? ......................... The songs say Rakia Al-Zina ... Are you sure? So if we forbid adultery, would it mean meaning? I am sure that you are the one who lacks music. Aref you: If I heard only a cut off for Beethoven, not Bach, not even for Omar Khairat, no thunder behind, or for Omar Farouk ... By God, you will remain like the full ... fornication, but who is the pilgrim? You look like you by nightmares nightmares, so keep reading Al-Muathtaan and let the six mother boil you a little Tlio, or guava paper and you remain like the ful. With my great respect to you. And the life of your shredding is that we don’t offer long enough for you like a religious man

A talk about the writer&#39;s childhood formation and a simple and deep discussion of the scientific reasons instead of the other reasons that led him to atheism .... The Egyptians say that a loss in you is the star I gave it hahahahahahaha
disappointing. . This is not a hotel but a twilight furnished because there is no room service for nights and no time to clean the rooms and the internet in the rooms is not working, I mean if they change from a hotel to better furnished apartments
Nice stay. Room cleanliness and helpful staff at reception. The internet is not fast and far from the mosque
Weak. . Disturbing sound daily at night The sound of the suction tank
// . The floors are crushed ceramic, there are cockroaches, there are no hotel services permanently in the rooms, the weakest. There is no Shahi. The services of furnished apartments or less.
First, I refuse to call this work a literary work, as it does not express an idea and did not use a literary language. The work is purely commercial. Secondly, linking what is happening to revive the jinn and demons weakened the novel, but I think that the writer resorted to the card in the Egyptian. My evaluation of Najma was based on suspense and excitement .. Generally this is the first time I read to Ahmed Murad and this novel cut my relationship with him as a writer forever.
Never go to this hotel, my only hobby is traveling and traveling, so I spend all my holidays in foreign countries, and most of these countries are third world countries. I tried it by middle hotels and GH hotels more than once, but I have never experienced any of the hotels that I stayed in with such bad experience that I went through in Nubat Nil Hotel in Aswan. Although his place is good, but the rest of all things are quite the opposite, the staff are unfriendly and rarely willing to help you with anything. Our room was very simple and uncomfortable. The toilet was in need of repair, which is what we had hoped for from the staff there, but no one came to fix it. Finally the breakfast buffet was an insult to tourists / backpackers. In fact it was stupid to stay at that hotel, so we decided to leave the hotel the next morning to come after we had breakfast. And before we carry our bags and leave for another hotel we went for ten minutes to spend some money from the cash machine, and when we returned to the hotel we discovered that the hotel staff had stolen the money from our bags about a euro stolen after we calmed down a little bit we went to the reception to pay the bill and leave, and we asked them where we can find Police station to report the hotel. But they made matters worse when they refused to tell us the location of the police station. But of course we did find the police station, and we filed the complaint. Unfortunately I made a terrible mistake in going to that hotel. From my experience that I mentioned to you, I highly recommend that no one ever go to that hotel
A somewhat mysterious anecdotal group with beautiful and sweet details, but I see that the simulation of the story of Anton Tishkun eventually ruined the first month. I liked the July story, I loved it in every detail. November and December, too
The novel is bad. The idea ... I did not like it, especially when it was presented in an extremely grotesque manner, the language is somewhat weak and the dialogue is cliche, and I did not like the addition of a dirty word in the middle of one of the dialogues. Just as the novel was fast-paced, it made me re-read some parts again, and did not make me live between the two sides of the novel. I liked a lot more disorder than that .. and this is a very good development .. and i am waiting for you next.
When he asks me to face the world with my speeches and reports, I will openly announce my opinion on all this that has happened .. I will tell the world: After three hundred years, I have found everything that has changed except the fear of the word and the annoyance of opinion. A predictive play written by Al-Hakim in general, aimed at setting his perceptions of the world of tomorrow .. What is the shape of the world in the coming years and centuries? ... and how can the world become another picture completely different from the image of the world today, due to the steady progress in science and technology and modern and advanced communication systems and means? ... many questions like these and others, Al-Hakim set her answers through this work .. Although it has not been since the writing of this play and until today more than about sixty years, and this means that there are still about two hundred and forty years until we reach the period when Hakim developed his views From the world .. However, I still see that he has exaggerated the future and predicted it with excessive exaggeration .. Seeing also the shape of other planets, life on them and the imaginary idea, in my opinion, of a person who lives with electrical signals on the surface of other planets far from the Earth and without a blood cycle Or a respiratory system or a beating heart, is an extremely exaggerated and imagined vision I do not think that one day she will find her way to verification on the ground .. Nevertheless, these predictions and assumptions can be viewed as a form of diligence and a kind of reading the future through presentations that are highly changed and altered by development.
disappointing. . The bed is very small and cannot be considered a double
Weak. nothing. There is no cleanliness and the room smells very unpleasant and we do not know where the smell comes from
disappointing. Laundry service. The furniture is old
Once but it was not repeated we had a reservation for two weeks after the travel agency told us so it was fun, and we left after two days. The food was poor, the room is old, no room heating available and the weather was very cold in December. I couldn&#39;t sleep from the club noise. The doors and windows don&#39;t obscure anything. I don’t know how people say this hotel is beautiful and worth more than one star. People may not know what a beautiful hotel we will never recommend this hotel. Once Allen is not repeated. Zurich
Wretched cover and fantasy merging with unbelievable reality that cannot penetrate your mind and attract your attention:. I regretted a novel in which I started disgusting to an unusual degree, especially the parts that I enjoy eating human flesh ... in my opinion, the worst thing I read.
Abdullah Thabet has always been writing to himself without first paying attention to what readers will understand. I can assure you that he enjoys it.
Bad reception. . Bad reception
The writer, may God have mercy on him, wanted to fight the chaff with the chaff .. The fields of which our Lord accepts his diligence remained and repent to all of us:
Why do you not know why in all the writings of Tamer Ibrahim Balaki, people who look like a foreign film, series or novel. The topic is repeated in a way that raises confusion and thought. On the other hand, it is really the idea of chains, which is the person who will see the crimes of the dead and crimes and achieve justice. I worked a lot before, but its handling in this D series is somewhat different. For the number. The name, cover, and savior are very strong for the reading. The idea itself is new, but it needed more innovation and a deeper and more complex plot. The plot is relatively shallow, and in ideas not appropriate for the general story atmosphere. Narration is pretty good. But overall it&#39;s pretty good ...
A bit fun to read before bed .. but the amount of fairy tales in it makes it suitable for children
This means first ... mistakes in words. And once he spoke about Yusuf and Glory be to God, suddenly his name remained Khaled in parentheses, how do you know .... Secondly, what is the whole dialogue, which is healthy, O my ... this is new, but it will not be useful to see the dialogue that is not necessary and is necessary between the companions of Al-Fusha or in the same sentence a word on a word ... how does it mean ... And then the last scene is that he talks about his face to the viewer of each owner, who needs to repeat it because, in general, the story is turned on, but the dialogue is not correct.
They are two books in one book. Chernobyl&#39;s four seasons. Moscow queues. In it, Muhammad Al Makhzangi, in short story style, talks about his observations before and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, which is the island of Pisces, and comes out with a clear idea from the book, which is that what really caused the collapse of the Soviet Union is lying..and lies only. Everything was managed by lying and forgery ... and there was collapse and drowning. In his short stories, Al-Makhznji recounts scenes before the Chernobyl reactor explosion, and the cause of the explosion, which is negligence and lying. He also tells his observations and what he experienced after the explosion and how people behaved and adapted to the issue of the spread of nuclear radiation. To be honest, the writer&#39;s style for me was very normal, it was not interesting for the most part ... some of the stories were good and the writer gave them a beautiful style and some of the presentation was sub-standard in my opinion. The copy that I read was the printing of the General Authority of Culture Palaces in Egypt within a series of literary voices that were poor, and it was taken as being full of spelling and grammatical errors
At first, you feel that you are in front of a wonderful novelist in terms of his personalities, until you end your reading with great disappointment. I liked the topic of the novel, but I did not like the way the style came out. This style can be interesting and attract me when it is small and fast chapters and a closing scene that brings together all the characters of the main novel. Rather, it is the elaboration of the details in most places without putting an end to the novel or even drawing a path that is indicated by an order that loses the novel&#39;s meaning. In the end, the writer is frankly honest in his writing style, but he lacks plot
Random quotes cut from their context. Best read by the author himself
Not at the level of the amount paid for the room. I liked the car parking service, unlike that, nothing. When booking, we had requested a non-smoking room, we were surprised by the smoking room, and we have an allergy to smoke when ordering to change the room.
For clearer pictures. Excerpt from my lens
To start with, the book somewhat reminds me of the Prophet Gibran Khalil Gibran .. However, I did not like this Zoroaster. Unlike the Prophet Gibran .. I am not surprised by the madness of the German heretic philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche ... This man carries a wonderful wonder. He hates the priests and pity them. The woman despises and limits her role to her womb only. He rejects equality and sees it as madness. Calls for enmity between people and fighting each other. He believes in the death of the gods and calls for the superior man who until now does not know where this person will come from if there were no gods. Above all, he comes from a conservative Protestant family, where his father was a priest. Of course, I cannot deny some of the ideas that I liked, but in general ... I did not like him. Also, the poetic narration of the book cannot be denied. Nietzsche was a poet and his words are beautiful. I do not advise the owners of mono-culture to read this book.
Four scenes from an emotional movie. .... the language itself is attractive
Too bad. There is nothing you like never. The room size is written, the room is written, and the room that you book, they give you others. The reception is poorly cleaned.
Bad location. The presence of transport vehicles sometimes. The location of the hotel is bad, it is located in an elevated area, difficult to climb to, the bathroom is very small, and the Wafi is weak.
Movenpick the city is not suitable. Location of the hotel and ease of parking. The restaurant, the way the reception staff deals, the restaurant requests are very late, the hotel cleanliness is not good, room services and cleaning are positively ineffective, in addition to that the amount is very exaggerated
Good. Bad hotel. The service is bad and there is no connection to the campus and there are no parking and no internet service
Nice, but .............................. not our culture of reading
old furniture . Proximity to the Prophet&#39;s Mosque. The furniture is old and has not been renovated since the hotel opened
I like it very simple and straightforward author style. As for the remaining ideas and opinions that are in the book, there is no need in this book. It is the last of which you hear on any coffee my country has no understanding, no benefit, no deep look, no new opinions, or any different vision. Every topic is a little bit too much in the same stories. This changed the strange prejudice against the girls and exaggerated the attitudes and opinions. If the author agreed with some of his views, he would agree with him in a percentage. But, frankly, the good thing in the book is a little sarcastic and comical situations, even if there is exaggeration, but I laughed. Change this watermelon .... If I write, I will write words that are more clear of it
A suitable place for a family going shopping in Dubai. Apartment space suitable for a couple and children near the metro station, parking is available for the car. No oven for cooking, no washing machine, overcrowding and late elevators
Bad in terms of price
If you want to listen to yourself, read ..... Mustafa Mahmoud
. More benefit for children.
Bad . . Brushes
A book is not bad and not good. Memories of the authors, which they believe belong to an entire generation. From the last first-class entertainment book that reads on transportation and no need
A beautiful and stimulating book and a great writer style that makes you finish it with one session. This book is one of the books that has an expiration date and I think its history ends after a year and then the date will kick it to forget about that.
Did you watch the dark comedy by the people of Mecca? No, no, despite the failure of Ahmed Mekki to repeat the success of the birds you are in this movie..However, he is not much less than H Dabur..It is generally a comic..A white comic comedy..and perhaps it does not have much thought and meditation .. But it is not trivial or acidic acidity. The films of Hindy, Mohamed Saad, or Ahmed Eid, the last .. Donia Samir Ghanem is an actress with very great potentials, but she needs someone to blow it up for her..Majid Al-Kadwani is a very strong starter, but he is not eligible for the absolute championships .. At least until two or three years ago, our problem in Action Cinema is the severe human and technical capabilities, because we do not master the work of Alanatsat well. Find us who are good at chasing cars, for example, except Professor Amr McGiver, for example, who are weak, who have weak movies? The trick of the film is weak..the role of a marginal and ineffective Dalal..Anonymous Ninja Character intercalated and inspired by the films of Samir Ghanem and Fouad Al-Muhandis ... The final is beautiful, but it is weaker than the previous songs of Mekki .. The decorations are distinct..and the costumes..The advertisements are new and innovative..The title is already ridiculous..Mohammed Shaheen is somewhat technically matured..Izzat Abu Aouf revolves in the same astronomy. Com .. The montage is not genius .. The makeup is of a medium level .. The story is very old..and the phantom parody treatment .. French paper..No one found it in Egypt except a set of blade paper in their first films. Van Mid Movie was one of the amateur films made on a very small scale .. As they found it in the TV series com .. Ahmed Makki until now is the classy comedian who is good at reaching the classes that are not Others reach it .. it reaches very many levels..because its composition is new and distinctive..but this film was presented below the minimum expected from it..but it is generally..acceptable..and but after degrees of clemency the overall result: from
Very, very boring, although I liked to write it like hey, Daddy .. Unfortunately this book is sub-standard .. Just tweets are not distinguished and I have previously read a lot like it and some success stories that we saved from frequent repetition
The story of Mirta Albania, I read it three times. Tragedy messes with the reader&#39;s feelings
The stories are very short ... describing the human suffering of Alzheimer&#39;s patients .... through a message from Alzheimer&#39;s patient at the beginning of his illness to his beloved wife ..
I don’t know what was written in the year. But in general it is full of retro ideas and in particular. His inferior looks of women .. General, the faces of every man among us are male ego: But what is surprising, how does Mostafa Mahmoud see it in the book:
Very beautiful, brief and light, I loved it
I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to anyone. Wi-Fi only. I did not like many things, starting from the bed, very small, the rooms are narrow, the staff are not helpful, and the car belonging to the hotel did not come since I was staying in it only once and very far from the campus and there is no pure means of transportation, but you walk a long distance
Hogan. A big buzz on the novel The idea is not monster, but the language is weak His star, Ibrahim Abbas Ali idea. The world of the jinn is the closest to us in terror, in its great realism that we are always evangelist. We have curiosity that we know more about the world, but it is not because of the degree of love between his souls and genie. A star of information in the world of the jinn The writer strived to recount the information, but at the same time his writing method was poor. Expecting a better future for the writer. And it was good that I was her village in Ramadan, so Shwei was afraid of the idea that it might remain in the same way as Hujan:
Weak. . Cleanliness of the hotel
I don&#39;t know what to write. Good style, realistic and realistic expression of the immigrants&#39; feelings towards Egypt and corruption in Egypt. And drawing the characters was good. But. The summit of moral decay is found in the novel. There is no morals for children and no respect. A banality that exceeded all limits and destroyed anything that could have remained in the novel. Disgusting and shit. I do not know why contemporary writers do this, why do they destroy their work and bring it down to this level. This translated novels respected from Arab novels. . Allah is my suffice, and the best deputy. Unfortunately, a novel that would have deserved stars had it not been for its porn
Weak. . The TV most of the channels are off, there is no net, the room lighting is bad, I sat down when they cleaned my room
Weak. . There is no parking and the one is looking down on finding the position, and they also asked me to leave at noon and the high tax rate was not a hotel but more like residential apartments
disappointing. Views. Services
I will not repeat the visit to this place. I made a reservation during booking on the basis of the cost of the stay, except that the hotel deducted an amount of thousands of dirhams from the credit card. I don’t know why .. there is no credibility. Bad room service and lack of cleanliness where there are flying insects in the room. Food service is bad in terms of taste and method of presentation. Smell of cooking in rooms after midnight. Bad and paid Wi-Fi service. Other hotels provide free Wi-Fi to guests. I stay there again because it is simply too bad a miserable and crowded location all day long because of the roadworks there
Weak. . Take real parking fee per day, service is poor
Very weak. . The place is not clean and has all kinds of insects and the gas stove is supposed to be electricity and the price is not worth the place and it cannot be visited again.
Bad novel is not distinguished by anything but extreme boredom in the personal opinion of Youssef Zidan, the author of the one novel so far, Azazel.
Half of it is very beautiful, and the other one that includes our old stories with new sewing is very cold.
Bad . Very bad. Cleanliness, location, food is bad, nothing is ever good
Weak. The hotel is in an old and dilapidated building and does not rise to the name Tulip Inn. Dirty and small and the furniture is old
Unexpected disappointment and shock. The location of the hotel on the Palm Island and sea views. The employees were very bad at treating them as if they were working in a Nojoum hotel in addition to the lack of atmosphere. Clean it as required, and the diversity of eating at lunch, for example, was simple. I expected that I would spend happy days, but unfortunately, I was very disappointed.
Not a good trip. . Bad food, bad coffee, bad furniture
I kept struggling for a whole week reading it as usual to read novels ... I do not deny that prison literature loves me very much, but this novel fell into the trap, it did not mature to be a love story .. and it did not settle to be a tragedy in prison it is a story between Ben could not tip the scales On the other and do not know how to win the poker? . I do not deny that the similes and the pictures are beautiful, but this does not intercede for them by obtaining a boring prize that is somewhat depressing. Rtm protects the novel slightly after and forces you to complete it. There are disgusting details, I do not know why it was included in the novel that made me skip some pages. In general the novel is not good and I would not recommend it at all. The star of the beautiful language only
My last summer stay was better, please review the staff and sugar. . The cleanliness of the female employees at the reception is on / and /
Unfortunate start .. I am very impressed by the writer and I am lame to the lame and I was very eager to read the story of the female mirage, which I heard a lot. I felt miserable when I penetrated the pages of this book. The more I read, the more I waited for the story to become more exciting and more interesting, but it was getting boring. And you feel a kind of contradiction. So all the words are beautiful .. and all the words have the accent and the love of the letter. But half of the talk was unnecessary. I felt that he was going around in circles ... that the messages were too long and it would have been desirable if they had been shortened and, as I read in a previous comment, this book was enough for a page
The worst hotel I&#39;ve stayed in. Close to Mahbas Al Jin buses. The car park is very bad and very very narrow, and because of the parking, disbelief was cut on it. Bad for Hasna alone, only his proximity to the campus ... and this is the last time he was booked
Oh bad shabby room, the service was very attentive but inefficient, the facilities were poor except for the pool, i.e. there are no satellite or cable TV, the wi-fi was not connected, and the restaurant probably caused severe diarrhea and vomiting.
I liked the cover a lot, but I did not like the Diwan anyway, I liked a number of poems not much, I don&#39;t know, it may be that the repetition of ideas and words is what made me mobilize from the book, I don&#39;t fault the writer&#39;s style at all, the problem may be from me, I do not prefer reading the blind In any case, however, I used to read his poems each one separately via Twitter and I admired many of his words and poems, I wish you success and put all the contradictions in mind and waiting for a new office, taking into account the previous mistakes: ..
Truthful hotel, pictures are false, reality. This star-rated hotel is the most I appreciate. There are no proper services, bad room services, toilets collect water, wash and floor
I booked and did not get an apartment. . I booked a two-room apartment, and when I arrived, he said that there was an empty apartment.
Our Lord accepts a supplication. Location / breakfast buffet. Room service is slow / rooms are not clean / requested a double bed before the stay I was surprised by two single beds and upon my request for a double bed they attached the two beds together and found a bed larger than the second ه هه ه
Weak. . The room is very very small and the pictures are not real .. there is no Wi-Fi .. very far from the sanctuary as most of the road has risen .. the presence of smokers is always a disgusting thing .. the receptionist is blowing smoke in the faces of the residents.
I am the first time to enter Al-Ajami restaurant. Their branch was in Jeddah, because my brother praised him, based on his knowledge of the Riyadh branch. We asked for a dish today, and we had edam and asked for grills and appetizers. I ask him tomorrow, but not once, I liked eating Madri, why is my brother Tayer in it, who wants grills and appetizers, will the fruit of Lebanon go to Al-Wazzan restaurants?
Very much, very much, the book, although the topic is important, but it could be presented by a lot better than that, I felt that the writer had a camel or I want to say them and built the whole book on them, so every bit you meet will say the same idea, but again, terribly repetitive Even though he himself used to sell repetition and criticized him in the book as a means of influencing groups that he would consider reckless and emotional and do not use the mind, to the extent that I doubted that the book itself is a social experience to prove its content, because if you were convinced of the content of the book you yourself remained part of a group The vocabulary that he explained applies to them, as well You see that the topic contains any creative ideas, all of which we all know, but the idea is that he demonstrates it with historical incidents that confirm our beliefs to us and know that it is not in our imagination, but this book is one of the needs that I feel has fluctuated like this or that it is based on a good idea but I do not exert effort in it Adequate, the idea is sweet, but implementation is a monster.
Satisfactory romance .... I could not know what the writer wanted to say ... a man who plays with money as much as women do ... did you like it or loved his money ??? How did you accept to pay the expenses of an expensive hotel and luxury meals ... then refuse Cash money ??? A .... some few phrases I liked, such as:. She does not know who is sharing her joy. This is the highest degree of unity. The poor is rich with his amazement, but the rich are poor because he is too accustomed to what makes them surprising.
Attention should be paid to cleaning brushes, Kuwait and bathrooms, and removing the smell. Location. There are no positions
There is no worse way
Fauchel Hotel. . Disturbed sleeping comfort, no electric heater, swimming pool closed, Wi-Fi only for one device, fridge free, poor hot water when showering, hotel management is not smooth with guests
In fact. Rest sighed upon completion of reading. I don’t deny that some of the stories are okay. But there is so much boredom tired of me. Next to Allah and Zaabalawi: I like it very much
Well ... this is a philosophical novel par excellence, heavy on par excellence ... In an object that cannot be lightened, Kundera played the role of writer, philosopher, and knowledgeable narrator who penetrates all atmospheres, and tells you what has not happened yet, then he continues the narration on the natural line, in a writer movement It is worthy to develop to use it better. This does not mean that it was misused and it is the best of the novel by the way .. As I said, the novel is heavy, and in many passages I felt that the language I translated was also heavy .. I cannot blame the translator because I read a lot of what I translated Marie Touq, perhaps the idea&#39;s strangeness and complexity reflected in the words, so it came as a heavyweight in its turn, despite ... That the writer succeeded in communicating his philosophy, but the suspense betrayed him, and he did not leave me bored in many moments of reading.
It has many sweet needs. But it was a disadvantage that the style of the subject matter of the expression was included in the text so as to take the text of a page. And it has trivial needs cool down. But, in general, it is a good book that some people may like
I hope to improve because it is attractive. . The level of luxury of rooms is commensurate with the name of the Shangri-La Hotel, which is known for its luxury of rooms and the quality of its services. Even the razor blade does not exceed one dirham, unlike the services obtained by the Shangri-La Hotel Istanbul and Shangri-La Muscat. The hotels I have stayed in.
I stood up when I was waiting for me, I did not need to give up, but I did not complete it, but it was not very boring
Two stars. Why?. One of those beautiful poems I wrote in the seventies. And one for the language I used in those poems I wrote in the 1970s. Other than that, I exaggerated the costlyness until the language became artificial ... and exaggerated the severity of love and jealousy ... In my opinion, the simplest words are those that increase poetic poetry. I don’t know if I wrote almost all of these lines in a hurry, but I was disappointed in dreams
I hope that his level will improve like before. The crew is very bad. Room cleanliness is bad
disappointing. . There is a much better smell of the room in the room, the Emirates Grand Hotel is incomparable with it
Stayed unsatisfactory. nothing. Weak services do not deserve one in ten
The worst thing I read for Dr. Hamad Khaled Tawfiq is a very boring narration. I used to bear to myself that I had finished it because I didn&#39;t like to book a book without what I had saved.
Services are very poor in the hotel. I liked the politeness and gracious reception from the reception staff, the teacher, the teacher, the joys of the summit in the professional and the literature, and the respect of the guest .. The hotel needs maintenance in the floor of the room and in the bathroom. Stars
Regardless of not accepting the idea of scrapbooks in this form. And there is no literature, this chatter and delirium. However, I have witnessed the same thoughts that I feel more anxious than to be a statice on a social networking site. Had it not been for the part called Badeea and the idea, the book would not have been valuable at all. ... Note: I just liked the paschal after using colloquial degrees in her first book, I liked it
As a son. I don&#39;t like pure
Bad and only good if necessary. The location is relatively. everything
I just say. This novel is among the novels in which I frankly shocked: /. The name and revo that I read is what attracted me as I read it. The method is really very sweet .. I did not feel pure boredom and I read it. And the large number of stories are distinct, sweet, and cool. But . In fact, despite its great length, I did not benefit from it with any idea or even information. Just fun stories, I don&#39;t want more. What annoys, it remains that after this length, there is no end. Where is the end? Where is the end? Almost nothing, no fate is set for any character and all ends are open. Even the relationships of the characters with each other are still not clear at all. And most of the thing was myself in it .. It keeps more sophisticated than this:. Unfortunately, this is one of the novels that I would not advise anyone to read. Because he will be wasting his time and feelings on Al-Fadi: |
There is no summary of the book better than what Dr. Mustafa mentioned about the book itself, and it is the proper reading of the Sufi heritage. It is the critical and selective reading that weighs each letter of the balance of Sharia and displays it in the light of the Sunnah, the book and the sound belief that our book taught us and that we have peace be upon us. And if he called us to this transgression in front of Sufism in our time ..... may God rest his soul, Dr. Mustafa Mahmoud
Good message
It is simply the six that you liked explaining to us the reasons for the hero&#39;s stinkiness and the heroine raining in the first part. Not a single one. It proved to us the stubbornness of the hero, and the heroine fell ...
It is assumed that the book refuses and rejects the wrong behavior of some Muslims, which was a reason that led to their backwardness. And their return after what they would not have come out of them scholars and philosophers. And if it came to him, we met the writer in the middle of his reversal of the mistakes of Muslims. Islam revokes itself. Some excerpts
Like his residence. Its proximity to the campus only. Everything I did not like, not the cleanliness, the staff, the service, and the smell of the hotel
Fun to move between places I love very much. Relatively poor in the rest of its ingredients as a book.
A book was asked, a loss in the fairy of its place, and the time spent on it, and the writer is weak, friendly and clear in using synonyms and meanings that are not controlled, in addition to the repeated pages and typos in the original edition, while the writer is the owner of the publishing house
Please replace the crew from the manager to the cleaner. I didn&#39;t like it. The reception staff are bad to deal, no one carries bags, and the room smells bad, there was only one soap and no toothbrush
A relatively interesting novel in the first, but in general, it is tired and the writer&#39;s style is very, very weak. The only good thing is cutting in style and dividing the story and characters into parts that are interesting. In general, the method is weak in spelling, grammar, and general in a provocative manner
Not like his reputation. When you pass by the restaurant on the road to Al-Oruba, the decor is tight. It stops thinking that you will eat the best Japanese food in Riyadh. The interior design of the restaurant dazzles you. However, you clash with a waiter who is neither Japanese nor even East Asian. He speaks to you with a strange and difficult accent on the ear. And then you order your seemingly delicious food on the menu. As for the application, the quantity is small compared to the pictures shown. As for food, it is never delicious. And blame yourself after the end of your meal for coming to this place. Also, its prices are very high compared to the quantity and quality of food. I would never recommend going to this restaurant.
If we were talking about storytelling, it is stories, no doubt, and it is something that has become rare .. As for the pleasure of storytelling from ideas, projections and style, I did not feel pleasure even with mentioning Christ and the prophets, with or without reason. Even with some projections like the one who sought refuge from Satan in order not to see the truth. The two stories in which I felt a new idea are a sweet and oud girl; the yearning for a butterfly. And if the writer left them in the middle without real completion.
A weak story in every need
Providing the park and saving two workers to download the bags. Swimming pool. Everything is frank
Rakikah&#39;s narration is not at the desired level. The narration is very fast, moving from one event to another from the past to the present ... mentioning several personalities without sufficiently touching on their human depth.
The beginning of the novel is lengthy, exaggerated, and exhausting, in addition to the sudden move from one place to another, which I find disturbing. The choice of Arabic and especially Egyptian names was strange, unpalatable names. The atmosphere was new to the Jewish world, new information was added to my mind ... I did not like the end and felt that it was looking to break the barrier of hatred and not accept the other. As if we could easily
The novel undoubtedly deserves to be on the throne of the most ridiculous and the most boring novels ever. A mixture of superficiality, failed philosophical attempts and vulgar market language. The idea of using the Latin number or hepta to express love is not a precedent for the writer, as many writers used it before him such as the French writer André Morois in his book The Seven Faces of Love, and Professor Abdel Wahab Mutawa in his book The Seven Masks of Love, this is a famous literary expression inspired by the seven masks That the Jewish princess Salome wore in front of King Herod while she performed her famous dance, which was rewarded with the head of John the Baptist or the Prophet of God, as the antiquities narrate.
This item is considered good but not practical when making any phone calls
.. I was astonished after completing the book with a very simple story. I was searching between his two heads for a deeper novel. Especially since I used to visit the offices to acquire it and every time the edition was implemented, and if this indicates something, it indicates the writer&#39;s fame and its lines ... I hope for a better future.
Weak. . Wi-Fi The room is adapted, adapted, the toilet facilities are too few and not enough, there is no free breakfast, the amount in front of all this is heterogeneous, unfortunately
Very weak. Bad hotel in all respects, not booked by clients. The whole hotel didn&#39;t like it
Filled with excessive stuffing and boring for a novel, but its historical landmarks are very rich, especially for this era of time.
I thank the writer&#39;s effort to compile the news, but I do not think it is any more than the sealed nectar.
. price. The staff, log-in service, and expensive food and beverage prices
It smells wild. Wi-Fi. It smells wild
At first, I would like to say that it is not a story but a story. The style of the writer is very simple, his literature, and his communications are very few and may reach weakness sometimes. Unfortunately, the story is expected and repeated very much. I expected from the events after the first two chapters of the novel. The writer succeeded in describing that not everyone who received an education, regardless of his degree, can overcome his nature and his first ignorance with ease. The writer played on the string of maternity, is it maternity blood or education and starch? Parenting is a different matter, although its strength is no less than maternity. I didn&#39;t like much and didn&#39;t hate it. I think I need another experience with Nuran Salameh until I make a firm decision about it.
The worst management I&#39;ve seen in my life, especially from the Egyptian crew working at night. Furniture and price. The staff at the reception Egyptians and some Saudis do not understand the meaning of hotel management and very bad manners
Difficulty moving to and from the campus. The hotel building is good, the room is spacious, and it has a TV screen with various channels, especially the Qur&#39;an and Madinah channels. The level of breakfast in Ramadan is good and varied. The worst thing is that it is assumed that the hotel has transportation to and from the campus around the clock and if we are surprised that there is one bus and we have to wait for it to return and on the return flight we waited more than an hour to arrive and did not arrive until after calling the hotel and this was after the Eid prayer. That it is not connected to the campus, but to the Jamarat station, and we must ride the buses of mass transportation from the position to the sanctuary, and vice versa in return. The level of cleanliness and room service is very poor. The cleaning agent is not available to clean the room and there is no sign requesting room cleaning. At the reception there is an employee who has no responses or information about anything
I liked the book, dealing with university life from such, on the one hand, I liked the part of time management, part of the difference between high school and university, as well as the types of receiving the visual, auditory, and motor learner. The same is essential for a successful career:. First, always think about developing yourself and your performance. The feeling of satisfaction and sufficiency in what we are is a declaration of death and we are alive with each morning. Ask yourself what I must do to become better and in the evening what have you learned today? Secondly, read in self development books and improve personal and social skills. Third, you must work to develop your English without getting tired. Fourth, improve your speaking and speaking skills. Fifthly, while you are at the university, you will be exposed to experiences outside your field of specialization. If you attend a lecture or take a course outside of your specialization, it will add you a wide horizon. Sixth, I make a special effort to become familiar with the basics of dealing with computers and develop your speed in entering data using writing programs such as Word.
Sand Beach Hotel Don&#39;t waste your money I don&#39;t often complain or write reviews but due to my week in this hotel I wanted to warn others not to waste their money. It is full of deafening disco music until four in the morning every night. If you are unfortunate enough to have a room near the reception, which is abundant then the loud music will wake you up, passing sugar-passing guests, door knocking sounds, etc. .. The hotel is basic and the rooms overlooking the pool are filthy, I found even bugs in the room and on the bed I asked for my transfer and got Their room was a little better in the main building. In general, I will not return to this hotel and recommend others to book elsewhere.
disappointing. nothing. Disturbed bedtime from adjacent rooms
Very weak. . Singles with Mix families
status. Think from now on to eat live ... all people are Quraysh. So spoke pleasure
Manazel Al-Aswaf Hotel. The location of the hotel is close to the sanctuary. Many of I dislike it at the aforementioned hotel. The hotel drastically dirtied the photos of the rooms are better than reality when I looked at it with my own eyes. There is a lot of inconvenience in the hotel, so it causes the guest to feel uncomfortable and private. I booked from the site rooms with the highest hygiene and elegance in the photos and surprisingly, the existing rooms are not suitable for people staying in it. Upon leaving the hotel, the receptionist asked for an additional amount, although we paid the agreed amount before staying at the hotel. I hope every person who visits the aforementioned hotel makes sure of the rooms that were booked, are they actually the same before paying the amount and if the hotel suits him then he takes the payment receipt because when the room is delivered at the time of the exit he is asked for an additional amount on the basis that he did not pay the full amount. That&#39;s all I noticed The aforementioned hotel, God is the guardian of success.
I don&#39;t have a bad description of the hotel. Free breakfast only, God bless the blessings. Everything I did not like about the hotel, the most important of which was the staff&#39;s appreciation for the performance of their work, the lack of rooms, and the lack of room services responding to the requests of guests in general.
I did not enjoy staying at Sama Al Diyafa. The bed is comfortable, but the bedspread is nice, and the bathroom is dear to you. Everything I did not like, no smell, cleanliness, and no service
disappointing. . Experience entry and exit services
Long boring and nothing new and needs to be renewed.
It is possible for the hair to be worn away. Could: |
I couldn&#39;t find it more than a teenager’s words for his love of simple style and language popular with lovers and does not bear the flavor of a writer&#39;s style
Events narrated by Gandhi in a somewhat narrative style about a page. He talked about his life, his family, his parents and his early marriage. He talked about his experience with eating meat. And about the theft he made to smoke cigarettes. And about the idea of suicide that I submit to. His trip to England to study, and his sect to oppose this matter. He worked as a lawyer in South Africa and was subjected to racial harassment. At the beginning of the book, I felt an enjoyment until I finished about a page quickly. But in the middle of the book, I began to feel lethargy and boredom ... especially after his departure and his family to Africa .. and not allowing his children to enroll in schools and only to teach them at home without a full-time for them .. As well as his call to the children and young Indians in South Africa the need to leave the study that makes them slaves and restricts their freedom .. As if he was not convinced of the importance of education except in the final chapters of the book upon his return to India. Gandhi did not know much about Islam, and his readings were limited to Christianity and Hinduism. Perhaps this was due to the lack of devotion to Muslim preachers in India and South Africa or to the scarcity of foreign books on the Islamic faith at the time .. It was mentioned that he had known many Indian Muslims .. He did not mention whether one of them influenced his thinking or not. Although Gandhi was not a Muslim. However, most of what he did and mentioned in the beginning of the book was the first for Muslims to do. Our religion urges us to do and abide by those good qualities. In one of the Indian films, the phrase: If Gandhi had been born in Hitler&#39;s time, he would have been a Nazi. Question: If Gandhi had been born in our time ... how would he be?
For me, it is boring and I did not finish reading the topics. It was consumed and did not bring anything new
disappointing. Room space, bed comfort and mattress cleanliness. There is no service available but Wi-Fi
Very confused between two stars and one star. Unfortunately, the novel is never romantic, it means like you never imagined The amount of boredom is abnormal. I am financial, I am in history, hawk hunting, and the words of Shaheen’s uncle are all astonishing. I mean, this is necessary. End of the novel is very bad cold. I chose two stars, one of them for the name and cover, and the other for some good sentences, for example. We laugh because we rejoice .. laugh because good things happen .. laugh so that we forget .. and laugh so that we do not die as much and sometimes laugh so that we do not forget laugh. Unfortunately, the novel was never sweet
Normal .. it is not possible to do more than this
Normal . An ordinary hotel that does not deserve value and distance from the Sanctuary
Very bad . I did not like anything. Bad location, work staff and very bad service. Overpriced price, as the price of two days&#39; accommodation at the site was real and I was surprised when I arrived that the price was AED. In general, it is a bad hotel in all respects.
Yana, oh ... or in English? The idea of the movie is the same as the idea of the American movie that starred Jim Kerry, which is that a person lives in him two completely different characters, in the Egyptian case in which Jim Kerry was replaced by the struggle of Al-Shafi’i and Rene Zolliger Prem Baroudi, there was a very naive happy to the point of provocation and controlled by a character Another sinister appears from time to time is Hazem, while Lotfi Labib is treating him, and while Hazem is involved in several criminal acts, Saeed remains and his greatest ambition is to win a beautiful love that is played by Reem Al-Baroudi, and during the events Hazem implicates half of the other character Saeed in several things and comes out From inside to take over a piss Suddenly he wandered without Saeed&#39;s control, while the film appears weak dramatically, but it showed representative capabilities for the struggle of Al-Shafi’i, who is known for his talent, so the struggle of those he actually sees sees a person far from all the characters he presented, and far in the sense that he did not present a personality to her even if one hint His true personality or the way he spoke, so whoever knew him with a master in Tamer and Shawqiyyah only and met him with his real personality, he would find a big surprise. Nidal showed his representational ability in several scenes in the film, the most important of which is the scene of the fight between Hazem and Saeed, and they are the same person when Hazem and his other personality, Said, beat one of them Hammamet, the reactions of the struggle was very strong And convincing to the viewer that there are two people in a fight inside one body, and the other fight that happened between them inside a nightclub at the end of the movie and the scene in which Saeed resisted a firm exit and succeeded in that, far from that, the good movie is not only a good actor, without a good story and scenario and a directing vision An insightful art, production, and make-up artist on the occasion of a happy personal haircut, there is no film, without the integration of all the elements necessary for a good movie that keeps the good actor as a million pounds. Dramatic Directors and Other Producers Only No Guy Or is it the lure of absolute championship? We do not know.
In principle, the book is completed in the hands of two hours .. one who said months of depression said Hoba, write to me about two verses of vernacular poetry and youth. The one who took the two stars liked it as one cam .. The book informs us that if any of you write about Elvis with the benefit of printing in the books .. But the defect is not in the writer The defect remained in the publishing houses that I want to do with money and p. Colloquial poetry has people, and I wish we would respect this .. I try to understand what he meant by what Diwan wrote in Egyptian colloquial. Muhammad Ibrahim, you are not a colloquial poet.
Articles about love. The article of Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq did not attract me. I benefited from the part of Muhammad Sami, but I knew nothing about these spies. What attracted me the most part was Nabil Farouk. I laughed at Tamer Ahmed’s part. Although Tamer Ibrahim&#39;s part is not new, I am attracted to his writings involuntarily:
Weak. nothing. The hotel is very dirty
Whoever forgives a lot suffers more. . She loves to dance a lot, but unfortunately she dances more than her wounds. . Today, the second and the minute have passed, I miss her right to the sky. I personally called this book :: I wish it had not been read. . Very painful
There is a thin thread between boldness and insolence in literature .. It is a thread that the author unfortunately did not realize
I tried to complete my abnormal absurdity, my mind could not bear.
Acceptable . The hotel is modest, and a bit good. Cleanliness is poor, furniture is old and outdated
A nice book, light and cute ... Suddenly, I discovered that Chloe loved only me
It is forbidden to live in it. nothing. everything
Bad .. loss in which the style of poetry and good poetic analogies .... do not say discusses an issue..any issue discusses..with all those obscene details and bold descriptions..why ?? When all this .. If the issue is incompatible with religion, then morals, then the values of society..beware, be careful, and be disciplined..this is not freedom. ..And not freedom of expression .. you support a sick and unacceptable behavior..and give them the means of treatment and salvation by writing your writing as well instead of all this ... sorry.
I think that Sherine Hinai will have to reconsider this novel a lot again. When I fell in my hands and Sherine&#39;s reputation, I had a good necrophilia, expected by a more mature and bold novel, with a relatively large number of pages that exceeds necrophilia. The result was just the opposite. Truthfully I never enjoyed it ... satiated by the theories of the global conspiracy in which Dan Brown put the last word and anyone who tries to write in it again will never add new and it has been. The author herself indicated among the events that she resembles the events of Dan Brown&#39;s novels by the heroine. The rhythm is very slow, and the events do not move until late after the boredom has possessed me, so I push myself to complete it without stealing my eyes and pushing me to devour the event as its previous version. Sherine advised me. The first: You have a really good narrative talent so I hope you will be very patient before any work and there is no need to rush and come up with an idea that does not offer, does not delay, does not help you, and does not benefit me as a reader. Take your time until you return to a topic and plot that only you can do ... just like everyone shocked you in the first novel. Second: I hope to provoke your literary abilities in something new, away from psychological horror. Do not limit yourself to only one branch. Sorry if I had disappointed you ...
I call it essay collections, just like anecdotal collections, where a collection of the articles of an author is collected in a book called one of these articles, and it is presented to the reader, whether it is combined by one idea or one topic or not, such as Idris Poverty for Idris, and this book. The funny thing is that this type of book is a transport book with distinction in the sense that it can be read in transportation, as it is a more useful alternative to newspapers: it also does not add anything new to you than knowing the author&#39;s point of view on this or that issue, meaning that you read to the author and not the topic in other words. An hour with Youssef Idris, an hour with Mustafa Mahmoud. And it ended:
In the visualization of the underworld of the adult world, with a cinematic plot ... Ahmad Murad&#39;s writings are useful for cinematography
I would like to read to Khalil Gibran if I cannot sleep
Nice and her blood is light, but unfortunately, it is not worth exaggerating this whole. But that does not deny that it is advancing the reality of post-revolution in a nice irony. The whole concept is centered on its protector, the thief, but it is very beautiful
How much I hate novels that get wide fame for and there is no need for a novel where you can jump a page and do not feel any defect of any kind. Oh repeating hard
Very weak. None. There are parking spaces for the hotel that guests are not allowed to stand in. The Egyptians deal in the reception is not good Allocating the worst tower in the hotel to the guests of Boking, the tower is the number of cleaners who do their work only with Bakhshish and they do not receive salaries
Prediction from the first Hollywood, Bollywood, Egyptian cinema, Naama Bay and there may be more for the same story and at the same pace ... the place and the heroes of the work may differ but the main theme is the same, and director Las Hallstrom completes with his movie parked at the same station to present a woman called Katie Julian Hoge which She arrives in a small town after escaping from her husband and his harsh treatment of her, in an attempt to start again and remains hidden while her husband tries to search for her and return her to the fist of his hand ... and thus there is nothing new in the movie; director Halstrom abuses the story of the author Nicholas Sparks and submit it. And if we look at the romantic part of the film, especially the love story that brought Katie and Alex not going beyond the events of the movie, which was natural and supposed to be the movie is classified under romantic drama and it is the basic line on which events are based, and to complete the surprising moments, you will see the dramatic plots of the film that are totally irrational; starting from Katie&#39;s ability to escape, in addition to her constant contact with her neighbor who helped her without that at any time telling her what happened to her husband after his stabbing the knife, also involving the psychological problem of Ibn Alex in the story and his suffering from his mother&#39;s death and not exploiting it in Katy&#39;s approximation to him and thus her proximity to The Alex family, and the author did not refer from a relative or a distant son to his father Alex, so did he cause the death of his mother, for example? Or was he treated badly? ... and in addition to all this, you are one of the first scenes that you will know the sequence of events and predict the end, what will it look like? It can be the nature of the place in which the film was portrayed was one of the goodnesses that are mentioned, and let the evaluation of the film count. If you are looking for a romantic movie to watch it at the end of the week, I advise you that you are away from the film, as it will not achieve the text that you expect.
Very weak. Albek his side. You are not allowed to enter before 2 pm, and the Egyptian wants to bribe you to enter before
disappointing. Room size. There is a problem in reaching the campus if you have children and adults in Senna. There is no direct road to the campus
Confused in his evaluation. For me, if I hadn&#39;t been to my studies in economics. I would have enjoyed and loved it as an entrance to the economy. But for me, the book did not add anything new that was as influential as a drop in a glass of water. Setting a quick overview of the economy through an explanation of economic development. From the commercials, through the naturalists or the fiefs, to the capitalists. Explanation of supply and demand is the sum of the total output of the difference between the macro and micro economies. I recommend reading it to anyone who wants an introduction to the economy. :
Weak. The receptionist treated the classy place nearby for shopping. The poor hygiene is one elevator which makes the waiting long and sometimes not working.
Very tired, very expensive, without luxury. Old and bad shower, towels smelled bad. car parking. The bed is without mattresses
Why do I need to buy the book when I accidentally saw it in the library, Dr. Ghazi Al-Qusaibi commented on the novel as it is the best evidence that leads to the depths of the phenomenon of terrorism. I expected to throw a new idea other than the old, repetitive, boring, and unfair idea ... I wished that Abdullah Thabet would be fair, generalization and exaggeration is the whole story. Zahi, who moved from extremism to extremism that Abdullah saw, has moved from hyperbole to moderation. It is clear and clear that Zahi is originally Abdullah Thabet since I started reading, and I feel that I read Abdullah Thabet’s biography, which he wrote by himself .. Each writer has a point of view and the book will certainly be the writer&#39;s attempt to make us see that his point of view is more correct. I believe that Abdullah Thabet did not convince the other party of his idea of whoever supported his words, so he will see that the book is evidence of the correctness of his saying and he is distracted by it. I never liked the plot in the novel and felt a bit underestimated in some situations. Why was he trying to distort the religious current with all this force? I admit that I resisted so hard to finish the book to reach an area between me and him, perhaps in the chapter of his talk about love we met even a little.
Rate it. Some of the pages I was reading while I was enjoying and some of them were really boring, but the thing that I did not like about the colloquial dialect of the eloquence made his writing somewhat stubborn.
The book needs to change its name to the gift to Islam after I was drawn to the title and after reading the first pages I found me reading a book about Islam not to mention similar events with other narratives such as amnesia and like the hero opening the book of God randomly to any until her heart reassured the events likened the narration of the word of God. A bit exaggerated. The two stars for the title and cover only:
I did not like much about the writer&#39;s deepening of one meaning: love .. it was not balanced in meaning .. so it did not suit me very much. I finished it in four days. And I did not come out except in conclusion words without refuge. I felt for a while that this voucher never belonged to the book:. quotation:. The ugliest hearts that lent us. Then back to the owners,. And the most terrible moments that we live. With others and feel alone. . When someone tries to throw your chest with speech shells. To shake the branch of your anger, do not pay any attention to it. Trees do not suffer the bitterness of autumn. Thoughts send a message to the writer, and like him there are many, they think a thousand times before they publish a book:
In short, Aziz ... is someone who is fluent in involvement and professes an incomprehensible flight like many of us, and Joman saw that it was not good.
disappointing. . The hotel is in an elevated location, with tables indicated in the bokings.
I read the book several years ago at a time when I was fond of reading about Gog and Magog and the battle of Armageddon and the signs of the Day of Resurrection, but now I think I have finished that stage after I came to a conviction that many books that talk about these issues do not depend on acceptable sources but are convictions and presuppositions The writer has it and then begins to demonstrate it either with prophetic sayings, most of which are weak and the correct ones are difficult to conform to the idea promoted by the writer or evidenced by historical narratives that are closer to myths than to reality and reality .. As for what this book concerns, the writer made a great effort but I Personally guy R was convinced of his conclusion, and if there were some things mentioned that deserve more study, such as backfilling in China .. Generally I evaluated the book with two stars for the effort made and another star because it opened up new horizons for his trips in China and the Maldives.
I will not repeat the experience. What I liked most is the site only .. The bathroom is very small, there is no personal comfort because the apartments are connected to each other through the doors of all the sounds heard. I did not feel comfortable
Tired of reading. The translation is poor, which is why I stopped reading it. But I liked the biography of the priest.
I will not try to enter it again. Its proximity to the Prophet&#39;s Mosque. No system
This novel reminds me, if properly called, a book of the stone of patience by Atiq Rahimi. This is a theatrical clip, not a novel. A theatrical clip based on a telephone conversation between a man and a woman; the dialogue permeates the voice of a third man, who appears to be standing behind the shadows, explaining the course of things between the interlocutors. Dialogs rise and fall, fade and energize, in which there is not much boredom and boredom
A very simple book. He talks about the world of the blind and. About some of the creators of them. The best of the book. He is only talking about the inventor Muhannad Abu Dayyeh. In fact, I was disappointed. The title is much larger than the content of the book. I benefited from some good information. But he went astray and did not come up with any new idea. We split the book copies of other books. There were no strong ideas. I don’t know why we are the blind choir yet.
In the name of of Allah the Merciful. In principle, I am the first time to work a review on a novel, even though I am a fan of novels, and with different expressions for each author in each novel, I do not consider any novel as bad as long as I came up with a benefit or an imagination that made me happy and happy. But this novel, in particular, I was waiting for it on the hottest of embers, after of course what Heba experienced and saw its masses. But this novel was so hard that I used to spawn in the days in order to be saved, I felt that you were dying slowly. There is an unusual and unexpected amount of that from the writer. Frankly, I expected it to be stronger than that. But I, as a reader, felt that the writer of the novel de Gap was repentant and misled me with it. Of course, the cover is a masterpiece, especially in the deadly heat that we have in it. We enter, remained on the topic of the novel, and Hussein Aref, who is running on ten reasons for life, and made a page on Elvis to share his adventures and work by describing our depth and the philosophy of death and death is the only victor ... and if love is stronger than death, prove ... unique sentence Minyaawi times word Prove de. She is the one who kept it the length of the novel, and it proves .. And, frankly, with his consent, I was not satisfied with a reason. The novel revolves around the philosophy of death, and frankly, philosophy de Makhlenich is already thinking. And what is supposed is philosophy is an invitation to thought. Negi stayed for one day, she wanted to die herself and wanted, but a pill of encouragement ... She said to Hassan, who wants to prove her that he is a friend of hard and went to Hussein to encourage her to die together ... Azaa escapes her life from her traitorous, traitorous, without honor ... And the writer must reconsider
My first stop with Marquez was with this account, which talks about the village where corruption and misuse of civil and religious authorities are rampant, reviewing the stories of many personalities such as the mayor, priest, doctor, and others .. The large number of characters and names confused me to events.
A novel I loved you too much. I heard a lot about her and her magnificence, so I read it to make sure that it is true ... Reading it does not require much time, even though it contains more than a page ... The style of the writer is beautiful .. It has similarities and paragraphs of his masterpieces .. But the novel did not like me and is not as wonderful as many claim ... The title was enough to sum up all this stupidity in the name of love found in the novel ... It seems that all clumsy behaviors and away from morals, sins, humiliation and humiliation are affixed to love, so I decided not to read any book that puts love as a title for him ..
This novel has more trash bin than library shelves
Oi monster:
At the beginning of my reading of the book, I felt for the first time that Dr. Mustafa Mahmoud was unsuccessful in writing this book, but this feeling began to fade as soon as I read a book, a good book but something is missing, perhaps.
nothing . nothing. everything
Misplaced misplaced. The furniture is new only. Place, value, attitudes, and lack of respect for the person or guest
business trip . . Hotel location and cleanliness
I did not like the stay. Breakfast. After him from the women&#39;s gate, three times I also asked to clean the room and nobody came
Very weak. The beach is clean breakfast. The service is bad, the chalet is filthy, and there is no safety for the door
Change to bad, why? . . Rooms are not furnished, floors, cleanliness is not good, demand and urgency
You should pay more attention. nothing. Lack of apartments and lack of a prompt response when servicing
There is nothing wrong . Close to the Emirates Mall. And the smell of smoke smelled of the receptionist who the evening period narrowed the apartment, knowing that we are just sisters and my younger brother
I do not think it deserves to be on the short list of the Arab Poker Prize. The idea may be good, but the treatment and creation of a group of inconsistent and inconsistent events made it far from being a good novel.
disappointing. . Wi-Fi reception kit at the customer&#39;s expense
Applebee&#39;s restaurant applies to it a saying of a civilization that prevailed, then it seemed they were one of the best restaurants and varied dishes.
I tried to get lost quickly, despite his freshness. My culture differs from strange terms in the book. Because I am Syrian, and my dialect tends to Shami. I can say that it is a book for Egypt in this era
The general atmosphere is sad but without meaning ... Few are expressions of deep meaning
Hotel not fit for human use. Nothing. I sat for less than half an hour and left the hotel due to lack of hygiene and lack of respect and paid the full amount of the reservation. The place is not adding a mattress. The bed mattress has stains, and the place is not clean. Even the empty cup of coffee contains sticky coffee residue. I found a small hair on the floor of the cup. Upon leaving the hotel the first thing the employee discussed was the value of the two-day non-refundable reservation.
This book contains a small amount of wisdom, but it is one of the books of Paulo Coelho in which he advocates the practice of magic, which is what I reject in the writings of Paulo
not good . well. Services
I had a laugh. What is it?
disappointing. Enter the Wild Water Canyon. The room design is uncomfortable and expensive, knowing that there are hotels at the same price, but much superior
Very CNN. . The rooms are very uncomfortable and old in furniture, there are no private satellite channels, and the employee asked him to change the room with a double bed as I requested during the reservation and did not work on it. I booked the room for two nights and left after the first night
For me ..... the novel is very, very boring ..... despite my admiration for the narrative style ... but the events and the projections ... are too many for boredom. This is, however, that the writer hates the Islamists provocatively ... and conveyed his hatred within the chapters of the novel chapter by chapter .. this changed projections on certain personalities characterized by integrity. This is the first novel I read to God, Ibrahim. I will not be able to have an integrated opinion on the writer until after trying to read another novel.
Substandard services. . Services are inappropriate and fall short of the hotel name
Tired on all sides. nothing. The reservation amount was deducted before arrival at the hotel and then the same amount was reserved as insurance without my knowledge
Did I really not read why I understood the amount of hatred, hatred and negative energy that the book sends on my face, why did all this challenge? Why all this hate? Why are you hardly forgetting and pain? When I hurt the image of the beloved, we forgot how much I hated this book. I don’t know when I felt, and dreams were continuing in describing how good and loving she is and helps others and her friends, and how she attaches her life to others and this kind of boasting, but after that the book increased in my opinion a question that his wife sent in me an energy of hatred for men that has no limits. I did not like the many analogies in the book, so two lines did not pass, and their letters were filled with the complex analogy that makes me get lost in words ... I wished that the style was simpler than that. I see from my point of view that a person without a memory as a person does not exist .. Why do we not only accept the truth of desertion and keep these beautiful memories inside us ... How stupid is that we hate one day who loved us. I never liked the book
She came out of the world strange as she came to her
Excellent and imminent
disappointing. There is no. The rooms are very old and I had to change the room three times
As for me, I am full. With all reasons to leave. It is not mine .. I am not mine. I am not mine. Certainly, I have come across a lot of phrases that resemble road signs ... worth the stand and meditation. But the experience of reading the mural in general was not successful .. This is to be honest with me, nothing more. . The text is full of historical references that I do not know ... and it is, in my opinion, the most important pillar of its understanding and interpretation that leads to pleasure. . The agreement to fully admire the likeness of everything the adults write confuses me ... but so far he cannot lose my confidence in my own tastes that concern me alone.
We can divide the book into two parts. The first part talks about the caliphate and the beginning of the intellectual conquest and secularization from the inside and took three pivotal figures and presented their differing opinions and changed them, namely Sheikh Ali Abdel Razek, Taha Hussein and Muhammad Hussein Heikal, although the focus was on Sheikh Ali Abdel Razek&#39;s controversial book, Islam and the origins of governance and presented The book against him is reprehensible to his refutation, and in my opinion, he did not display the book neutrally, so whoever did not read Islam and the fundamentals of judgment will have a very bad image according to Muhammad’s description of his architecture in this book, therefore I prefer to read that book before this, in general this topic is controversial and has been around intellectual discussions Even continuing Today, of course, the part that he presented did not understand his right, the second part on the suspicions usually raised by secular regimes and their response to them, even though most of his responses are weak and weak for those who see the conditions in the current situation, and I will address two points first in the issue of atonement as he claims that in the past no one has atoned anyone despite Intellectual differences that were taking place and was based on some incidents at the time, but he neglected other stances, such as what happened to scholars and philosophers such as Abu Bakr Al-Razi and others at the hands of people at that time, and of course in our present time there is no easier than atonement, the second point the point of the Islamic system and the caliphate and the extent of Beauty of this system and that Inheritance and the king were not inside, but they entered and the question that arises is why I adopt a system that opens the door to tyrants and I can take a system that does not allow this subject .. From my humble point of view we need to create a system by ourselves that combines our strength as East and the progress and strength of the West and does not allow us to drown in Their materialism, nor drowning in our myths and this system, I did not find between the two sides of this book
Spelling mistakes are many: / ... the end is dramatic, somewhat better
A book that talks about ideas that are applied during reading, a book that is boring and rewarded God when I read it from lashes to lashes
Frankly, I did not enjoy this book and there are many points that I did not understand and there are other points that I think are found only in science fiction books and films based on them and difficult to achieve in practice and we have not reached it yet and it may be that my lack of understanding of this book is that I am not familiar with all the physical theories and I am not interested By searching in this field
I wish I could have been better. The presence of a garage and near the campus. Cleanliness and buffet is very poor. Room cleanliness is not regular daily
I was a local student, it is important, except for one of the sitting customers screaming screaming, we do not have a sweaty pulp, I love to see the past, but I have previously seen it only in the center of chickpeas and it was of the same type many outside the important place that I got up and left eating for them
The chicken that dreamed of flying How could it be the best-selling book. In any case, it seems that the Koreans have another opinion .... Initially, the title attracted me, but I did not see where her dream lies in the flight that she discovered before her death. Perhaps if the title was the chicken that I dreamed of being a mother, it would be more realistic ... Far from the title that took me a lot if we moved to the text and found it very similar to the symbolic story in the book of the monk who sold the Ferrari car to Robin Sharma. Where the story entrenches some values, of course, it will be easy to remember it with a story ... You must have a dream to pursue. Focus on your goal, try to find ways to achieve it, and avoid fear. Always strive to provide your needs, despite everything. Freedom and dreams will not make sense if we do not succeed in finding a suitable life partner and a true friend who will support us. Sometimes doing the right thing leads you to take the road alone. The good that you do will turn and get back to you from the gender of the act you provided. Different from the squadron, at first, it will be rejected. Others do not accept the difference. Ask yourself what you really want and not what the ocean dictates. Know your talents and strengths and use them to enhance your position in your community and surroundings. Finally, behind every evil behavior there is often a reason why its owner cannot find a better solution. Valuable things do not last long. What is the challenge of reading a book? Asian book writer class
Very weak. Breakfast is inappropriate.
There is nothing tastier than being the hero of yourself, to defeat the refraction of your soul, your helplessness, and your helplessness that I fed you with milk, to fill your deficiency, which has become part of his corrupt doctrine, that. This life passes a brave woman, knows what she wants, and knows exactly how to get it. Such a woman is afraid of cowards by men, and empty women are jealous of her
disappointing. . The pictures shown on the book do not match the smell of smoking
Dislike . nothing. everything
A very ordinary book .. Perhaps because I was expecting him to have deeper ambiguity .. and raised it even more so that I was invested in reading it .. And about the young boy who was murdered .. So this was actually expected from the first crime he killed
It seems that all the novels nominated for the Poker Prize follow the same approach, starting well and attracting the reader, and that gradually decreases as we merge into reading until we reach the end word, so thank God. This is what happened to me in that novel, I do not deny that I was drawn in the beginning with the first pages and I liked the idea, especially the first part of it, and even with the first personality mentioned, but after that I found nothing new but gossip that is useless and even I feel that the writer himself went out of The framework of his idea is in a lot of pages, just to fill out the pages, as if the award does not nominate anything but the quality of the works, which is proven true in many of the candidate narrations .. The idea is good, but the method of processing came badly to destroy everything and make me feel bored enough to make me skip a lot of pages It is the behavior that I found I was doing towards a lot of For poker works. I may be mad at the writer, but what makes me act in that way is the presence of that novel in the poker list, even if it does not reach the short, but its nomination from the beginning makes me strike five fifths in a sixth, but it is not surprising, this is the usual with those in charge of that strange prize .. two stars are enough
Bad . nothing. And dirty dirty dirty walls dirty land dirty smoke smell everywhere the smell of the bathroom is disgusting and inside the room the voices of restoration from dawn annoying air conditioner very annoying dirtiest hotel with the life that his cell paid them they refused to take back and went to a second hotel
I was expecting it would be much better. The best of the poems in the poems of Ahmed Al-Najjar and Mustafa Ibrahim:
A petty tale about adventure with a trivial story. And it is not fanaticism for the Arabic, the eloquence of the Arabs, their eloquence and their briefness of meanings in a verse of poetry instead of writing a book. He had preceded the idea of the foretold book when he said. And whoever feared the rise of generations, lives forever between the pits
Umrah. Proximity to the sanctuary. Filth and dirty rooms, worn out bathrooms, deactivating air conditioners, and not turning them on. Can I say miss a heck of a hotel? I would never recommend booking it.
How to write a story, a very faction. The expressions and voices that you write in the dialogue, as if you were actually working, that separates the reader from enjoying the events of the novel between the lack of focus and the two chapters I read the book not at all fun. And if he was in an idea and a story that he met very well with a genius narration, I think the writer Muqdarsh brings me to the first stages of delving into the idea, then the idea. I will never think of it again. But because the book is done like any certain movie scenario, we will simplify it as a movie
And if it was a philosophical novel of the highest style for some, but its language was bad for me, so the Egyptian language is spoken, audible, eloquent and beautiful more than it is read. For me, I even took it with me everywhere to get rid of it and read it in every vacuum .. All that the novel added to me was that it deeply inserted me into the Egyptian neighborhood until I felt the atmosphere of poverty, its pain, the simplicity of people and their familiarity, and this is the good.
C place to stay with a great location. Location only. Reception and standard of cleanliness and no workers for loading purposes
Created in a novel in December, all dreams come to an end. As for this novel, love is innocent of it, and its most beautiful title is nothing more
I did not like the translation ..
Not the best for me at all I stayed here on a half board offer during June and promised June. Consumer hotel. The rooms are in rather poor condition, for example the whole metallic paint frayed on the bathroom fixtures, bird waste on the balcony, it was so hot that the balcony was not used. The staff was rude, or did not understand what we were asking for additional pillows that required a two-day wait and demand times. The food was very average, just nutrition, not food. Breakfasts are ok, but dinner was not fun at all. Same food every day. Drinks are very expensive. TL for a small beer EUR. Hotel facilities were very good. Several swimming pools, sauna and Jacuzzi were needed because the bed was solid Turkish bath, nice gardens but services were lacking. The fantastic tour guide said that the hotel was excellent in the past. However, the German owners sold him to a local Turkish company that did not invest in the hotel. Likewise, the multilingual staff were German, Russian and British guests, and management was non-existent. Elsewhere, we found that the Turkish people were really kind and helpful, but not here
disappointing. Unfortunately, I did not like anything, and a tip for God that no one thinks about living in it. . The situations are not enough. The staff are from the sisterly Republic of Egypt, but they do not represent this country of origin, and they treat them badly. . There is no cleanliness. . There are no towels, soap, or shoes for the bathroom. . There is no electricity near the bed. . The design of the hotel is very old.

uncomfortable . . The room service is very bad and there is no response from the reception to the customer&#39;s requests in addition to that some of the reception staff do not deal seriously with the customer&#39;s complaints, as the room cleaning is not done on a daily basis where I stayed three days and no one cleaned the rooms even though I spoke with the room service workers about cleaning The room after I left but when I go back I find it as I left it
This is an extension of his book. Women and language. And I talked more about him, and in this book, al-Ghafami is still trying to prove his theory that the man seized the language and controlled it so that he reminded her, excluding the feminization of it ... Even when the woman spoke, she spoke in a male language .... But the culture of illusion felt it deeper and more enjoyable because it was applied and dropped on texts .... And I liked very much his talk about Ibn Al-Qayyim and Al-Nafzawi and the difference between their books on love ... very very much his talk and his analysis is beautiful ... it seems that the idea evolved with Al-Ghazami more ... However, the book suffers from repetition and exaggeration also ... and what I still did not find his theory convincing at times, and his analyzes of evidence seemed to be overwhelming for many of them to prove what he went to ... and another reader can analyze it differently and come up with a counter-result .... Therefore, the same notes that I wrote about his first book are made for this second. I only have a small note that suppressing it will bitter my bitterness ... This book&#39;s cover seems to me to be extremely naive ... I did not understand what is the relationship between the subject and this European farming that displays horseradish ... Does this mean that the culture of femininity and masculinity is as delusional as the taste of horseradish? Who is tasteless? Even if it was a European horseradish, in the end it will never remain a tasteless one. :
Strong and bold language, free from traditional metaphor. This is a group feature. What clearly defects the group in my judgment is the ambiguity that does not serve the idea. . In the end, the language in which the author writes needs an idea and narrative techniques that fit the idea. So she knows her contextual dimensions while taking alerts of readers and book friends. In consideration, she will have a place as much as her talent.
Very weak. A very narrow hotel, very bad.
This is his motto, which I can say on it, and God doesn’t have anything but oil and dough. What is the flavor of the sauce or the flavor of basil or thyme? I just need dough, oil, and my meat every week.
disappointing. . I did not like the presence of insects on the family, thank God it is just a night and I slipped my reservation with them as well as their location is bad for the amount per night
I would have liked the splendor of a sunset oasis. But unfortunately I did not find. Were it not for me, I wouldn&#39;t like to see a book in the text, I would have liked it. It contains a part, but I liked the gap between the hero’s relationship and his cousin. And his accurate depiction of Oasis customs, especially respect for the elder brother and his status in the father&#39;s position. Just a silly end, in my view. This does not revive, I Hqari Tani by Bahaa Taher
disappointing. . I waited hours to work for Check In, and the employee had bad manners
Interesting, but the Idiot&#39;s happy ending didn&#39;t like me.
For the first time, I got very bored when reading to Youssef Zidan. I put the novel from my hand before I finished it. Wait better than this.
disappointing. The location is ok. The hotel cancels the reservations executed through the site and makes a different amount of reservations. Very bad management. Unfortunately the reception is strange. It is one of the well-known hotel names. Very bad treatment.
disappointing. The place is beautiful and clean. In the beginning, the work team dealt very badly, noting that the treatment between the Gulfs and foreigners treated them better with foreigners, as if they gave charity to us with some of their own money. Even when I called the room service, they did not improve the deal. Many inmates found in the lobby complaining that they were late for more than an hour despite arriving after the scheduled time for admission.
I lost my time ......
Exactly what I said about the pros and cons
Is this how forgetfulness is. I think Ahlam drafted this book to remind herself to forget
disappointing. Close to the sanctuary. The hotel is very old
Thank God for visiting the Noble Sanctuary. Dealing.
Abdul Rahman Munif always writes his novels, but this novel was not as expected
Weak. . The furniture is old / insects are spread in the rooms, toilets and on the buffet of authorities / toilets emit an unpleasant smell / construction workers work on the first floor, which causes continuous inconvenience / the room lacks the simplest services Because it is in a very crowded street, and the inconvenience of cars reaches the rooms / meeting room, poor air conditioning, hot dining table in the session, the quality of the food is poor, even coffee and tea tastes bad.
To love you means. I wake up at the end of dawn. To make you the first name in a prayer and see. Find out the response times. Hit the Lord to make you king
There are no aesthetics in the written texts. I do not know whether this is from the translator or from the writer herself, as it resembles regular hadiths, not to mention the atmosphere of depression that hangs over her.
You are wrong if you think that you will read a novel about two children, both of whom suffer from the ravages of war .... the sound of shells ... the roar of artillery ... the bombing of planes ... I realize that the ravages of war may leave scars in lives if you do not take them. But I was reading a novel punctuated by many scenes that revoke disgust and nausea .... Two children and two boys ... I know only the cruelty and extreme selfishness that makes you wonder whether they really are two children. Sorry ... a simple question ... ?? .... Why are the high ratings for this novel?
It was decided to prepare the words of Heri Mallouche, that is, necessary and fraud for many needs. And did not we say the end of the character that everyone knew?
The book, its style, is very impressive. And the way of writing is not all the content I like. Topics are arranged in a very random way. But in general, it&#39;s a book that&#39;s fine and sure with this method, which is the best:
I have nothing to say except that this court is insignificant in the fullest sense of the word
disappointing. Delivery service to the campus. The room size is very narrow, with the number of beds
Friendly staff, narrow rooms, and an empty dishwasher. The staff are friendly. The bed is small, the restaurant is very crowded, the dishes are empty, the refrigerator is empty, the safe box does not work
The title of the novel is Azazel, which has taken on a name greater than its value .. In my opinion, it does not deserve this name, fame and waste of time, it revolves around instinct and flight from responsibility. I do not consider it a creative work as some think, and it is not worth reading either because of its pornographic clips ... I stopped reading it and could not complete it when its moral level began to fall to the bottom. As for the historical information, I did not see any historical information in this novel, I did not benefit from it or get out of it at least with a good idea about it or the writer who shocked me after this novel I will not read any work by the writer Yusef Zidan
Unfortunately, the best thing about the site only. I did not like anything in it. Cleanliness, handling, breakfast, staff, hotel maintenance, parking, and everything I liked but the location of the hotel
An ordinary novel that revolves around an old police framework that is covered in the Saidi atmosphere, which is loved by most people. Written by Fathi Ghanem, Yassiloub is closer to my report, as there are no aesthetic pictures or descriptions of the monuments of the mountain and the characters of its residents. In the pre-revolution period, the novel is about the people of the mountain who refuse to go to the model village that the government created for them because of his desire to continue curettage in order to reach the hoped-for treasure. A simple novel and it is said that it turned into a movie that did not coincide with the expected success
A star I give it to the character of Dyar and the style of Alwan. As for the rest of the stars, it is crushed by the events of the monotonous novel and the personality of Nasser Al Rakhwa.
One of the times that I was struck by a novel with a hard novel, the story is boring, dispersed, there is no single thread that can be traced, absurd, to the most distant, for them to the paradise, which they made.
Without knowing the events, there is no benefit from it, the last scrapbook is possible. I understood and remembered the events articles for Egyptians only
The last time I got off at this place. . I booked a room for individuals and suddenly they are only individuals and reported about it .. Present, God willing, and so nothing was done which forced me to use the sofa instead of a bed during the three nights of residence ... even the room other than the one I was blocking .. very bad situation
I will not repeat his visit again. The bed is just comfortable. Cleanliness and services are poor
I wish I did not stay in this hotel and do not recommend it. . Dealing is slow and I had a problem. I gave them news before I came to them and spoke to them after I came to them and I got up and did not solve my problem and I will present it to the Ministry of Trade and to integrity and the Monitoring and Investigation Commission is an insult that I did not expect and I am about to publish this act on a local newspaper
Literary disaster
Lovely hotel, bad service. I liked the location, breakfast, suite space and honesty. I did not like the reception. It was bad and uncooperative, as well as cleaning services. Anything you ask for will not come to you until an hour or so. You must repeat the request.
I am very weak when talking about mothers. To remember me with a mother to tell me when she&#39;s older. With the stick, she woke me up to go to school. Or talk to me that I am a troubled child and I was kidnapping my brothers&#39; games. The kids are calling from the neighbors&#39; house and on the days of Eid you put it in my hand. Availability of money that was not in my first graduation ceremony to guide my degree. And she would not be in my marriage ceremony to take a group photo and she will not be. And I received my first child after months. Everything we can do in life is only the mother we can. To visit the whole world, marry the most beautiful women, and collect much money. And to have fun, to love, to write, to sing, to learn, to be beautiful and to desire. We revolt and placate, we can do everything but make. As for one. It was my wish to one day return from my university or work. And if I open the door of the house without ringing the bell, and tell a lady who looks like me and is waiting for me: Yummy Chew cook. ..................
Very failed. . The crew is not Moe
Bad and settled same day exit from the hotel. . The rooms are old in design, the adaptation is poor, and an engineer brought us no repair
International name in the specifications of a bad furnished apartment. The receptionist, whose name is Hussein, as well as the receptionist who was present upon our arrival, the breakfast buffet is excellent, close to the sanctuary, as it is about one meter away from the nearest door for men and the women&#39;s door is approximately one meter / in which an Egyptian employee is very cooperative when ordering food service. Lack of comfort in a science where the color of the carpet is dark in color, and despite that, it is clearly dirty on him / the bathrooms are dirty and there is no professional cleaning team or that the cleaning team without supervision / the walls of the rooms are without insulation so the voices of your neighbors are yours, the refrigerator is empty / whoever lives in Mövenpick will be shocked at the level of this hotel Personally, it is an experience that I will not repeat / in which a Pakistani employee has almost when you ask for anything. I will tell you in a clear Arabic language. I speak Arabic. And if love speaks Arabic, it speaks better than any Arab /
Weak. . The breakfast was very bad and not suitable for the Khaljah, and it must be changed from all types and I lived in it for days and did not break the fast, as well as from poor service. In the hotel, please develop in the hotel, knowing all the hotel will have dedicated parking for the hotel
I liked the story of the veil, and the story of the abyss and the victim sadden me. But I did not like repetition and repetition in the stories of love and exaggerated God
Very bad, I felt I was a cow from Wikipedia or any search on Google
Surface book in scarves and weak and the two stars only for Anna and only in listing some points in a way I had not seen before. I see that Mostafa Mahmoud is writing that is suitable for the public and that it is historical writings that are specific to the seventies and do not fit with the current challenges
I read this book specially because I respond to one of my companions who are almost convinced of atheism, but after what I read the book, he provided the questions in my brain, despite my conviction that atheism is a life of bohemian, which is not mentioned in the book.
. The place is spacious and tidy. The Wi-Fi is very tired, and what makes you want a bed for the children
Very weak. . The apartments are not in the pictures that are completely on-site.
I never enjoyed the book. The writer tries to imitate the American writers, but the tradition is very unsuccessful, which made the story suitable for children and teenagers. What made me worse is my version of the worst, typos, misfortunes, and errors in arranging papers
I need a second reading, but the book of songs of sin and innocence is better than him.
Worn out hotel. Proximity to the Prophet&#39;s Mosque. The furniture is old, the bathrooms are ballet, and the hotel standard in general does not rise to the level of stars
Very boring is a single story that is more than a diary
My second reading to the writer after Qais, Leila and the Wolf, and I think the last.
Weak. Close to the Prophet&#39;s Mosque, especially for women. The hotel is unsuccessful in all respects and does not deserve, nor is the star, air-conditioners do not work, furniture is worn out, cleanliness is very bad and the restaurant is bad eating and delays in delivery of rooms, although my reservation is not refundable.
The group started a strong start with broadcasting very good stories, then followed by stories that are closer to Ahmat Ahm than to stories such as intersecting circles that wrap each other in. You can see the beginning from the end. Unfortunately, I did not like the storyteller Khairi Shalaby as much as I love the novelist Khairy Shalaby.
I previously said that I could not complete it. Indeed, I did not complete it. I feel nauseous every time I try to read it again. I respect his symbolism, but I regret his style.
Perish
very bad . And nothing. Everything in the hotel needs maintenance, the elevator, air conditioning, toilets, moved in more rooms, unfortunately, each unit is worse than the other
I tried it only once, the branch next to the intersection of Fateh Makkah and Al-Sittiya, we got very bad Mandi meat
I see his level and quality this year is less I call his departments. Attention to quality versus speed of service and discharge
Superficial and boring .. You shocked me so hard .. enough star to name the hero and heroine:
I did not like the style of the novel, nor the end at all. The plot is not a court of the late, a unique case and an exceptional situation, but that the novel ends as a psychopath end. I felt that the writer did not find what seals the novel with it, so he put the idea of mental illness, we cannot overlook the ingenuity of expressions in some words despite There are some provocative expressions
I think that the evaluation of the book goes without saying
Slight Oooooowoo .. To the point of boredom sometimes ... Two stars, but for the sake of a chapter, forget that:
Weak. . The room is very dirty, it lacks cleanliness greatly, and we paid a full day for an hour only.
The book is distracted and contains repetition and jumping to conclusions in an inappropriate manner .... but it deals with an important topic which is the illusion of scientific miracles in the sacred heritage ..... The book has some exaggerations and some topics that are not related and that the writer listed for personal purposes perhaps .. Among the book&#39;s flaws is its restriction on dealing with the mostly Egyptian reality ... and reaping it and mocking Saudi medical achievements ...
If I liked the way he thanked Ali Shukri and the way he cleared himself of betraying his country and maintaining his image in front of his son Yahya, and his abundant love for his son. However, I did not like the book because it looks at the future of Egypt with a black look, because Egypt, the Lord, protects it, and Egypt will not go out, God willing, from the Great January Revolution to wider potholes, as the writer predicted, so the end will not end in the occupation and war.
C. nothing. everything
Weak. Good reception. There is an unpleasant smell in the apartment, the furniture is old, there are no services, and the price is expensive compared to the hotel
Bad service and maintenance. Also, I had a chance to visit Blue Ginger this September with my friends. It was a very bad experience. At a time when the long road and the picturesque location of the resort raises the imagination of any nature lover, the infrastructure and the quality of the rooms were in a miserable state, the smell of mold came out of the room and plaster from the ceiling was falling. Unfortunately, the fungus covered the bed and the pillow. At the same time, we sympathize with the staff at the place. The resort itself is located in a rainy area, and this does not mean that the inmates are forced to accept this bad service. In terms of price, it is the right of any guest to expect better facilities and services. I decided not to write anything about food, there is not much to write about. The food was simply boring, and at times pathetic and unpalatable. In short, you can stay at your own risk, and it is not recommended for groups with children.
We cannot reform people&#39;s morals by preaching and advice along the lines of what the ancients used to do in the past. Ethics is a product of the social conditions that surround it. Unless these conditions change, we do not hope that morals will change, as we like. Thus, the saying of one who is not living is true .. his morals change
What benefits neither the youth nor the families. nothing. Everything
A family from Riyadh. There is nothing to be commended. There are no stops at all and you have to find a stop outside the hotel area
Weak. Location. Poor service, clean room, and bathroom are not good and the hotel does not deserve two stars and I would not recommend it
Quite a bit of clarity and simplicity and very casual events
disappointing. Location. Hygiene and public services
As I read it, I thought that the paper was black..the writing on it was black..and I was shocked that I was in a black world. I was not sure it was just a novel except when I looked at what was around me. I am still in a state of alertness and sleep, even after I completed it days ago
One of the worst things I&#39;ve ever read in my entire life
Black befitting your. A love story for psyche:. An extreme view of extremism. I was disappointed, expecting a better level, and my problem is that I read it after a general novel waiting for death. I did not like the environment of the novel, which he desires and craves, and the glasses of champagne and others ... By the end of the novel, I decided that it was the first and last novel that I read to Mostaghanem
One or two stars ??. I will put two stars ... a star: Because the suspense factor was active in this novel, as you will be able to finish it in a day or two .. This is, in my opinion, a factor that has some strength .. Another star: because the writer worked on his novel with research and investigation and this was more clear than Perhaps necessary. Now we come to the novel&#39;s weaknesses: First: The novel was overflowing with colloquialism in an exaggerated manner. I love the novels that take you in the ordinaryness of the country until it enters into the real atmosphere. Like the novel Al-Madhoun and Madame from Tel Aviv. You feel really in the hollow of Gaza between the people and the Palestinians. But here with this blue elephant. It was like a teenage novel that many words were written in English. Can you imagine such a sentence in a poker-nominated novel? . Taki ... but this is a victory ... and. . Originally, Maya was answering from him. . He is in Maadi .... Wait, I have my phone. . . Yes, it is a novel that reached the short list in Poker. Second, it appears to me that the author here was not convinced that this was a pure police novel. So he wanted to make it a power of legends, flowery words, and psycho-medical information. Love, isthmus and death .... up to a degree that is not enough for salvation, and I arrived after the first page, praise be to God. Third: Am I the only one who felt this, or was there anyone else. He felt that the writer was practicing the muscles of his information and language, if you will, to the reader. For me, I cannot stand this act. The writer who sees himself higher than his reader, his writing becomes narcissistic. It came with new language styles and phrases, but it added nothing to the language, not even to the novel. We return to our basic point that this narration is destined to be police, not linguistic, philosophical. Also, the reader is not required to be a psychiatrist to know the meanings of the medical terms included in the novel. It would not detract from the novel that the explanatory notes were added to the aforementioned types of diseases. Although I am against mixing English with Arabic. Three stars decreased out of five ... I think I will be satisfied with this amount. The novel is light, had it not been for the preoccupations that I mentioned before
I did not like it because the author made herself the focus of the book, and unfortunately her case did not
Hotel management is bad, especially the hotel&#39;s general manager, Mr. Yahya. . The style of receptionists and even their manager, Mr. Yahya is bad. They have no respect for the guest or the art of dealing as you find in most of the world’s hotels.
The writer’s language is beautiful and gentle, and his description is fascinating. I stress that his language is more than beautiful .. Also, the cover of his novel is very attractive.
Not for a new couple. . The customer service staff is not for two bugs
The first novel I read to the writer. I did not like the style, the events, the whole story. I felt bored as I waited for the end, until I was shocked. The story was more like fiction or perhaps less than the novel is it sideburns. Did I not seek a new addition to the idea of the jinn being connected to our own world, we humans, and I do not know whether it was real at all? I wished to be interesting as its title, but my expectations failed
disappointing. . It does not deserve a residence in it and the quality of the population is not good
Poor hotel and management is worse. nothing. A bad method of swindling where a sum was reserved and when the Czechs came, the apartment was thoroughly searched to search for something broken to fine me any amount and when there is everything healthy, you pretend that I will be tempted because I extinguished his cigarette in the hall, which means smoking inside the apartment, and this is forbidden according to the hotel policy knowing that I I asked the two receptionists for an apartment for smokers and he gave me an apartment with a balcony and told me the receptionist Riyadh you can smoke on the balcony and I was fined a dirham because of the presence of a cigar inside the fire and I was blackmailed by the employee that the fine will be reduced to and he intended to Bakhshish and explained the subject to the Emirati manager and his name was I think Maher It was a bad deal or Balasah does not hide him any kind of administration ultimately would not recommend this hotel at all housing where prevent smoking and allow young people Balzairat apartments
Dialogues mixed with colloquial dialects mixed with very disturbing English vocabulary ... exaggerated analogies and disgusting events made me nauseous..but I prejudiced myself for the sake of the novel&#39;s idea ... the idea that I wish I had continued at its pace ... a psychiatrist committed a crime to be locked up in the hospital to prove whether He is mentally ill..or he is an accomplished actor who succeeded in exonerating himself..but the end ... the end is tragic ... stupid ... very much. The only star for just a few emoji phrases I liked.
I am completely convinced that the thinker Mustafa Mahmoud is much better than the novelist Mustafa Mahmoud. I think that this is a novel that is not what I expected, but it is rather good, dealing with a problem that is still thorny so far, which is the sheikhs, making them good guardians, the problem of lack of money, individuals seeking it, thinking about things that are forbidden, and thinking about betraying the brother to the brother and eating the forbidden that does not last. But it is a good overall. Done, thank God
Very weak. nothing. The first time I see a hotel in every room a family but you are inside the Indians room.
If you did not read the novel, try to read this review. I was very excited about the novel and was ready for it ... its beginning is sensual, it is like stories of horror-stalking, death tremors and funny needs de ... P-text has increased rumen and has increased the speed of events and excitement ... but the last hill remained
Rude handling. I heard about the hotel, and I had a visit to it two days before writing this comment. The reception staff were not rude in dealing at all ,,, saluting them and nobody greeting you ,,, arrogant and indifferent to customers ,,,,, I hope people convey the image and realism of the hotel ,,,,
The worst hotel I&#39;ve ever seen. I did not like anything in the hotel. I would like to take two hours exactly and we come to Abu Dhabi and those who want to give me the rooms because I do not have the original ID I have a Cuban in the mobile and the solution I have is that I would go to the police station and I would like his testimony never to cooperate and their style was false even though I was speaking to the director and after I changed the reservation in the name of one of the companions and delayed the text of an hour because They give us the argument that they are suspicious of their cleanliness. They are supposed to be ready. We entered the hour, bedding, dust, and even the place of dead mosquitoes. The walker is not a five-star hotel.
Weak. . The internet is very bad, the furniture is old, and the site is far from all activities
A novel that seemed somewhat good and it could pull a hill of a cow ... In a text that expected its end and its events remained .. The description of the people is weak, it is noticed by the characters ... The dramatic plot is not convinced and very weak
Weak. I dislike bad neglect. Dealing and drainage and inconvenience rooms
Although the character of Muhammad Al-Rattyan is evident in the novel. However, the novel was not at the level you expected
I used to think that I would wish to live the village life when reading the novel, but the author portrayed the village’s life painful or painful, or perhaps it really is, I was looking for the values and morals that we are used to hearing about. Villages and I found very little. My desire to search for beauty in the village may have influenced my evaluation of her with a star, which is more worthy of my eyesight.
Too bad too. Almost the best thing is the price if a barrier before a period. Service is poor, delay in room delivery, food is very poor, I do not recommend this hotel
The shop its furniture is great and the site is vital and upscale and this is one of the reasons for the high prices, but it is not enough to justify the extra cost.
She didn&#39;t really like me much. This book was the outcome of the book fair in Riyadh .. The stories are so short that I felt distracted as I read them .. I wished they were a little longer and carry more meaning.
Very weak. . No Arabic speaking crew
Confusion is the dominant quality of all personalities, and if they have reached a point of success, except that they are faltering, faltering, they do not know from where .. Personally, I see that the work is a collection of anecdotal stories that were formulated to be a fictional work, by finding a link or meeting point between the characters and that point is The idea of alienation or the conditions of immigrants, and the writer intends to cut some experiments out of the large number of his travels, as I know, to clarify the hidden side of living outside the homeland, which is that the West or Europe is important to a paradise as they claim .. It was somewhat boring and the plot was not completely perfect, and this was due to the purpose of that group Anecdotal illustration is not a thrill of meaning That all the characters, with different conditions they belong to a single point, a confusion resulting from those represented by immigration writer point in a peaceful birthday feast, which did not come. Finally, the home is the place where you feel safe, and if you do not feel it, know that you are not in your country dear
Do you strip naked reality or market it? Winning the Booker is proof that the prize is empty and commercial
A nice book, which is about articles that explain Ahmed Helmy&#39;s personality as we knew her without making, I felt a lot of boredom and sleepiness during my reading .. The two stars because he was helping me sleep:
disappointing. The proximity of the hotel to the markets and a variety of buffet varied and delicious. The service is very slow. I waited for the bags to follow me after I left the hotel but did not go out of the room so I had to go by myself and bring them from the room as well. The hotel prices do not match the hotel level. I suggest that the hotel be a three-star only.
The novel has an ambiguous rate and an abnormal thriller .. I’m his village for almost two days. The method is not foolish. I say, I have a dazzling comment, because I did not have a profound effect, but only two sentences: Why did Adam not create ribs ... who said that money does not make happiness? They must not have intended other money ... I did not like the revelations and the clear statement mentioned the novel. Thank you .
Very bad hotel. Close proximity to the sanctuary is the only beautiful thing in it. The pictures on the site are different from the reality The service is poor The hotel is on a high place I do not recommend trying it
I do not recommend staying with it. The concierge is the only place to treat them with sophisticated reception. Increase in the price of stay. Surprises in which there is no cleanliness. We found old shoes under the bed, but they did not clean. Advice. Do not ask to eat from the hotel. Unbelievably and normal. Opening your eyes. Meeting the workers facing you from the window. The beds were uncomfortable.
Her style is sweet, and the way the events are presented is beautiful, but the story is a repeated topic from the first pages, we understand Kalshi and Basir Kalshi is repeated
disappointing. The place is good, close to Al Rashid and Dhahran Mall. The service is very poor, the services are very slow, the room is running in the hall, and the room smells bad
disappointing. Proximity to the sanctuary. The room smells very unpleasant, unbearable, but it was requested to change and took place on the second day.
Aso stay at the Sun and Sands Hotel. . Internet is not available for free in the rooms
This is the second book of this series The Chemistry of Prayer in this part The writer tells us about his reflections on the call to prayer and ablution and the five times of prayer and intent before starting to impose and enlarging and links all of this to the concept of comprehensive renaissance. Performing the role entrusted to him as the successor of God in his land ... There is a stretch in this book that makes me feel a little bored, despite the writer&#39;s ability to play with words, vocabulary and expression
Dislike . Eating tastes good, the satellite channels are complete, even though the TV dimmed the lighting. The internet is very slow, the passage has a very bad smell, shampoo and soap are used before, the balcony is very dirty, the food is exposed, the towel is dirty
Is bad. nothing. I liked nothing, neither the cleanliness nor the location and also the lack of parking
Very weak. . Honestly, the citizens&#39; employees treat them well, the day they call you before the check comes an hour in advance, and says, ‘Oh God, he excelled’ and on the day I tell him, ‘I’m grilling the text of an hour that satisfies him and speaks to you in a nice way, I’m honesty first and last time I live in this hotel
disappointing. Location and parking. Bad hygiene
Not worth five stars. Its proximity to the sanctuary. The level of service and hygiene is very low, the internet poor and the service bad
I did not feel anything throughout the novel .. No fun, no sympathy for the heroes. No big surprises ... a somewhat monotonous novel, but smooth and easy to find.
A group of words that any female will be mesmerized .. and whoever does not reach her will say to me, I read it
Simple style .. some ideas are deep and beautiful .. a lot of negativity .. and his idea of the country I never liked and I am against it
This site should not be included in site ads. nothing. Poor hygiene. The corridors are not clean. The kitchen is not clean. The toilet is not suitable
She is in situations that the truth laughed at me, but I never think that there are girls who are naively and descriptive, and it is true that I am not engaged, but if the betrothed speak so, then none of them are women, and God, the style is fun, but the story is very ridiculous
The level of service during this year decreased significantly. Location. Reception service, room service, housekeeping, and bathrooms are of a poor standard and quality breakfast buffet
The worst hotel I stay on during a business trip is the courteous reception staff, and so are the restaurant staff. No safety, so anyone who can enter and exit, whether from the hotel or not, has no control. I have many complaints, but no use, they will not improve.
I do not recommend. Value for money. Location, cleanliness, reception, handling I do not recommend
What you deserve ..... . Meals are not good ... there is no maintenance for the chalets ... the chalets are not clean ... bad
Emile Seuran&#39;s nuggets, some of which I liked, and what was clear about us before wrapping the context, including what was absurd or what is so vague you need to read the book that was completely part of it in order to enter into this state of unconsciousness in which that pessimistic philosopher wears you. Who talks more than once, that when we understand, we feel a deep lump that we can hardly pass through to death; but we neglect, forget, get involved in life. I feel that these selected quotes, leaves extracted from the mother tree to form small shrubs, true spirit, watered soul I did not find between the lines; so I prefer to read his books as he wanted for his writings.
I hope that Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi will take the lead in dealing. Wi-Fi Sih served lack. Dealing with the reception staff, and delay when arriving and leaving, not meeting an order
Weak. . Treat junk in the sense of the word I do not recommend it.
Water in the bathrooms. Quite quiet. The water, the bathrooms are so weak that they stopped, I had to follow the maintenance twice and try to fix and say, I don&#39;t know what the problem is, and when I called the reception, instead of what gives me a solution, I said all the bathrooms to me, because the hotel is the same
Bad and the address served hugely. Boring and similar to Twitter tweets.
Very bad stay. Close to the women&#39;s chapel only. Everything in and out is late, the hotel is not clean, exaggerated, the price is in addition, I am an executive wing barrier.
disappointing. The buffet. The service is transfer from and to the campus
There is a good poetic material .. But the bureau needs a lot of condensation, as I felt very bored in more than one poem .. There is nothing new in the diwan either in terms of the ideas presented by the poet and even the way of dealing with .. The imagination is very poor..I did not find any A picture that fascinates me only, a poem by Sebah A. The platform I liked .. Also there is a clear summons to the rhymes at the expense of meaning and I think this was one of my main reasons for boredom .. I hope to read again to the poet because I trust that the next experience will be much better.
Nothing excellent except cleanliness. Cleanliness only. Another person was given the same room and entered me. The room a worker from the parking service brought my car without asking and driving it recklessly and quickly, and he did not know that I was outside the hotel.
It was a waste of time to read them. It was my mistake that I should have stopped at that unforgivable mistake when his arm wrote its cultivation, so what did I expect from a writer who is not yet fluent in spelling?
I read to Ahmed what is stronger:
The place is annoying and the staff are not qualified. nothing. Everything is treated as pitched
A mysterious start that calls for reflection and contemplation in terms of the cemetery, the place chosen by the writer at the beginning of the Taliani story. In my imagination, he asked why he chose this place where everyone is equal, and then I found the seasons that followed were filled with ideological intercourse. The writer put himself in the maze of making characters, so you find inside the Taliani a personality who has a role in its pages, but those who served her are personalities only .. But after proceeding with it you found me stuck in many side issues and most of them are far from the event, the writer inserts sex as a tool for him in the novel but does not improve its use . His focus on women&#39;s freedom and opposition to Islamists has improved nothing. The use of the knowledgeable narrator present at the event greatly spoiled it. The best was to bring down the events of the 1980s on the current state of political turmoil in Tunisia ... easy language is present in a novel that reached the short list of the Poker Prize
I desire to leave the memory of everyone who knows me.
I felt it was a Facebook post, because I was so reckless. I thought of Hager, the need of men almost like Mars and women from Venus. Their children are more important in a better way
Weak. . The stupid reception responded to our time
Almost like everything I&#39;ve read for a novel, this novel belongs to a certain age group. I am certain that if I were younger I would have enjoyed it and started living with its characters an event event .. I do not say that the novel is bad but it is not what I expected to be, the division of the novel into chapters helps in understanding the story correctly but in the novel many characters in my opinion and that distracted my focus .. The story is good. It has some innovation. It made me watch a movie in some places, and this of course distinguishes the writer. Also, the writer’s style is very good and not steeped in literary methods and innovative goodies .. In his description of the characters sometimes almost distinguishes from the features of a person being good or evil which makes the novel in my opinion unconvincing .. I see that it took too long to reach a certain point, brevity was possible, but interfered In the novel there are side / minor characters and her stories are also told ..
A fair story .. I created the writer somewhat, but I see it exaggerated the manner of Jumana’s calling to her beloved Abdulaziz .. And there is no better way to enslave the woman and her will as it is the treatment of the protagonist to his sweetheart. Sufficiency in the last chapters of the novel, due to the large number of humiliation that he was exposed to on his hand
It started with suspense and ended with fools
The worst that you can see. I only like his site. There is no hot water in the toilets. Because the main heater is malfunctioning, so is the humidity that ate the walls of the apartment and the corridors. As a result, there were foul odors. But I want a hotel or hotel apartment in the same location.
Lack of interest in room service. Cleanliness. The laundry service is bad, they lost my clothes and they said, they will replace me and they have not compensated me yet
Progress is to grow humanity, not tools. To be in control of yourself, not with others. Have mercy, not strength. To welcome all ideas and words, even if they differ with you. What gives the world meaning is values, ideals and religion. To have a deeper goal than money, power and women
Yes.
It does not deserve stars or reservation. There is no. Lack of credibility, I booked a room for people and a family, but I was given a room with two beds, only poor handling of the reception desk and much delay and lack of interest.
The worst experience. . The reception is very bad. I will play with prices. The pictures are completely different from the realities needed to reach the apartment, which is a single residence
To this day, I am surprised how this novel won the Booker Prize .. a disgusting porn and a classic story between a bourgeois. The author was repeating the author in the repetition of the names that I did not remember him and Zina Bint Al-Henshir whose actions do not represent any forms of positive rebellion for a rural reality that the writer passed through the honored passage .. Actually strange. I did not find any wisdom in it except that wine is not mixed with fish or something like that .. I give it only a star
I will not go back to him again. I didn&#39;t order food. The location of the hotel is poor and the Africans are scattered at the hotel entrance disgustingly
This book ended for me with the end of the story of innocent Erendera and her ferocious grandmother. An anecdotal set of dark black outlook, depression, and chaos, a mysterious strange style that may have been spoiled by his translation? I hated repeating vocabulary too. I was unable to understand the significance of these stories, read some and left the rest. I do not recommend reading it at all:
Tamim poet, classical and enough
disappointing. Treat the reception staff. Classy. Sign-in and check-out speed too. The building is small, the rooms are also air conditioner, the annoying air conditioner, the Wii is very weak, the level of hygiene is poor and the services are available, and there is inconvenience in the rooms because the insulation is weak and the price is high for the service
The book is generally good, simple, smooth and fun. It gives you an idea how to deal with people through Gandhi&#39;s rule. The only drawback is writing colloquial rather than formal. But most importantly, how to communicate the idea:
I finished her reading after a delay and procrastination for months .. I could not relate the events, although they are all fanciful and mere preparations for a person called Hussam, and this is what the author explained at the end of the novel and what you may conclude during reading ... I thought there was no denying that there were some dialogues that I liked .. It may justify my dislike of it, as it is one of his first fictional attempts ... a purely personal opinion. :
It is not like what you expected .. its pale and cold despite the fact that the essence of the story is good and it was possible to reformulate it better than that ... the characters are confused and their names are very much ..
Beautiful literary phrases were .. but they are from one friend to another .. which made me pass the pages and do not care much ..
The tortilla meal is an old and valuable meal produced by Herfy restaurants, and the first thing that appeared was delicious and still ... It was then only riyal..So remember that it was presented in real basis .... Now unfortunately the meal has become in real riyals Cheese two riyals Ups = real .. I mean, taking advantage of your eyes, ... Of course, the rest of the meals, like the story ... advice, try a day when your prices come back to the first, and see the demand for you, but greed is blind
The writing style is very beautiful, creative writer with his words. When I started reading the novel, I liked it very much, but this admiration soon evaporated into rain filled with hate .. Hattan .. The protagonist hated him .. I hated his cheese and received it .. It is the model of the selfish, oriental Arab man full of feelings of love that can only be words coated Whoever went, but its essence is corrupt, cold, a weak man who succumbed to the craziness of lust and when he was satisfied, he fled .. Then he began to lament himself and blame the love of his life, how she proceeded to marry someone else .. He started sobbing as a bereaved widow, but she who killed her husband .. For the woman whom he immersed in the iniquity of desires. Two stars for writer style only
It is not complete .. I am deficient
Hair is not parting thoughts and let down.
disappointing. Close proximity to services, restaurant and metro. The inconvenience at the outside entrance and the traffic jam near the hotel
A little from here on a little from there a minute of absurdity and wasting time spent watching a movie, I tried to understand in them one meaning to present such work, and in this way but all my attempts were unsuccessful, even I was lost with a large amount of dramatic lines from which the author of the work Beth Raymere is the main story thread, so for me, for example, a romantic story line mixed with some social drama, and some comic on some melodrama and struggles in gambling and wagering. , I felt after watching The film, I want to write a script for the film I am also, and I felt that the need is easy, and I can terrify viewers for three of them, a few words and salvation, and I kept presenting a possible work on which a movie can be said, and I don&#39;t mind if I put it out too ... all the feeling came to me and I did not watch the film, which There was a strange feeling left over me while I watched Bruce Wells’s performance in the movie ZD, and the first question he asked himself was that he would have what happened to us like that or not? It means that the actor remains on the floor of any act in which he appears because of Metsenche, or that the money and the case remain not and must be with him, so he must accept any need and peace? In the midst of unnecessary events, and scenes that were deleted and all were canceled, you will not expect the film, in the end, you will be able to see it and evaluate it as boiling eggs at most, and if it was the time spent by the director in making the film, you discover that he wrote and imagined in two days, the film does not deserve more than /
Plain and very humble. The hotel is good and clean. The hotel is very modest compared to the rest of the hotels and it is not worth the amount paid, as it is only suitable for one or two days of residence, provided that it is a business trip and is not suitable for recreational purposes
An empty, narrated, angular novel ... in a unique room full of traces of betrayal, stupidity, and ridiculous trivial stories. I was sad for my minutes, and I gave hope to find something new and urgent that might happen until I reached a last page ... If there was a sub-zero evaluation I would give it to him, but the star of the beauty of the language without regard to the content of the story ... It has become a treasure to find a meaningful novel in the crowd of empty novels
The story is banal and sub-standard for those at the level of Dr. Nabil. Show her a story for a novice writer
disappointing. Location only. The services were not satisfactory
I do not recommend reading it.
Dream language is always frequent, I loved the novel because it was gifted only by a friend
The book is very ordinary. One of the most needs that I see is that the book may be better than others. It is the interventions of visions to tell future events in the story. It was satisfactory to the needs that did not have an explanation. How did Lieutenant Colonel Essam know that Youssef killed Dr. Laila Bass, even though the bodies were all together. I also understood from the events of the story that something does not occupy anyone’s body without summonsing rituals, so how can it be explained that Dr. Lily’s death after her death to report the accident? Sameh&#39;s vague death method. How Sawsan possessed the possibility of killing in this way. The key that tried to enter into the events of this story without explanation is from where, nor what role in the story. As for the end, it is totally illogical
As a beautiful novel, and the style is good in it, a struggle is taking place within most of us of all ages. But the problem is that the writer used real names of people and also some events, and of course he added a style to them because of the element of suspense and excitement in the novel. On Libra it is a novel
As I mentioned the ability to maintain the level of service is necessary and sensitive in service establishments such as hospitals, restaurants, this place is abnormally maintained at the level of service .. in Jeddah, Riyadh, Al-Ahsa Thursday They obey me and come up with .. And in general, no one can occupy me with the job of Abu Yaman as well. Unfortunately, the cleanliness is the last thing they think about. This is if they think about the original ..
At first glance, you feel about to read a serious philosophical work that discusses the cause of death, and with the passage of the pages of the novel you realize the writer&#39;s failure annoyingly in this. As if the writer had opened many horizons and questions that he could not answer, so he resorted to unjustified metaphysical maneuvers and without any preparation to answer all the questions of the huge novel in a few lines directly and blatantly .. From the beginning you find the timeline in the novel scattered, and with time you do not realize any wisdom in this To wonder about the idea of technology .. Did you serve the job that time hash? I think it hurt him too. The second point in his perspective on monasticism and its excessive reduction in its narrow horizon in the presentation of the monks are all fleeing characters from life and from women and pleasure to deserts and the anti-Lord, which confirms the narrow perspective of the writer. Is it possible to classify the stature as when the poor, for example, from these fugitives, who the writer insisted that this is the only model of monasticism? The last scenes, when Christ fell and participated mysteriously in the killing of these monks, then the appearance of comforter in the form of a lover answering the hero&#39;s existential questions in a few lines confirms to you that the writer could not answer these existential questions about death, especially after reducing all the scenes and feelings of love in sexual scenes Just as if this is the only sign of life ... the metaphysics at the end of the novel with those absurd scenes of Christ and the Comforter was a tragedy ending your reading of that novel
Thin words and nice book
Bad and I will not repeat it. The reception is nice. The place is very dirty and very old and very old and bad furniture and I will not repeat the experience again and it is not worth the amount
I had to pay another day for the conditions of my dear brother. Khaled Al-Harbi There is a quick and sure response. Peace be upon you. I booked a non-refundable paid room. In an honest country, I found Abdulaziz Al-Harbi, the mother of the country, discarded of his morals, and I gave up for a family, and among them, they do not compare me to it.
Disappointed We were very disappointed that although we had already paid the reservation price by card, they at the reception desk booked a sum of the card as a guarantee and it has not been released yet a week later.
I don&#39;t know why Ahmed Khaled Tawfik insists on publishing this type of book. The story here is not that these books bore bad ideas, but it is never true that most of his literary publications are compiled essays or ideas that God did not want to complete. This of course adds to his frequently repeated expressions and makes you able to deduce that the author of this passage is Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq, without a doubt.
I know that what I will write now may not be interested in the author of the novel nor his fans who love the novel and the film, but I write about my thoughts, ideas and questions during my reading of the novel, and that is one of the few times unfortunately that I write a review on a book whether I like it or not .. the first thing that occurred To me it was a question about the writer himself, what did Muhammad Sadiq read in order to write this novel? And what is now reading? And what will he read next? That question stems from my firm belief that a good writer is also a good reader. Many writers have spoken a lot about this, and they have important and inspiring articles. But the deepest and most important of them was Borges when he said simply: I do not like to sit with a book writer more than he read .. Perhaps this is a matter of good reason. If the quality of the books he read improves, then his writing improves. Or at least the books gave him new ideas, or maybe he improved his style, performance, wording and language. Many novelists around the world wrote about things that killed writing, but their formulation, and the angle they saw the story made them offer excellent books .. Anyone has the right to write whatever he wants, that freedom that allows everyone to do whatever they want. In the end, this is in our interest as readers. The presence of all shades and colors fills us with joy and happiness. But insisting on celebrating one type of literature, songs, and films reveals how bad the taste has reached .. In the same sense, you have the right to write a script, but do not write on the cover that it is a narrator, as happened here. The novel is written as if it is a movie script, but even this scenario has many shortcomings .. As for the title, there was no embarrassment and the title is just a simple problematic issue regarding what fills the novel from mistakes. The writer said that Hebta means number seven in the Greek language. First there is no longer what is called the Greek language, it means the Greek language. Secondly, the number is pronounced Epta in a thousand, not a distraction. Third, after reading the novel, I wonder about the relationship of the title to the content. The title of the novel is just like this. The reader must discover that it is seven stages of love. What is the relationship of Greek love and its stages? Why the Greek language in particular? I do not know. But the only answer is to preserve the requirements of marketing and advertising. An attractive and strange title must be chosen .. In the end, I say that these famous bad books have a terrible negative effect on the talented writers as a real talent. It makes them feel that everything that they write, read and do has no value in all of this. Perhaps they stopped writing because of despair. That is why I say to all talented novelists, who have not yet had the opportunity to appear and spread, that you do not underestimate and not be sad. I know that when you watch what is going on, you may get frustrated. Low-value books with valuable content are at the forefront, people read them and many talk about them and eventually turn into movies. I tell you, dear, I hope this will not make you sad. I hope you won&#39;t stop writing just because you can&#39;t keep up with the prevailing general climate that encourages bad and bad. I tell you that people&#39;s tastes change, as everything changes. This general climate will change for the better after a while, it is only a matter of time .. You should know that in the nearly forties there was a novelist named Ismail Wali Al-Din filling the world and working people, and his novels turned into movies. Naguib Mahfouz did not know then a few. Now what is left of Ismail Wali Al-Din? Several bad commercial movies? And where did he write? Is anyone reading to him now? Please, talented and talented, don&#39;t stop writing. Just write
The most thing I liked and drew my attention to the book is what Sarah Darwish mentioned at the end of it as being married for a year all the time. God willing, I wish this would be a reality for many homes after the passport, and I liked her intelligence in dealing with her mother-in-law who first hated her because she was not of her choice, but her son’s choice and beautifully the couple’s attempt to make each other happy in various ways without sensitivities and the words of people and others if they were not telling About her life, I thought she was writing about a fantasy that does not exist
Compared to the competing restaurants located in Tabuk, it offers great and delicious lasagna and the pizza has delicious, but here are other items that are not good. The important thing is the horse lasagna.
Unfortunately, less than expected. The location is suitable in the first stems. The room is very narrow and the room smells bad and the worst is the smell of the sleeping bed where I could not sleep the positions crowded
I decided to read the book for one reason, Muhannad Abu Dayyah .. And an experiment to learn the writings of the intruder. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed. I hesitated to put it in books that were not recommended for Muhannad and for all those with his bones Muhannad .. The book did not contain the new information. All Muhannad’s information had already passed on me, which is the door The second part of the book, the first chapter was talking about his experience in the restaurant of darkness and it was a beautiful experience but it lacks a lot of details, but the last section I passed on to him the honorable passage, because it is only quotes .. I think I bought a book for an outsider to read a pen, no poetry quotes, and personal interviews. A star for Muhannad, each one of them Muhannad and still confirming themselves blindly They could not healthy to do it.
This novel has a story when I bought it. It is not important to tell the story of its purchase as much as it is important for me to mention to you my reading of this book ... a very daring novel as far as obscenity ... , I missed the literature and did not find it here .. hmmm very surprised that it won the poker prize ... hmmm what I liked most about the novel at the time of buying it Haha was honeymoon with the one I love:. I give it one star because the book has value to me as I mentioned, and this will remain my personal opinion with my great respect to the person of the highly respected writer
A group of articles gathered in a book, but if I wrote in Elvis or his blog, it would be better because I do not see anything that calls him to write. This is his book because I do not treat a problem or even put it numb by reducing our aches. But it is a scattered ideas of the writer wrote in the form of a book. Even the title, as if it does not refer to anything in a book, but rather a kind of promotion. But my first star for the cover design. My second star for the drawings, Islam Gawish, relieved some of my harassment from a writer. And it took place, thank God
One of the worst books I have ever read in my life, I regret wasting my time reading the book, which I consider to be a mere stuffing of words and people without any substance to the idea
Somewhat similar to an alchemist. Or perhaps it is an explicit restoration of the alchemist, but with different characters. I did not like the novel, which was long without a goal
I did not find it enjoyable. I read it to kill boredom during the free time between classes.
Bad . nothing. The inconvenience of the adjacent room and the narrow apartment is a visit that will not be repeated
Enough on it, the star has ... Where is the coffee and the uranium? This is not even an article by this name
disappointing. nothing. Everything
Maybe she deserved three stars but she didn&#39;t like it
The novel is very ordinary
A story whose language is simple but it contains aspects that I disagree with with the book and the large number of redundancies in places that do not make sense of redundancy ,,, my story ended with the story and the end was happy for the writer, but it was not so for me as love is born in a good land and grows with clean water and Its sweet fruits grab the look
I will never live in one of the Riwaq group in the future, and I will not advise anyone else to live in it. . The furniture is very old, including the table in the hall, which is broken. The lights do not work, and after communicating with the reception, I was informed that there were no bulbs. The internet is very, very weak. The cupboard door is broken. The hall&#39;s dye walls are stained, prominent and not good. I am surprised to book from the website and find the situation in this situation
As usual, Dr. Ahmed amazes me with his ability to transform the ordinary situations that we go through without raising our attention to stories and tales .. Rather, he often says the most complex things about the simplest things and this in itself is creativity. This book came in a lower level than his other books, but in the style of Dr. Ahmed Al-Sakhir with distinction as usual
I did not know the true purpose of the novel, it was unfortunately revolving around one axis from the beginning to the end and the reader of the novel knows what I&#39;m talking about. The details of the novel are so rational and logic that it is difficult for the recipient to accept it, given that we are a nation that believes in the jinn, their existence and their capabilities. With our knowledge and belief in the existence of the jinn, however, his narration of the ability of Qandish to scientific research and so on makes me feel as if the writer desires me and despises my mentality. In addition, the fairy Aisha fights demons and protects believers from mankind and jinn. The first novel of d. Ghazi Algosaibi, and I think it will be the last.
I can say that I read the entire novel and did not find what I wanted. Because I erred in the name of the novel. As I searched for a flowering life and did not find what I wanted. As for the novel, it is about putting faith into practice. There are many stories that I read in the novel that are told as anecdotes or legacies. Like the story of the monk with the column ... I never loved her
The novel is a propaganda of the highest order and not of great moral value. How to deal with the story is like a good struggle for Mahfouz and is often closer to Azazel&#39;s account of Zidane ... The narration is unsuccessful and the novel is somewhat disjointed, especially the story of Carter and dealt with in the novel. Many historical events are mistaken. End: Ahmad Murad abandoned the element of suspense and crime with his novels, losing many of his language faculties
I will not repeat the experience at this hotel. The reception is beautiful and the location is special only I did not like it at all, and I will not repeat the visit. The air conditioning was very bad. I contacted and fixed it, but there was no benefit. The bed was very uncomfortable. The room is very small.
I could not read it
I have never seen such a book in my life. First: The memoirs of this writer during his childhood are all lost and lost, and all that is narrated about him is his life in the streets, escape from schools, smoking and thefts, as if he has no father who raises, nor does a mother refine. Second: The writer’s words are very very vulgar and very far-fetched, this is not his ugly analogies ... These notes are of no use as a role model for conscious Muslim youth, despite the presence of some sense of humor and humor in it ... In short, reading this book is a waste of time only without coming up with benefits ..
disappointing. Location. Bad hygiene
Because I am not one of the women who have sex with any man. And because you are a man who will not be repeated in the history of my femininity. Because I loved you, you will not sign the female honor code, nor will I forget you, and I will sip your love and abandon you until the last breath .......
disappointing. Its location has beauty touches, I expected it to be better than such. Hear the movement of the elevators while you are in the rooms near them, as well as the toilets, may God bless you. You must put down the toilet cover so that you can reach the pressurized compressor and the cleanliness of the fork and spoon in the restaurant not washed well.
A very short story collection for the beloved writer Barahi Aslan. Medium level. The most prominent stories are the last drowning. /
After finishing reading the novel, I came up with something which is very intuitive and I do not know why it took me so long to digest it. It is that the fact that the novel is on the bestseller shelf means that it is one of the best sellers .. only for nothing .. does not mean anything else:
I don’t know if this book deserves all the media hype, recurring topics and a collection of articles I have not finished reading .. I did not like it, perhaps because this type of article does not fit my taste.
disappointing. . The staff is bad, as if they were usurped to work, late services and reception, and not answering the phone to the point that I have to go out and speak with the employee myselfLighting is very poor lighting in the roomVery exaggerated price
An unhappy experience and I will not repeat it again. The location is excellent.The lobby is a lovely atmosphere, only only. Despite my travel experience, I was surprised by the level of hotel services and the way the staff handled my calls and requests, which were normal. This is what called me to leave a full day before the scheduled date, however the reception staff did not ask me about my departure, but their concern was that the money will not be returned, and when I asked to meet the manager, I was told that he was in a meeting. The Wi-Fi is very unhappy and very weak, In order to pay you to subscribe to paid packages it is sad that Wi-Fi is in exchange for that Wi-Fi has become an easy issue, a bad experience I will not repeat, and I do not recommend visiting the hotel
I was not impressed at this novel at all ... because of what he said in it words that do not belong to modesty. I expected better than this for Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq
As for me, it was not the level I expected .. I did not like the military comparisons in the book, so the difference between the rich and the rich ... I intended to read the genius of Omar as well, but it seems that I will reconsider
It is a study on the Court of Tents, and a translation of his poetry on Persian. The researchers differ on the number of quartets, which one is attributed to tents, and which ones are more. I did not enjoy poetry as I expected, and I felt that translating poetry erased its charm and splendor
Traditional story. Not surprised. Her end injured me in the death of:. The language can be good. But if the story supported it a little
Weak. . The room is small
The hotel is very bad. There is nothing to praise compared to the prestigious Dubai hotels. The hotel arrived, it was very poor reception, and I was told to withdraw a Dirham of insurance, then a Dirham was withdrawn. The hotel does not receive visitors, knowing that I have rented to another hotel, and I was welcomed and visited by visitors. After a few days, visitors entered and in front of me, I do not know the reason, as long as there are security measures followed by all hotels. Hygiene workers rudely and improperly open the door and enter while I was sleeping and then exit with a sign that does not disturb. All hotel facilities are boring and considered for sleeping only. Dealing with very bad employees. I was ordering a room with a view of the beach or the upper floors. They were told I had a trip and made a waking up timing. Unfortunately, there was no response. The area is very far away from entertainment, desired malls, disturbing cars, road works, entry and exit very busy. I lived in many hotels in Dubai, the worst double Tree Hilton, and I wish everyone the attention and not to go down at all. Finally, the prices differ from the booking website, in addition to the fact that I have proof of the accounts, but unfortunately, to no avail. In addition, an incorrect invoice was calculated and payment was made in exchange for leaving the bad place without return.
The first novel or book in my life is to cut it as long as my hands on the ground. I deserve compensation for the damage caused by the book to an intelligent level
The worst Four Seasons hotel on the planet is a beautiful building and rooms, but the service is very poor from untrained staff. Obviously, the place needs a new general manager the staff are friendly but have no idea the basics. I forgot the closing date on the first night. There is no substitution for the contents of the mini-fridge, ice or coffee. Insufficient staff at the check-out desk and there are also not enough cars for the hotel, and there are often long lines to wait for taxis. The main restaurant is only buffet style and not a la carte system. I argued with the bartenders at the bar that they closed fifteen minutes before the appointment. Quite annoying place. I will never go back.
I never imagined that her ending would be so bad. . The second star is because I just enjoyed reading it
A light and delicious snack for those suffering from symptoms of depression ... A group of entries for a naughty but romantic girl ... A soft style with a spontaneous childish flavor ... Simple and close to the heart ... But despite all of the above I find the book normal .. It takes more space Of its size and an unworthy amount of fame.
Squeezed a kilogram of money to complete it ..... Unfortunately, Muhash&#39;s novel is necessary
What does it mean to be alone ,,, the book can be considered as a separator, if you are drowning then ideology, you can read this set of texts as a comfort, if you are depressed, your condition will get worse .. the book is dark, and it is basically a group of sayings about love, friends and departure And treachery .... a few leaves and a terrible dose of pain ..
Very weak. We could not sit down due to poor service and one of the workers brazenly raised his voice. Bad handling is not worth a star
disappointing. The workers&#39; screen. Lack of family parking and old bedding when booking, credit card is debited and upon departure you are asked to pay in cash and wait for the period until the amount is returned to the credit card
The book is good, but I am not interested in it, it is primarily important to the Salafi Islamists. My note to him is that he provides a number of evidence, incidents and statistics without referring them to references. It also seems to me that the topic needs a lengthy and in-depth scientific / legal research to establish this approach
Thoughts filled with sorrow .. which raised my attention that the title of the risk was often attracting me, but its content does not do the same to me .. I stopped this phrase to remind me of a memory that I always try to forget: ..In life there are things that do not wait, you may miss a train and take the next train. ..The next may be better but it remains in the end your second choice. Even if you realize that the first is better, you will never realize it, no matter what you do. In short, they are short thoughts that are suitable for a low dose .. They will not take more than a quarter of an hour ... If only the thoughts were more than this or longer .. Good luck:
Perhaps I have not read with the eyes of the heart, and I turn the pages of the novel .. Or I simply say that I am not the one who is tainted by the two titles and enchanted by the word of love itself without touching the effect, so perhaps I did not make a good choice..and I did not convince me of that relationship that linked between the Rumi and the sun, but I did not understand what the significance From them..I saw in Ella&#39;s sacrifice to meet Aziz, a true embodiment of the meaning of love, with some reservations..I was not amazed by many lines, but the most recent summed up the essence in my view: The universe becomes different when fire loves water.
Despite the smoothness of Atheer style ... her creativity in arranging sentences ... I read half of the book compelled ... I hated Jumana&#39;s weakness ... and Aziz&#39;s name. And between repetition and repetition. The narration and lengthening that killed the idea. I decided to stop .. with regret
Bad and I would not recommend it to families. . Air conditioning is very poor, staff is bad at handling
The novel I did not like about the events inside it in some of them, and some of the needs that are not logical at all, and the needs are not relevant. Good story, but in Nessbali, I did not like it very much
I have an eager soul, and I have achieved nothing but yearn for something higher. Omar Bin Abdulaziz
Empty story
Pessimistic
The rubber shell fell after its first use of poor quality
I liked Naji Al Ali&#39;s drawings ... and she followed a sweet poem
The worst thing I&#39;ve read
Poor level. . The standard in general is poor, not deserving of stars, the hotel in general needs to be refurbished
In those days I hoped to find a book the size of its title. I fully realize, after reading, that the book is about praise and praise, and it is a praise that deserves more than that of the Messenger of Guidance, may God bless him and grant him peace. But its title attracted me to buy it and to know something from the conclusions from his biography, but I am sorry that I did not find myself and if I admit that I have benefited from several axes, they added something to me. Thank you Dr. Aid
My admiration for the book boils down to the sellers.
Bad stay. . The stay was poor due to the poor level of hygiene ... whether in the lobby or in the room there were smells and dust and the floors are dirty. I found hair remains in it as well as very rickety .... I will not repeat this hotel
The location is uncomfortable and the services are unsatisfactory and there is no transportation. The treatment of the employees of the reception was lost and uncivilized. They did not treat the customer kindly and politely
disappointing. Cleanliness. The place is very far from everything ... the rooms are very, very narrow, and I will not repeat the experience.
The attention of I live from a year and every year in a continuous development. It is noticed now that it is the worst hotel that I descended from the date of / / until / / many problems with inmates. Security interferes in everything. No visitor can be comfortable with the inmate. The minibar, frankly, security is not trained to work in the hotel, they interfere in everything, visitors cannot be comfortable with problems with the police police without justifications. The security official is sleeping all the time. Frankly, there is no psychological comfort in this hotel. Security is safe. Security is safe. It is a hotel for the convenience of the tourist, not a prison for him
It is not only the mother in the story who says oh .. but all writers will gather in a public square and say, oh and our brothers, if only we had not taken literature as a way .. we have reached the bottom. Al-Jahiz If he had read this nonsense, he would have had his nose sharpened, as his eyes had pounded. The calamity is the meeting of Review, he says, I like philosophy in the stories. Philosophy, who is the sea of science, the conceptual canal? That&#39;s enough
Very bad . View of the Kaaba near the campus. The reception staff must be changed, and on top of them the alternate manager quarrels with the inmates and does not have the ethics of high-end dealing with customers ,, there are no parking spaces ,, waiting hours in the reception up to hours on the pretext of a random and barbaric lack of staff in the reception not worthy of a star hotel
Disaster . Wi-Fi. Everything. The sofa sticks to you when you sit on it. There is a lot of dirt on it. The kitchen is very dirty and I could not enter it at all.
Not satisfied with the place for the amount paid. . I expected it to be a hotel but it came out hotel apartments
I read this book challenging books on a book category for a writer who did not like and had not read it before. What I see is illogical, how do I not like him and I have not read it before. In the end, I decided to read to a writer who writes in a field that I do not like, and I chose Hassan Al-Jundi and a group of funny and sarcastic stories since I do not prefer to read the type of horror he writes. The writer is really sarcastic. He laughed already. The writer takes us to Farghaly’s world, the university student who finds, as the proverb says, in every desolation of a puck. It is short and can be read in one sitting, and read electronically
The theme simply did not satisfy me, but I tried to read Laban Jaloun and I think that this novel does not reflect his creativity
I did not like it much, did not prefer it, and did not agree with my personal taste .. its language is heavier than what I prefer in romance, and I do not prefer the Bedouin environment in the first place.
Excellent location but not up to five stars. Location price. Hygiene The toilets do not have strong water pressure, especially for bidets, windows are not sealed
C is a very special annoyance because of the discos at the end of the night. Not suitable for families. The crowd at the hotel is special at night
What is inside my mix and I would advise .... . I booked through Pukin with a Visa service and carried out the withdrawal process twice from the reservation and this is the process of embezzlement of funds. Visa process
I think I read it at an inappropriate time .. I didn’t understand much .. I might read it again later
Shopping . The place is quiet, away from noise and crowd. The reception session is more accurate in order to receive the room. The service is very tired. The furniture is very old
My review is little for a book, not because it is not a good book, but for me it was less than my expectations ... the information in it most of it is not new, at least for me. My impressions of the book: The book is good for anyone who wants to understand the subconscious and its paranormal .. The author is a chapter and I dwell on the explanation, but I have a strong reservation on the writer’s language sometimes some sentences I could not read some ideas also I do not believe in them, I found myself doing some filtering of ideas, thank God I did not I have to do this a lot ... Did the book redeem me? Yes, but not for the purpose assigned to him, I like the idea of opening up to the other opinion ... trying to understand things from different angles ... maybe this is something that benefited me the most from him
Yogurt milk
Quite an ordinary hotel. The rooms are spacious and the colors are beautiful. The workers responsible for bringing an excellent and fast car come with a beautiful view. The internet is bad and the room smells foul from smokers and disturbs the presence of a disco directly below
Very weak. . The amount is deducted without hotel accommodation
The similes and pictures are beautiful, but the stories are boring and broken. I wish it was one long story.
Work for laughter only:
Very weak. . Its location in GPS is incorrect. Rest in the corridors. The bathrooms are unclean and the water in them is very poor
The events themselves are strange, moving, and another world is the world of kings, palaces and good neighbors. But the philosophy that fills the book and the boring historical narration of the wars of the second Saudi state made me hope for it and go beyond many lines
There is nothing wrong . . View website
A nice novel that tells the story of a person in the madhouse. It has a lot of fun and culture in a very big way. Fun and in the end, Dr. Ghazi&#39;s idea should be inserted:
A rubbish old hotel. . The air conditioning is very old and troubled. There are restaurants in the hotel. There is an annoying wedding hall. The furniture is old from the nineties.
I have many problems with him, because he is utopian and unrealistic. He envisions a society whose Muslims will be sound and faith based on this absolute and impossible ..
Abu Nasser . The reception staff are poor and the location is worse and the value is greatly overrated.
Small matters. You pass by without turning. Equal I have my life. All my life. Accidents .. may not interest you. The oldest ones are palaces. And live on it for months
A novel that is suitable for nothing, except for quoting some sentences from it, to be used later in decorating the personal pages of teenage girls on social media .. One of the worst things I read, in fact, this novel is the worst that I read to this day, compared to its wide fame and the enormity of the writer&#39;s name .. A page of fresh, pure nonsense scented with all sorts of exquisite improvements and words heavy on the ear, weak meaning, this is from the literary point of view. As for the story, it revolves around a hopeless love adventure for an Algerian singer immersed with a Lebanese businessman, not for anything other than that he saw these The last in a talk show, which pushed him to Matt Aura wanted across different capitals of the world using bouquets of dark flowers, hoping that it would distinguish it from other people, as the hero of the story somehow succeeds in appearing at the entrance of every hotel where the hero is staying, and the strange thing is that the love birds in the novel do not discuss topics that It is discussed by the general public, from political, social and other issues, that they content themselves with philosophy about love, feelings and other topics that capture the hearts of adolescents .. As for the characters of the novel, we have Hala Al-Wafi, an Algerian singer, who worked as a primary school in the past, before she turned To sing after the assassination of her father and brother by extremists Islamists in the nineties in Algeria, as for the hero of the story, Mr. Talal Hisham, a Lebanese businessman, married with two daughters, a character who buys hearts and everything with money, sometimes it seems to you that the story revolves around the richest man in the world, a narcissistic narcissist figure .. the story is in the caution Itself is trivial, not interesting, devoid of plot, and its events are very expected ... the only star of the writer&#39;s success in describing the social situation in Algeria during the years of embarrassment.
disappointing. . There is no private parking, not clean
disappointing. . There is inconvenience due to the night club
Although there were people who advised me, my readers, but I decided to go through the experience, it is boring, and the translation was poor and the glory was in favor of the laity. May I re-read it
A bit acceptable, but I will never live in it. Morning breakfast. My room situation was not my choice at the time of booking
Very few articles are good. The style in most articles is completely wasted and boring. And I will not forget the article that was sold pages and the introduction on its own pages and text by what was feared in the subject of the article for sure I would not think of the article but I thought that I was a book hierarchy of boredom
Bad stay. . The bed is not comfortable and the guests enter your privacy
Very weak. . I asked that there be four beds in each room, and I only found two beds. The rooms are not ready with the reservation and we did not add it, and some were not
Nice novel. But not
A research into the causes of the fall and fall that afflicted the Arab world and trying to provide solutions that serve the transformation, regardless of the evaluation, however, any proposal regarding this issue is very important at the present time.
disappointing. Cleanliness. Aircondition cool only, no clothes relation, bathroom shoes are very bad
disappointing. The hotel is very bad, odorless cooking smells. The water cycle escapes Moi and contains insects
Very bad . Their breakfast is good .... Frankly, a hotel that is not fit in the name of Mövenpick. Upon arrival, I did not find anyone to drop the bags ... I took it myself ... There is an unpleasant smell at the corridor of the rooms..but the worst is preventing children from going to the pool. ???? An experience that I will never repeat
I came back with my review ...:. I am always wary of many books that meet a great boom and echo, and this is based on many books I read because of the uproar around them, then I discover that they do not deserve all of this in my view. We say this is my personal opinion. But I allow myself to give the opportunity to such books as perhaps they deserve all of this and more, and some books have proven this as well ... But I have noticed that the majority of these books harvest this noise from the general readership because they touch something inside a person, touch his feelings or suffering and start to manipulate the feeling On the surface, one of us would like it, but if many of them were subjected to a fair evaluation, why would these works not be huge? This book I see is a book closer to the commercial, which tickles the religious senses of others and presents a utopian image of a person’s relationship with his Lord, and completely ignores a person’s relationship with his community .. I can say With a mouthful of narration that narrates the horizon narrow, and the judgments that it claims Miqa, it is essentially superficial and contradictory ... The writer drops the story of the miserable wife Ella who lost much of her soul after a exhausted life of caring for a husband and caring for the children and then met her dear when she decided to search for work on the love story that Rumi and Tabrizi fought in her words ... the narration The novelist and the syntax are excellent, the style is smooth and enjoyable, and very fit when you lose fitness in reading. Hold this book until it paves you back to reading again ... I am not skilled in literary criticism, but I will write my abstract opinion:. The work is not that strong enough to fuss this noise .. It frankly misses a lot .. A very consuming and boring idea .. It does not arouse any enthusiasm for me .. The only good thing is to link the past to the present and this leads us to criticize the historical aspect that I see very weak in this novel. There is no strong historical history or observation of that period, the novelist could leapfrog the novel to higher levels by supporting the historical side in greater depth than the surface in which it was taken up ... And whoever recites Azazel and the Granada trilogy or the narrator of Cordoba will fully realize the weakness of his historical side ... One of the advantages of fictional work for me is that no one conquers his idea, unlike books Intellectual or objective .. dialogues and you can choose what suits you and each in his opinion right and wrong, but this novel felt that the victory of the idea of mysticism is very present .. it always highlights that the last word of the sun and his thoughts. The ideas of others are presented in a way that appears wrong and superficial. There is a lot of exaggeration in that ... So I say that the horizon of the novel is very narrow .. and contradictory .. People are two classes: a hard-liner who loves pleasure or worship governs by appearance ... Tabrezi&#39;s category: love and love and outside is excluded even if you drink wine ... a childish and naive idea, not From Sufism in something .. It promotes that Islam is just that way, as depicted by Shams who is in the novel, and besides that they are ignorant and lost much of Islam .. This is a kind of madness and contradiction and I only show you what I see ... It is not reasonable to ask others That they do not make judgments regarding our actions and that this is only between us and God, but man is present in a society and his actions most of which affect this community A Pei or willing .. The Quran came with individual, community, political, military, and family organizations. You cannot separate yourself from society. Then you say, I will drink a glass of wine and I will practice sweet disbelief and then promote it as the ideal Islam. Yes, I strongly believe that there are behaviors that we have nothing to do with it, as it is between the servant and his Lord, as long as it does not affect society or my freedom as an individual ... Rather, Sufism presents its most naive form ... The truth is that after reading it for a long time, I slowly began to hate: What does this narration want? What do I need to deliver? None of what was mentioned in the introduction to the book did not convince me that there is none of that which profoundly communicated or presented .. no love, no love, no worship ... unjustified reverence for the relationship of Shams and Rumi is strange? There is contempt for the rest of humanity in an indirect and perhaps unintended way .. The sun and those like it are the mystics in this narration who were able to reach very high levels of spirituality that would not be understood by the simple people who look to Islam without what is seen by those who dance and rotate and then their souls are united at levels Etc. etc. Then there are many nodal fallacies that I cannot yet pass safely ... What does it mean if the adopted child in Rumi House watches you see dead souls and talks to them as if they have. On other worlds ... Then there are a good number of transgressions that have no origin but flaws ... As for the forty rules of love itself, the rule of rule is not new or an invention from the writer, but I can say that the writer failed to include the rules in the template of the novel .. The topic turned into a lecture and indoctrination .. as if they were numbered paragraphs to be included .. In the sentences, the inclusion of the rules was very, very weak and not appropriate for the fictional work. Therefore, I say work is a novelist that is not good at all and does not deserve that commotion, but it caresses our feelings through religious thoughts that contain many fallacies so that we assume that we really agree with everything and that we are tired of the intervention of others and their narrow view of our relationship with our Lord while we are part of all the characters in the novel ... ... we judge, narrow and expand worship, how we want and then read a book that simulates emotion only so we tend to it and believe that we are always the victim ... the book is a weak summary of those who will read it with a mind and heart, and will discover from the first quarter the shallowness of the historical and eclectic aspect in it. I do not advise you to read it without reading Sufism from several references and without reading about Al-Roumi and the history of that period ... In the end, in the book are good things that we take and return the rest ..
I do not support housing in Ramada. nothing. The rooms are not clean when moving the beds, dirt appeared to us under us to not meet the needs of the guests, and the hotel phone does not want the internet to be blocked when we asked the restaurant
Bad . . Very bad smell, we are young and given a double bed, knowing that I have a barrier for two single beds and they said that the hotel does not have a single bed
The guests of Rahman are all kind and respectful. The room is spacious and Kaaba view is an excellent experience. I was standing in line at one of the reception staff when logging in. He left me and went to another customer, so I told him that you do not have the right to cross me and go to a customer who told me the employee. Go to another receptionist because I will not serve you. Room number The water overflows over the tiles because the ceramic is higher than the water drainage hole
I found the book very ordinary. Perhaps because I read it forty years after it was first published
I do not recommend it, as it is not used to in the past. . Upon check-in, the treatment of the receptionist was not acceptable. When we entered the room upon arrival, it was found that there were open and used cans of orange juice and water in the refrigerator in the room.
The hotel services did not rise to a star, we were deceived by staying with him. . Malpractice of the staff. We did not deliver the kettle
It is forbidden to win a poker. I almost doubt the reliability of this award
Eighteen stories, including what I have read more than once. Show me God. martyr. And it was the world. The killer admitted. The birth of an idea. Face the truth. The rest was a fleeting reading, sometimes bored
The victim&#39;s policy is the basic thima in the novel .. and this is what I see as the worst and sometimes unjustified way more
Because I stay in it again. The internet is excellent and free of charge. The beds are clean, tired, dirty, and the towels are dirty and the water is a musty smell, and there are no bathroom slippers.
In the beginning, I was excited to read this novel, and the title attracted me the most, although I did not know its meaning except when I got to the middle of the novel and the cover. Wonderful, and it will satisfy the reader, but upon reaching the part related to a forgotten attempt to kill Reem, the topic becomes disappointing, since from the beginning, a quiet girl isolated and shrinking on her gloomy dark world feared people and their looks and did not dare to confront them, so how and where did the force come to try to kill Reem and Hatred and anger fills her, and she knows for sure that c A secret that will not accept to love her because of her weakness, and she is still taking her first steps to leave the age of childhood ... The end disappointed me a lot, why did Jasser be killed and he learned that a forgotten infected with necrophilia and that she might kill someone to enjoy his body especially and had noticed her cunning looks and He knew that she loved him, why did he not think that she had returned to revenge, could not believe in her and trust her return even if his sense of guilt for what he had done with her, yes, he was arrogant and exploiting her condition and weakness and a cause of her loss but he does not deserve this shameful end And the agonizing ... the most compelling feeling for me when I read Lancrovia was disgust and disgust
I hope to read it again with a better translation,
In this issue, Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq did not deny or prove the myth, stating only the facts associated with it and evidence of its existence, as well as evidence of its invalidity, then left the reader with the freedom to choose. For me, this number did not add new, if not strong, as usual. But as usual, I like the writer&#39;s notes and some of his sarcastic hints that force my yellow smile to visit my lips
It was if it was less than a star I would put it. I mean, the first experience of the writer, and we said, okay .. But you regret, I still have no time for you to write novels, which is supposed to do any literary work that he performs in order to provide it to himself and people, but a novel in this vulgar form. Every line that he read on it remains expected after him, so it is totally sub-standard: /
I know that Naguib Mahfouz&#39;s novels are strong and mimic society in particular, but when I read a novel under love in the rain, I was surprised; the novel did not like me very much; it was boring with its events, and her characters are also many. He talks about love, so events were unclear and disjointed, there is no correlation in the novel, despite the complexity of events, but the plot was not coherent, until the end was not clear.
Beyond to the extreme:. It is not known in principle, written on the novel, that it is forbidden to sell to men. I am her village as a curiosity and a sense that it is written like this with a commercial purpose, and I am not more It is not fair that anyone reads it to the most biased girls, because she does not know the reality of his frustration in her personal life and expresses it, nor from the stories that she was using from her fans, or as a problem solver, and so ?? The girls are nearing, and there is no fault in them. There is no mistake in them. The reason for any problem is that all men must be treacherous, and Betnasso, the old love with a new one, and always Pedoro for physical gratification. A second point is that even the problems that I dealt with in the book show a simple part. Suddenly, I find myself transformed and without any introductions that the cause of the problem is the male, then she gives advice to girls and how they deal with men in this situation. Unsuccessful novel, this time I feel a sense that I want to cut it and throw it into the garbage:
. Syrian Maan, but ... I did not like the quality of such students. The only good is that I got to know more about dentistry
Very weak. . Cleanliness is so bad that they cleaned three times, and the blankets looked good and the service was bad.
Before I read the book and the one who prayed from the title, I would read a romantic story that remained and heard a sweet story of two heroes in the novel and the sweet talk that was all .... A hero and not a single narrator. He spoke to one of three countries. I felt annoyed ... but I was not so narrow that I was not complete ... Whoever spoke in a quarter of the book, but almost, and said it to a girl, appeared on the last two pages after a brief description of it in the first chapter clearly, if he wrote the end and rode on it with my details The story ... the end is written with art and a high sense of my sensitivity in it that he was a pager and troubled himself strong from the first novel to arrive at the end that he drew from the first so that the moment comes and writes it ... You may not choose the appropriate address. Noticeable. The book is sweet, read it ..... opinion does not represent anything that tastes I just love reading books with an evaluation view from my point of view, which is certainly not necessary to agree with everyone and there are some notes that do not mean that the book likes you:
The beginning of the novel is very interesting and the diversity of the characters is beautiful, as each character tells her side of the novel by herself, and this reminded me of the Abyss balcony narration for Ibrahim Nasrallah. But this feature turned into a flaw for the many characters, which caused me a lot of distraction. Add to that the abundance of his speech on the political side in Kuwait, which I do not understand, which compelled me to skip those lines in order to return to the essence of the novel, which made me lose so much pleasure. I enjoyed the first third of the novel, got bored in the second third, and got distracted in the last third, telling a story by one of his heroes and then denying it by the same hero to tell another different story for the same incident by the same narrator. The novel is full of unfortunate events and unfortunate people. I do not like this type of narration, because life has a lot of negative energies, so I do not need to read more from it.
I booked and couldn&#39;t find my reservation. Breakfast only ... a nuisance building next to the hotel .. I could not find a specific reservation for me..the rooms are small and small
You are not up to standard. I did not like anything.
I eat human flesh, terrify blood, blood, blood, blood, seconds, but you will get a little fatigued and faint, and I will give you another ... not yet ?. Ok, I have a little jinn and goblins. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat Ok, excuse me, but I wouldn&#39;t go there. A struggle between demons, angels and the awakened saints can affect you, and I will give you permission, but he sings for me a little, because I am tired Oi..Maho you will be terrified, I will be terrified ... .... This is the summary of a page in which I did not find anything interesting to look at other than the writer&#39;s desire to Your notice that horror is the fate of everyone who holds its book .. very multiple gaps in the novel .. quote unusually from what I followed for the season as if I read the series’s script but with a high degree of weakness .. mixing different horror features for stuffing and padding only and amplifying the workload It made me dazzle. Frankly, I used to find one of them, Pavi, to kill vampires and Yigi Drokes from the planet Zultar with his spaceships to occupy the hero&#39;s house. Even acts of terror have some restrictions and conditions and are not commonsensible in such a way. Gumpago Allegernão..Sofako Matin de supposedly a regular intelligence phrase, there is no questioning ads. In the novel, in a language, there are only words, and its translation was nice. I laughed at me: Do you think that your curiosity is fun ?? Or is your escape a departure from the written ??. Suddenly, two questions remained, and all of these words are nice. The translation, in principle, is not understood. I do not recommend reading
Silly and boring articles in which Mostaghanemi tries to be cute by expressing her opinion on the political situation with an undue focus or he may have an excuse on dogs, White House dogs in particular ... its blood is very heavy and political opinions have no opinion, just ridicule and talk about her crying Saddam Hussein has to be executed and many things like that.
How did the Islamic brochures easily turn into ridiculous novels? Literature, writing, or art in general from my point of view are two needs, oh either good or bad, I have a bad need, very bad and God.
Mustafa Mahmoud in his stories is very different from his books. Lea experience again with the short stories of Mustafa Mahmoud after the set of people. Quite amusing, but you do not need anything, unlike his books. Many stories ended suddenly, and I did not know what was the meaning of them. His stories always speak of people of his failure, drunkards, junkies, teachers, fakes and so on. The accent used among the characters is very similar to the old Arabic films. I wouldn&#39;t like this type of literature. Two stars but not for fun, no more
Very weak. Nothing ever. The cleanliness is very, very, very bad. Their treatment is very bad. After I left the hotel, they called me and accused me of stealing the children&#39;s bed. With me, they did not regret and apologize for accusing me
Very weak. . I came on time according to the mentioned date of arrival, and the receptionist told me unfortunately there is no apartment available even though my reservation is confirmed
Unfortunately, the history of Yusef Zidan fell
I thought it was a book full of adventures, wars, conquests, and other tales of Andalusia, so if it had a boring tale of an ambitious young man from Cordoba, he became its ruler thanks to intrigues, conspiracies and cunning, even if this was a historical event, the writer took it very boringly, which did not motivate me to finish the book to know its last. Eh I even left his reading for a while and then returned to him when I did not find jealousy in front of me, but that will not change my opinion on the great writer Abdul Hamid Jouda Al-Sahar and will not prevent me from reading other works for him
disappointing. . The internet is on the upper floor, the reception is C.
What is the one who toured the castle by the sea? My question here is real and it is not ironic. The story was walking in a sweet way in the first part and the story of Rana and her son are captive and strange spiritual forces between them..and in the middle the psychological dramatic line that links Rana&#39;s relationship with her husband Zain to the extent here and things were complete. ..To the fact that the Masonic part was interchanged with no, and it is not Hanker that the writer is influenced by two episodes of the coming series and the spirit of the times, and who became famous through YouTube and who spoke in a steady detail about Masonic plots in the world..However, the author did not come close to the world of Freemasonry. ... I prefer hovering around it, hovering around, exporting the idea of the conspiracy, in everything until de Maneghtash, in communicating the idea with his consent, I do not know why I felt that it was affected by Johnny Depp&#39;s film. Foreign origins to emphasize the idea of the external conspiracy as if Egyptian Masons and even her own personality are not suspicious of the exaggerated doubts so much that you ask yourself why you did not raise people&#39;s doubts, especially the way she treats her and the way she gets to the blood sample from people and nevertheless compels yourself that you complete the story with a way let me cheat you let me Delicacy fooled ... a child of the mysterious figure Ayman who do not know what exactly. Is it an evil spirit or a hanging spirit that came to take revenge on those Freemasons who killed him while trying to take control of his soul and subjugate them to them as I said the story was in its beginning inspired a plot of psychological horror drama unless I finished it and I ask myself where is the story that works as a horror movie as it came p The cover of the end of the book is a good attempt, but it lacks a lot of its expression. In my humble opinion, it stuck to the conspiracy theory and linked the revolution to it, and to whom I saw it. I was in the context of the context and did not like the frankness .... The two stars are only to praise the narration style and describe the feelings of Rana, which the writer glowed in and conveyed to the reader feelings and feelings Rana.
It is not the level of Ahmed Murad
Very weak. . Ironing two shirts and trousers with riyals, and the length of the night the doors go wrong
High value for poor service. The view.
One of the worst hotels. I did not like anything. Everything, especially reception
My feelings were not constant while reading this book. It oscillates between admiration, attention, and finally boredom. In my opinion, Dr. Salman Hasha the book with many unnecessary details. And if it were not for his successive wisdom, I would regret reading.
The translation is not sweet. Details and description of the books. sad ending. Esmeralda .... the symbol of freedom and giving. Quasimodo ... is a symbol for everyone who was wronged because of his form or religion. Dom Claude Frolo ... a worker like Mahmoud El-Melegy in the Egyptian cinema. Evil and everything, but good to his family. And helps the hero to reduce either turn on him. Captain Fopez is not clear about many needs
disappointing. Sweet and new apartments. Service and do not stop the car
I had read it a long time ago and wrote about it: : //. . / ...
A very interesting and interesting novel, characterized by the abundance of characters and the multiplicity of places.
This is your time. I am yours. This is Shaylak. And a Chinese on your head. I am your family, I am a hermit. I condemn you and your holiness. An hour of your poverty..I am your palace. The hour of your war ... I am your bullets. I teach you. I teach you. And despair I have. Far from you, your heart, and all you love. And for all who loves you. Come today, and see what I&#39;m seeing. The shop on the day of tears. And your heart does not hurt you. It does not come that steal you on the day of your dream. As for sadness, it will wear off, saying it will not be reviewed. Say no. No, I am not seen or heard. And leave me sad, Achille, and worries
One of the worst hotels. I did not like anything. Everything is bad
First of all, the book is not a novel but rather connected philosophical thoughts. The book contains some good ideas, but I could not bring it down to reality as it talks about a warrior and a sword, and some of them were vague to me, perhaps because the translation of the book was not good at all. Maybe read it again with another translation
The service is bad. I did not like anything and do not recommend it. The service is bad and the staff are not helpful
Light and cute book: Introduce me to some of Twitter&#39;s most famous people
Two stars. The first in appreciation of Plato. The second in appreciation of the effort. As for the book ... bad format. Duplicate entire pages. Repeat lines within pages .. Repeat the idea in more than one style. Just copy and paste. It is not very different from the topics in the Arab forums. The book can be summarized in one page or less.
In the needs of a lot more than a lot of work .. Just a six-man look .. She works with girls. A very bad book. Two stars for some of the stories that touched me, its sensitivity and the sense of its heroes. Sweet feelings of love that are in it. But in general I was very disappointed.
I don’t know where to start. From the most insignificant and worst novels that I have read over many years, I never expected that the writing of Yusef Zidan would be so bad, especially since I started reading Azazel and it is completely different from the shadow of the snake. Failed .. The book from the small pieces is composed of a page. If he had made it white pages, it would have been better. I consider it a stigma in the history of Arabic literature. An empty sexual story at the beginning followed by letters that tell the history of th A sacred female, no creativity or imagination, a narrative that summarizes an empty trivial story, then a historical narration of female history as if you were reading Wikipedia in a short waste of time. I was thinking of giving her two stars due to some aesthetic in literary language and style, until I reached the horrific end, so I canceled a star because of the bad conclusion, which I classify as the worst conclusion of a novel in the history of Arabic literature
disappointing. Location and lobby. The room is narrow, there is only a balcony in limited rooms, the carpet is dirty, and the air conditioner is tired.
Light humor .. fairy tales suitable for children, without cartoons, cartoons
it&#39;s OK . . Bad bed, kitchen not clean
A bad experience . The hotel is beautifully designed but poorly run. The price was high and I did not expect it to be bad. This corridor, which only leads to the suite. There were laundry purposes for the rooms. Quilts and towels were thrown into the corridor. Also the entrance to the hotel there are maintenance works and God knows the entrance the design of the hotel is beautiful and the operation was not very very bad. She worked out, and after hours, a public relations employee spoke to me, followed the hotel and asked about my stay, how bad was her experience. She was bad and couldn&#39;t. She said again, we will satisfy you, but give us a good evaluation. I do not recommend it
A ridiculous book in every sense of the word ... all words are repeated and provocative
I liked some points in it, but not much: |
The location of the apartments is scary. Good reception service. Free Wi-Fi near the airport. The place is against the industrial price, the price was very annoying industrial and the planes bed was uncomfortable
A boring book that lacks bonding, an empty philosophy
Free hair
One of the worst I&#39;ve ever read. The closest you will be to a novel in a forum. Tale of the most distant between a sweetheart and his sweetheart, in which the writer tried to deviate from. The usual range of adding some Arabic and English quotes at the beginning of some chapters .. I will speak in this review about one point that provoked me in the book. All of the book spoke at length about the feeling of guilt, sadness, etc. ... but the only thing that must be felt from him was that he did not pay any attention and made him pass through the honorable passage, which is the disgusting vice. . How the craving of the innocent pure gave him herself, how can she be pure and innocent by dedicating herself to the forbidden. I criticize this for the writer because ultimately a Muslim man and thousands of teenage girls will read this book and think it is a good thing as long as you fall in love. At the same time, I do not criticize this for foreign writers, so that this is their life, and that is their thoughts and beliefs .. I know that it is the freedom of the writer, but I think that the writer is like a writer with an Islamic religion that shoulders himself with what I call an intellectual awakening so the writer should not forget His religion is called literature. For this reason, I find myself moving away from the Saudi writers in particular, many of them deny themselves with his book and find it puts everything that has suppressed himself under this title and it is calculated that there is no literature in literature .. Finally:. Bad book, trite story.
A star hotel, not a star. Just near the sanctuary. The hotel does not deserve more than the stars, the furniture is very old, the bathrooms are worn out, the chapel is free, the adaptation is very poor, the buffet is bad and not worth more than a riyal.
disappointing. . A crowded area without parking
It was not like the first ... The apartments were excellent and I would not recommend visiting them now .... bad compared to their previous periods. Water wastes, furniture, consumers, and the kitchen.
where do I start?. A non-scholarly, non-scientific narrative, silly vision, and the book does not offer much of what the Book of Religion does in the elementary school curricula. After the writer presented a summary of the degradation experienced by non-Islamic societies and non-Islamic religions, the writer moves to talk about the Islamic state, the glory, the justice that he has attained and his welfare ... and military sovereignty, which according to the writer is the standard of civilization and the criterion of scientific excellence at the same time criticizing the Arabs&#39; work in philosophy and science Speech and infidel pagan Aristotelian logic. To speak briefly afterwards about the reason for the decline of the Arabs, which is simply the loss of Islamic leadership. At the end of the book, he calls for the restoration of this leadership that will restore God’s law and which women will return to adulthood after competing with men in the infidel West, and which will achieve military power and independence from the West ... etc. etc. etc. This is the book. Where is the new ?. I am not in the process of discussing the writer&#39;s idea about the utopia of the Islamic state imported from the system of Islamic colonial conquests ... but I am surprised by the spread of a book like this .. His reading was real psychological torture .. One of the stories mentioned by the writer as a matter of pride in what we have come to: That the Christians in Andalusia feared Muslims a lot, and the Pope did not dare utter a word, and that when Muslims left Andalusia, the Pope held a three-day festival on this occasion. The writer thinks that this is mined and proud ... my wonder. Is this how the writer understands the phrase mercy to the worlds ??
From a lot of what I heard talk about the novel, I expected that it is a novel above the ordinary .. When I started reading it, I found it less than the normal .. I felt bored, and there were no mere comments, nothing more .. Almost sated with events. Truth is in the last part of the novel. In my opinion, not worth the fuss. Just two stars.
If articles remained in the newspaper, it would be better
Bad . Reception staff. The furniture is old and dirty
Fertile imagination, not more
Very weak. . Visitors refused what works for young people
The same idea is repeated on several pages. Nothing added to me
Star because it is invasive. And a star for some of the pages I liked
The worst apartments I entered. . Worn out furniture. Doilies are not clean. The price exceeded the price approved by tourism and my complaint against tourism was accepted
I do not repeat it. Its proximity to the sanctuary. Actually it is not a normal hotel photos and not worth the paid amount
The end is unexpected but weak and the details are many and boring: |
In reality, the star is for the title and the cover. As for the content, it is very superficial. All of its ideas and suggestions are superficial and not surprising. The writer is almost in most of the chapters all his solutions and his words to the woman that she who works and must behave and is required and the few needs that were addressed in it to the need of the man on it work in spite of the problem with the man but all his solutions that the woman must work is because of the problem this is a transgression of medicine and it is permissible for him and pain before her Why is it the whole night?
Bad hotel. Its proximity to the sanctuary. Services, breakfast and hygiene
the translation is bad
If I could pull this orphan out of it, I would. This narration extends boldly to Islam. I really don’t know how Muslim readers give it all this attention. Then from this Shams al-Tabrizi, who claims to have a better position than the apostles, he claims that he speaks to God and God fulfills his desires for him, and even compares himself with our green master. There is also a great distortion in the data of Islam and its meanings .. I do not recommend reading the novel and am surprised by every Muslim who praises and promotes it. I was also very disappointed with Yasser Al-Harib, who was on my favorite book list
The book is a chapter in which the author discusses many things about the existence of a god and clarifying the differences between religions, but I was waiting for a deeper analysis and a broader perspective on things, in my opinion a good book for beginners with these matters, but readers will find that the book contains repeated information, but this does not mean that it is a book that is not good, and the author is clear He is educated: you can think of it as an invitation to reflect
It&#39;s a charlie gift, Charlie
Salamat. Clean. Because of the high rating. The owners of the hotel raised the price and became the price of a five-star hotel. This is called exploit
A light book can be separated from two books that say I did so:. In the stories of him, I felt that she was speaking with my tongue in many situations, but in the stories of a goal that has no purpose and what I liked most about it: the beauty of the world and the truth of things Morsi was defeated, man. Simple reasons
A good attempt to make a novel and not a novel in the familiar sense .. wonderful and automatic subjective thoughts combined by weak fictional frameworks ... the writer&#39;s language is certainly distinct and is the strength of the work, but not by style alone the writer produces good fiction or fiction
The place is bad and the deal is worse. Sei is not like because the reception is bad. If their reception is bad, then what do you hope?
Weak. I liked the hotel because it is new and good insulation between rooms. There is no parking, the internet is weak, the minibar has nothing, and the prices for services such as laundry and breakfast are very expensive
Unfortunately I did not read any of the writings of Ghassan Kanafani in order to have a picture .. I do not know that my reading of his letters to his quail poison had spoiled that path and blocked it in front of me ... .. I did not see in the book a boldness from Mrs. Ghada, one of my favorite writers, as she indicated in the introduction or as critics pointed to it .. I saw him glorify a love relationship in which she was the strongest and most controlling .. The weak in front of his love .. And Ghassan Kanafani was not an ordinary man, but was a well-known scientist and fighter. Why did she choose to reveal In front of his love after a long warrior Basil appeared before the issue of his homeland? Because I do not know his style, I did not stop much in front of most of the published messages, but I stopped long before the last message .. which he sent to her in the form of his sister, Faiza ... is the best in everything that was published and perhaps that is why I left her to be the conclusion of the book.
The problem is that I have read more creamy and detailed books. So I did not like this book
Boring .. long .. I never liked it
I am not a Crescent, but federally. The book is about crescent and love at the same time
This novel made me sick. Inside me, I found obsessions, doubts, pessimism, and every sense of his inner darkness. Sometimes I wonder .. It may be that the blackness that covers the novel is what distinguished it. Will it be interesting if it is black? I do not know, maybe. A very interesting ether style .. but I was stunned by her conclusion to the novel. At least write something to me in the end that compensates me for the feeling of illness that I feel? a. While paying my respects to Athir, the novel received a hype that it never deserved. The method of ending the novel and the darkness of most events was raised and its dependence on writing many many dialogues. Bomb all the noise I was holding inside me. I liked some beautiful details that happened between Aziz and Jumana. She foretold a lot of passion for the writer. Finally. I am sick and feel disgust with this love story. May God heal me and all who feel it. Forgive you, Alpari, raise: /
His idea is a duplicate of previous books I read. But I loved the design and the name of the book that initially attracted me harmony
. The staff are kind. The two rooms were not ready and I arrived. In the afternoon, the two rooms accommodate two people or two beds, but unfortunately the room was a family for information. The room is equipped with two beds, unfortunately, Crown Plaza, this Misteri stars, unfortunately. Instead of SAR, and I told them I did not book from you, they contacted u. Pocking and they do not wish to contact with you except after my insistence that I pay the amount of what is on your side, which is SAR, and when they wrote to me, he analyzed for me who is supposed to write for you and not for me and for this information to them I received from you for the price of the two rooms for two nights and if I did not attend on the day of booking SAR is deducted from me and I came and paid the amount
Very weak. . The location of the place is not suitable when busy exit
Outrageous This hotel may be tricky at first sight so you see it attractive, and it has a nice beach, and outside resorts resemble the village. The room was dirty, the towels were dirty and stained, the bathroom was grotesque, the tiles in it were falling and falling, the faucet came out of it brown water, broken broken beds with a spring mattress, and a thin wallpaper. Breakfast was acceptable but the options weren&#39;t so many. As the previous commenter said, we had to endure the miserable experience of staying behind a trip behind the Egyptian police. This hotel seduces a deceptive temptation, do not fall into it, and it is simply very outrageous. A good cover does not mean that the book is good.
A novel that does not deserve evaluation .. Too bad
Classics of disputed love. Four main models in the novel: the female characters in the novel enjoy strength compared to the male characters in which submission, submission, clear surrender, crushing under the weight of external societal, political, and introverted circumstances and the inability to make decisions are feast .. Eid and Sylvia The love between a Muslim and a Christian who is met with refusal to resort to satisfying him despite all Something in spite of the nose of the family, society and religion .. And Mary and the dreamer writer who is vocal about everything, even God, is an example of love that he fears .. neither does he want to preserve him nor does he want to break from him .. He is a model for the person who fears for his love so much of everything and decides not to commit Towards him To me at all, even if he is full as a thief or as a bat, afraid of darkness being exposed by him .. Mary is the opposite of the writer .. realistic .. wise .. crazy .. sad and angry sometimes and happy sometimes .. Eid in the opposite of the writer tried in every way to take a legitimate path For his love, even if he abandoned his religion, the sub-characters in the novel were truncated, incomplete at all, as if they were used as a filling for the events of the scarce novel and a contribution to speeding up its monotony ... despite the influence of society and the political climate in the background of the events as it sensed it; and its impact on The characters of the story that suffer the defeat, but it came as a little separate from the events though His close relationship. I would have liked the writer to have paid a little attention to this part .. Ibn Arabi, the cordon of jasmine and the mystical atmosphere that was appearing lightly. I would have liked to have elongated a lot, but he gave the novel a special glow and a transparent spiritual dimension .. There is no doubt that the scattered sexual details caused a lot of distress and distracted me. About integrating into events .. In my opinion, part of the writer&#39;s creativity is to convey to his reader the feeling he wants without using an explicit or detailed description of sexual scenes, and without causing alienation from the rest of the novel as a whole. This has been preceded by many writers who succeeded in developing using the most exemplary, gentle and sweet words, which give the suggestion without provoking imagination or putting images in mind without permission or prior preparation, especially since I consider that the reader during the novel is without other types of intellectual books that require Realizing the mind with her delivers somewhat his imagination and mind to the writer, so he inclines the characters and identifies with them. The writer should also respect those who read to him and take into consideration the quality of his reader with different directions of readers and the general character of the committed Arab reader .. In general, I was not convinced of it as a novel, perhaps because of the recurring narration technique in letters that sometimes send boredom and which inspired me that I am only opening a memoir book To read from him, no narrated novel related to the events .. It is as in the subtitle on the cover .. Letters .. Despite the beauty of the language, the transparency of words and the beautiful judgment of life .. However, there are incomplete things .. Finally: it is not among the novels that I can recommend to others.
You shouldn&#39;t be throwing yourself out of the role you were throwing from above the World Trade Tower ... In principle, the only value of the book is that you know that the kidney is the same across generations and they are not alien to those of their contemporaries ... and they are a moving mass of incurable mental diseases that walk on two legs .. their smell is brutal .. and they have forgotten their path of forgetting ... an insignificant amount using words that are made in normal speech, natural that increases the chasm between Benko and the people who are willing to take advantage of it and call him the ordinary people and see him not knowing until he liberates himself .. what is natural they see you animals Nadra .... : //. . /. /. . . All the time, talk about the political struggle, not a struggle, or a policy ... Your struggles and what you sacrificed? . What is the seasoned policy in your words? . A number of outmoded minds were affected by failed approaches, exotic all over the world, their corner on the shelf, salvation ... all the time, the acid cylinders that we hear comfortably about the revolution and salvation ... but for what, or for what? . Cylinders for an adolescent or advanced adolescent case, confused, goal and thought .. but it is that and salvation .. bleak blight because of this and salvation .... and then you are surprised why did they fail and frustrate and commit suicide ...? . If you were focused in your country, history, civilization and race ... the Egyptian nationalism and the rest of you are like pumpkin extending its righteousness ... you were happy ... that you were flirting with communism..and Marxism The only difference between us and the Bahamians who likened them at the present time is that most of them do not know the difference between the bourgeoisie from the Cuz of Dura ... but Kalku Shayfin Inco, but what is true and a nation that there is no god but God is wrong .. arrogance leads to destruction ... Whoever stops us when they get you and commit suicide and rest from everything that comes to us .... : //. . /. /. It is not freedom to irrigate
I didn&#39;t like that much. It concerns women and postpartum depression. I did not find that I was interested in reading about this topic
Very, very, very, unfortunately. Unfortunately. Everything is small and uncomfortable. The service is very, very, very bad. Speak to the hotel owner, complained and promised me the best. Unfortunately, I did not see any improvement. His level is very meager.
We arrived according to the reservation, and we waited, so the reception went to Morocco with my children and waited a long time. Nothing at all. Frankly, it was a failed experience by choosing this place. The service is non-existent ... the entire service is ...
Under the slogan of independent cinema, you must go beyond what you want. The genius of the first experience lies in the difference in innocence in smoothness, and this was done by the editor, director, and director Ahmed Abdullah completely in his first experience. Heliopolis movie. This film belonging to the so-called independent cinema, that cinema that came to light in search of freedom Outside the grip of major production companies. In Heliopolis, the difference in everything was in the scenario, lighting, montage, sound, and sometimes acting. Ahmed Abdullah and his team succeeded in breaking several tabs on top of which was the movie scenario, as the film is almost without a story, and there is no dramatic conflict in it or any climax, and the characters are also completely superficial. Unpainted, you move on paper and you remain trapped during the movie without meaning or aim, causing you to be affected. The lighting of the film is a miraculous rebellious thing, which is only flawed because it is not present in the internal scenes and sometimes not in the external scenes. As for the stranger, it is the montage, as the director of the work has experience in the field of montage, and when he made his first movie as a director and wrote his story and his scenario, he chose a story for four separate dramatic strings that he only collects in Heliopolis. It is known that such quality needs a very sensitive and accurate montage to make The viewer does not feel the transition from one thread to the next, but from the seemingly long-term difference, the moves were terrifying at times, uncomfortable at all times. Even here the difference ends and the innocence adopted by the director in the performance of his actors begins and everyone falls into the trap of inattention, except for a little. Khaled Abu Al-Naja is a spotlight in the film with his smooth and persuasive performance. Hanan Mutawi led a character who almost drew well within the limits of the amputated character dramatically, even if the mistake was not her fault. Fair unconvincing performance and an attempt to perform the introverted personality by looking at the land and hum for the degree of illness Yusra al-Louzi is still satisfied with her beautiful face only on the screen either. He damaged the dramatic streak of the soldier as a whole and made him a short film inside the film, and the genius that they announced did not appear in these scenes. And it remains smooth to transfer this independent film to the film strips to be displayed in theaters under the independent movie slogan, as if that sentence should be after. If the possibilities of this cinema do not allow all of this, and we have to overlook it in order to move to another level on the ladder of independent cinema, it remains to shout at the filmmakers all the amount of boredom that inhabited the film from its inception until the end of it to the extent that even the sympathizers of the first experience lost their sympathy. Finally, Heliopolis remains alive, and the film is not a wonderful life. Its history cannot be reduced to the time of foreigners, the fifties and earlier, and the new millennium in a humiliating shorthand for about forty years from the history of the neighborhood and Egypt as a whole. A final note: When making a movie about Heliopolis, please refer to laughing, playing, grandfathering and love for Tariq Al Tlemceni, and in the apartment of Heliopolis for Muhammad Khan.
Unhappy place. nothing. The least described as a dirty place .. It is similar to the apartments in the highway stations
disappointing. The pool and outdoor garden. The amount is overrated for the services provided in the villa, the kitchen is not equipped and the staff are not interested in serving guests
Bad . Luxury furniture. Services are very slow. Log in to the room. It took a very long time. The room was not ready at the time of our arrival, although we provided after the written time of registration on the site. The hotel is large. The rooms are very far away. It requires you to climb two different elevators. The rooms and the large hotel make workers late to bring in the simplest requests
disappointing. Close to the campus. Lack of response from the room service request and poor sleeping bed
disappointing. A clean beach and a jet ski. Cabins are not as clean as there should be young people without families
The worst reservation. No, it&#39;s not tasty. The hotel service is poor and the staff are not present at the reception, the reservation has been confirmed to us and the amount has been withdrawn.
In the opinion of Zakaria Ozon, we should not take from the Sunnah except the rulings, sermons, and accidents of history, and leave other than that. Ibn Omar, Aisha, Abu Huraira and Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, these people have committed greatness in their lives, so how can we consider them fair and they have spilled the blood of Muslims and ate their money according to Zakaria’s expression of course .. What is stated in the Sunnah .. On the other side, we do not disagree that there are weak and even developed hadiths in Bukhari and others, especially those related to the Supreme Self, but we did not adopt the criterion of reason in weakening everything and it is the link of the dispute with the writer, so it is directed in a purely rational way.
Kafka mazes, swirls and absurdity
Too bad it doesn&#39;t deserve to be called a hotel or resort. There is no admiration, and I hope that it will be removed from the buking. Hygiene and inconvenience and there is no response from management
In short, the book disappointed me..a frequent talk, and it seems to me that the writer tired of investigation and scientific research and relied on personal conclusions. I was tempted to describe the book as a PhD and expected that I would read a documented and authentic book in the research, not a hadith similar to newspaper articles.
Whatever you read to Paulo Coelho, you will prefer the best alchemist narration
O God, this sadness has no limits .. as the homeland of Palestine. Safia is the wife who follows the cause, searches for the homeland, cries for the suffering of the man and oppresses him, Safia in this story is the entire Arab people who are only able to express their position in front of the Palestine issue with tears, while Saeed is our absent conscience, it is the self-governing questions: ? .
To see.
Weak. The breakfast is not delicious and the bed is not comfortable.
Granoy is this tormented boy who possesses great talent, those powers in the world, his ability to smell things and know their exact contents, which was the reason for his survival on life and in him as well ... a somewhat strange story, the writer got me bored in many times I was anxious to know the end of Gernoui and what happened to him .. And behind the events I felt the extent of human insignificance and their panting behind rumors and fame; false beauty; O people, do you want enough money, power and hegemony? what do you want ? . Myths and delusions will be despicable lust for a man to seize weak souls less impure than him to believe it; who are you, O man, to do all this because he thinks that no one will punish you, God will slow down and neglect. .. forget about yourself ..
Excerpts from the novel &quot;The Rules of the Forty Love&quot; by Elif Shafak. . She knew that their relationship was not deep, but she said to herself that it is not necessary for the emotional bond to occupy a priority in the list of married couples, especially for a married couple. A long time has passed since their marriage. In marriage, things are much more important than passion and love such as understanding, affection, mercy, and more The divine things that any husband may offer is forgiveness, but love is secondary compared to all these things unless one lives in the folds of novels or romantic films where heroes always depict larger people from life and their love is nothing but a myth. . As if you can get to know a man’s personality during eight months. My father and I have been married for twenty years, and yet we cannot pretend that one of us knows everything about the other that eight months is not considered anything in any relationship. . The twenty-first century does not differ much from the thirteenth century and they will note in history that these two centuries were an era of religious conflicts to an unprecedented extent and an era in which cultural misunderstanding and a general feeling of insecurity and fear of the other prevailed and in such times the need is To love more severe than ever. . When you kill someone, something of him transmits to you a sigh, smell, or gesture. I hang them around my neck like hidden necklaces. I feel they are firmly and heavily above my flesh. Even though I do not feel comfortable, I used to live with this burden and accepted it as part of my job. . . Inside each person there is a hidden desire to kill one of them one day, and people do not realize this until after they have spoken to them, they think that they are unable to kill, but the issue is a matter of conscience only. Sometimes a mere gesture is enough to fan their anger. One is in the wrong place and at the wrong time, as destructive tendencies can appear in people who are kind and respectful people in normal circumstances, as anyone can kill anyone, but no person can deliberately kill a stranger. . Believe me, there is nothing new. I have clients from the most parts of the world. After dosing some cups, I hear the same stories from all of them. People are themselves everywhere, the same food, the same water, and the same old folly. . The way in which we see God is only a reflection of the way we see ourselves, so if God did not bring to our minds nothing but fear and blame, then this means that a great deal of fear and blame is flowing in our souls, but if we see God filled with love and mercy, we will be like that. . This is how life is. When you tell someone the truth, he hates you, and the more you talk about love, the more it hates you. . Whatever we are or wherever we live, we feel in our hearts that we are incomplete, as if we lost something and must recover it, but most of us never find that thing. As for those who can find it, very few dare to go out and search for it. . Do not judge the way people communicate with God. Each person has his own way and prayer that God does not take us with our word, but looks in the depths of our hearts, not rituals or rituals that make us believers, but whether our hearts are clear or not. . One of the things that helped me personally in the past to stop interfering in the affairs of others around me and when I was frustrated months that I would not be able to change them I was instead of intrusion or negativity I was inclined to acquiescence some people mistake when they mix between compliance and weakness, so compliance is a form of peaceful acceptance On the terms of the universe, among which are things that we cannot currently change or understand. . Thought and love consist of different materials. Thought binds humans in a contract, but love dissolves all nodes. Thought always warned, and he advises: Beware a lot of euphoria, while love says: Do not care. I take this risk and while thought cannot fade. Easily, love collapses easily and becomes a rubble on its own, but the treasures are hidden between rubble and the broken heart hides treasures. . Most of the world&#39;s problems stem from linguistic errors and from a simple misunderstanding that does not take words in their apparent meaning at all, and when the circle of love enters, the language that we know is outdated. The thing that cannot be expressed in words can only be perceived by silence. . Loneliness and being alone are two different things. When you are alone, it is easy to fool yourself and imagine that you are on the right path. As for being alone is better for us because it means being alone without feeling that you are alone, but in the end it is better for you to search for someone who is like a mirror You remember that you cannot really see yourself except in someone else&#39;s heart and with God in you. . No matter what happens in your life, and no matter how troublesome things appear, do not enter despair, and even if all the doors remain closed, God will open a new path for you. Ahmed, your Lord, it is easy for you to praise God when everything is fine. The Sufi praises God not only for what He granted to him, but praises Him Also for everything that God has forbidden it. . Patience does not mean that you bear the difficulties negatively, rather it means being far-sighted so that you trust the end result that will result from any process. What does patience mean? It means that you look at the thorn and see the rose, you look at the night and see the dawn. As for impatience, it means that you are short-sighted and you cannot see the result that God&#39;s lovers never run out of patience because they know that in order for the crescent to become full, it needs time. . There is no big difference between east and west, south and north. Whatever your destination, you must make the journey you take a journey inside you. If you travel inside you, you will be able to cross the vast world and beyond. . When the midwife finds that the pregnant woman does not suffer during labor, she knows that the path is not clear for her newborn, so she will not give her newborn if and in order to generate a new soul, it must be pain and just as the clay needs high heat to intensify, love is not complete except with pain. . The pursuit of love changes us, so no one seeks love and matures during his journey, so when the search for love begins, it starts to change from inside and outside. . There are fake teachers and fake professors in this world with many stars in the visible universe. Do not confuse selfish people who are motivated by power and true teachers. An honest spiritual teacher directs your attention to him and does not expect absolute obedience or complete admiration from you but rather helps you to appreciate yourself The Ministry of the Interior respects that true teachers are as transparent as crystal passing through God&#39;s light through them. . Because you are very careful to obtain the approval of others, you will not get rid of their criticism, no matter how hard you try. . Do not try to resist the changes that stand in your way, but let life live in you and do not worry if you turn your life upside down so how do you know that the side you are used to is better than the side that will come. . I do not think that there is a problem with sadness, but rather the opposite is hypocrisy that makes people happy. As for the truth, it makes them feel sad. . The true filth lies inside, while the other filth is removed by washing, and there is one type of filth that cannot be cleansed with pure water, which is a pollute of hatred and intolerance that pollutes the soul. . If a person wants to change the way in which people treat him, he must first change the way in which he treats himself and if he does not learn how to love himself completely and sincerely, there is no way in which he can love, but when he reaches that stage he will thank every thorn that others have thrown at him. This indicates that Roses will rain down soon, then how can one blame others for not respecting him if he does not consider himself worthy of respect. . The past is a vortex, if you let it dominate your present moment, it will absorb you and sweep you away from what time is but an illusion and all you need is to live this very moment. This is all that matters. . Do not care where the road will lead you, but focus on the first step, as it is the most difficult step that you must take responsibility for. Once you take that step, let everything happen naturally and the rest will come by itself. Do not go with the current, but be the current. . The Internet has exaggerated behavior outside its scope and made it gentle, giving the opportunity to flirt without having to feel guilty and adventurous without risk, as if to eat delicious, forbidden food without worrying about you due to the extra calories. . How can love be so serious?
Perhaps at the time it was not so consumed and ordinary. But she still raises an important question, does the girl answer to tell her partner about her past, or will he never accept our implicit? Will still doubt. I think frankness is obligatory, but without details of my past it may spoil the reality .. This is the only meaning of this very short novel.
Narrow slow narration exaggerated educational advice for a strong woman as usual dreams in the personality of the spokesperson for women&#39;s rights dreams actually represents the personality of Najla in the personal novel that gives you a summary of her failed experiences in life I did not like the narration on the tongue of the narrator and her bias all the time to the heroine, and if she deserves to be a woman like her only, I do not deny my deep sympathy for the hero’s personality despite his extreme selfishness, arrogance, and lack of rid of the power of money over him, but the character that raises. Your sympathy is many times because of his excessive love for himself. The music was the master of the scene, but the novel is the least that describes it. It is an ordinary novel that has many formal creativity, image aesthetics and appropriate decoration for the characters, but it lacks the elements of attraction, surprise, and boring only to a large extent in the narrative habitats and Its historical part.
Fun to read, what fun. What a name brilliantly chosen by the author. Honestly, I was deceived. I did not find in the book a talk about any pleasure in reading. I had never known before reading it as an educational book. I thought he would talk about the pleasure of reading that reaches the point of addiction. Be fascinated by all those lines contained in books. And the constant passion for ending more and more of them and digesting them well. As a worm read, I expected this book to be a fun dose. Inside, I will find those who share in me madness, passion, intimacy and love for reading. But he was discussing the problem of dyslexia. And compare it to television and cinema. Imposing parents to read to become a boring task like hell. Really, all prohibitions are desirable. He went on to describe the boy’s torture as he tried to end that heavy imposition. Wow, he had to call the book the torture of reading or the inferno of reading. It is not a pleasure to read. The last part is about the rights of the reader. You will agree with him in some of them and will differ with him in others. But in the end, reading is life. Reading is a special lifestyle, a pure personal journey. Better to fight it alone without a guide. You discover it yourself, with your own mind without determining your last view of it. Create your own laws of what you see as right and preferred. What you deem unpalatable. You have the right to re-read, jump on pages or other rights. They are flexible rights, and it is you who grant and give them as soon as you start reading the book. When the book becomes your slave, the writer says. Overall, quite a bit. Small but despite his smallness some boredom. It is best to read it as an educational book. And do not proceed with great hopes and wide. The reading worm also did its expectations. Done
Possibly the lowest set of stories of her village by Youssef Idris
A Book Below the Author&#39;s Book How creation began much, and is quite boring.
The poetic texts of the anecdotal stories are distracting when they are combined between the two covers of a book .. The symbolism in abundance loses the text of its poetry and the beauty of its meanings. This type of book doesn&#39;t suit me.
Not worth the money the hotel spends cannot be considered three stars, at least by European standards. expensive. The air conditioner was not working, the bed was uncomfortable and I had back pain for six days. No internet and computers, TV shows were only broadcast in Russian. Breakfast was not exceptional, only a positive note is its proximity to the subway.
Weak. . You cannot sleep from the music
The resort is ok but the housekeeping kebe is so bad for not responding. Independence security reception. The furniture is old, room service is very bad, bad handling, except reception
Scattered halls are not worth reading, no idea, no purpose, no meanings. Narrative of very ordinary and boring events. And discuss old ideas like Darwin&#39;s theory. Obeikan in a aware footsteps. Production level fall
I think that she did not reach the stage of the novel by her footsteps, as a good start for the first book he writes. There are some illogical, strange and unconvincing events. However, there is a sentence that I liked very much about the problem of a man in the East. He puts a woman in the position of angels, exaggerates the formation of an idea about it, and he forgets that it is human.
Tawfiq Al-Hakim, his donkey and a stick are a unique style of satirical literature. I think I will never think of reading to him again, because his cynical style does not fit the thinking of the modern generation
The verbosity and long description of the surroundings of the protagonists sends boredom and the lack of desire to complete it .. but the content is beautiful and deserves patience and reading ... if you are the ones who get bored quickly .. I do not advise you to read it ..
You can only appreciate the value of a thing after losing it ... You have a desire that expresses your gratitude and love, but postpone as if the person will be with you forever. The story is painful, the mother gave a clarification and she did not complain and she believed that it was shortened but they did not see anything
The Branch: The Red Families Branch, the service is excellent, the menu is varied and delicious. Pasta with their different kinds of delicious sandwiches and soups with all kinds of dishes is also great. Among the requests was salmon and it was very delicious
The meal between breakfast and Sunday lunch was disappointing .... it will not happen again. As a frequent guest at Ritz in Nablus, my first thought about my mother&#39;s 80th birthday celebration was to have a meal between breakfast and lunch at the Ritz in Fort Lauderdale close to our home. She informed the host about the date we booked and assured us that the Ritz will make a wonderful celebration for this occasion. A dollar later, no cake, no candles, no good wishes, nothing service was poor and the restaurant was half full. The host made no effort to make up for his services even after alerting him that the restaurant had dropped the ball at the Christmas celebration stadium. I would get a better welcome and service at Pancake House for / from this price.
disappointing. . There are no windows or cleanliness
A gloomy narration of the utmost limits, which I did not like. It weighed heavily in its reading, and it clouded a cloud of sadness and gloom: I do not recommend it
I don&#39;t know why it is possible that we consider it a book in the first place? . And what do you know, why is it called the purple book? Jays, because purple is the original color of black tangerine, which is named in English. It is possible to walk a note entry filled between two covers. No more wasting time
.. We come from a dark abyss and we end up with a similar one. As for the bright distance between the two cliffs, we call it life .. .. You read the book, surprising from it. You see the reviews shocked and believe that you were reading something amazing to the extent that you did not understand anything. . I admit that the time and mood are not appropriate for talk about meditation and the philosophy of insignificance, so I hated the book from the first line. I felt stupidity while reading the reviews. Everyone discovered creativity in the novel, but I understood nothing. God willing, we will give him a new attempt after how many years ..
A satirical book .. It rises to the level of the printed book .. It can be just on Facebook .. Comedies .. Light .. No more. Dislike ..
Never clean. . The bathroom was the dirt of God Almighty, in which I found the hair of a person before me who was living in the same level something very disgusting.
The best solution for those who suffer from insomnia
I do not know, I am very, very dispersed regarding my opinion in general in the book .. It is not a novel but closer to a self-book I do not say human development, but it addresses some of the desperate from life and its usefulness .. I hate open ends but rather detest it and therefore my judgment is incomplete on the novel because it is not a point
I did not like him frankly, because the events were known to me and all the justifications were dear actions that did not convince me nor sympathize with him ..
The hotel is prohibited, called the star. There is nothing that I like. Everything that makes the receptionist nervous. Ask him about the cutting of the bordeaux. He says I am empty and do not have a business center room. Everything is upset and their differences are commercial
Boring. It could be shortened. The idea is not new
A light book is normal, and all of its events are repeated every day, but you are looking for it with only one lesson. Two preachers are not happy while they are away from each other because in many situations, you get to abandon them, discover each other and understand some more. Not far away. The results of their actions remain beautiful and happy with understanding. Also, the opposite is possible. Discovering the characters leads to separation.
may Allah help . There is nothing I&#39;m talking about rubbish hotel. There is nothing I liked other than the place near the campus
The neighborhood is bad. . The neighborhood is very bad and frightening at night. You can&#39;t go down in it ... The parking is far away. It is possible to walk and impossible. Also, he received a car park even if he was away .. In short, it is impossible to come back to it again.
A very, very, very ordinary novel, whose characters are weak and some of them are ridiculous. And the very, very, very artificial character is Nour&#39;s, really enduring a kind of endless stirring. Nothing surprising There is no one in the novel who needs me to be stunned. I read the novel, and it is in a glass partition between me and it, not with emotion or with any need. In general, the novel needs a mistake, because it does not know what movement it takes. I am originally a person with an allergic reaction
I feel somewhat disappointed, as if you were browsing a literary account on Twitter.
My stay was good. Safety was good. Bus transportation from the hotel to the Sanctuary was poor
. My identity, my affiliations :. It is my identity that means that I am unlike anyone else. Your identity is not only your nationality, race or religion, but it is all together. It is all your big and small identities. Once one of these identities is threatened, they rise to the surface and overwhelm your other identities, which leads to violence .. When modernity comes from the other. We often see the influence of religions on their people, and on the contrary, we neglect the influence of peoples on religions. People make religions that make society. The time of the cosmic tribes:. These societies must make an effort to confirm, through prominent symbols, that they carry out their diversity so that everyone can identify with what they see around them, and that every person knows himself in the image of the country in which he lives, and feels encouraged to integrate into it rather than stay, as happens Most often, watching anxious and sometimes hostile. Taming the cheetah: Everyone should be able to own modernity rather than have the impression that they borrow it from others. The chapter talks about the importance of preserving and meaning the European Union with its components and multiculturalism and that the world preserves all cultures and languages and their dignity in any way ...
Good stay, but we hope to take care of the place cleanliness and bathroom maintenance. The room is large and clean but the bathroom is worn out. Breakfast is very bad
What I liked most about the novel is Ayman Al-Atoom&#39;s charming language, his sweet rhetoric and his ability to describe. . But the novel cannot be compared to the rest of his works, especially since they hear its senses
Too bad and so bad I spent nights, I read reviews before coming, but that was so terrible I couldn&#39;t imagine. The place was not very good compared to the hotels on Beyazit Street. Breakfast was very simple and traditional, the room was without good facilities like a star hotel. I am still amazed at what they call the internet hotel. Every minute is interrupted and its speed is poor. I asked him why there is no direct phone in the rooms. Six months ago I was at the Antik Hotel which was really excellent but this hotel does not even reach stars ....
His philosophy is mysterious and contradictory, as I have seen it, some nuggets as I called it, but in general it was a book that you want to get rid of quickly ... I felt sorry about him .. I feel that he was not happy and his life was marked by misery and misery in its entirety .. As if it carries a secret This universe alone. And sure of that .. But he never lived this universe
Frankly, I was not expecting something that I would like after reading the first book Memory of the Body .. But this book was very slightly better than the one before it and frankly I will read the last book of the trilogy because I only finish it ..
Detailed explanation of the evaluation with pros and cons. The location of the hotel was good, the bathroom had a bidet, unlike other hotels, it was a good breakfast speed, and I advise guests to book with breakfast. The Internet is expensive in the rooms, knowing that it is also weak, the presence of the Internet is free of charge in the lobby, which makes the lobby always crowded. I think this point was mentioned by the inmates previously. Cleaning the cups in the rooms is only by wiping them with a towel from the room towels that you may have used.
Yes, I prefer to read the biography of the novel, but I could not complete this novel for some reason. In fact, there are many events and stories that the author fought but she did not draw me or was somewhat creamy, despite the fact that the first chapters related to her childhood, her youth was very acceptable and fun too, suddenly Her narration style has become lukewarm and a bit like a hearty / boring class about modern history of Iran ... but I expect her well-known book to read Lolita in Tehran is different from this book .. If I read a book that read the history of Alberto Manguel, I would feel better.
. One of the worst novels that passed me. Whatever the disadvantages described by the writer ... there is never a need to enter into details, the absence of which will not prejudice anything and its presence will not add anything to the reader through the path of life of choice ... and not everything in life must be tried to know that it is painful or corrupting and if that is Freedom, so did its heroes find comfort in their lives or their deaths. It seems that the writer was interested in describing the severity of a void and the fluctuation of the heroes of the novel to the point that the novel itself resembled them. But there is something that really attracted me in the novel. . The most beautiful things will not be completed until the end .... she must die. And there is the most beautiful thing I have ever read: The second dedication of the writer in the first pages of the book. To the warm lightning .... which I met with his family in my heart .... and I will never escape it .... have mercy on me ..... calm down and settle down
The location is bad because it is above the mountain, and the deal is bad. What I liked most about the breakfast buffet in terms of quality items. Its location on the mountain is very tired. Staff handling is lacking in taste and professionalism. The level of rooms is weak and the furniture is Bali.
As a whole, the book was good, and the writer is clearly educated. There were some great clips that I loved so much .. but this book is missing something. Perhaps depicting the beloved of the hero in this novel was one of the things that bothered me the most: The writer was hoping to create a state of mystery and anticipation, and that the beloved would be wrapped in thick fog, making everyone who read the book think it was the intended one, and everyone who read the book thought that his beloved was the intended one. . So we communicate with the personality through ourselves. But the mistake I made is the extent of the mistiness of this character, as unlike all the characters who were real her character was like the ghost character, foggy and unrealistic as I could not as a woman communicate with him. Or even to try to liken it myself. A character never touched reality, so the clips that were the least attractive to me were the clips that remembered her.
The watch is not against the pure water
Unfortunately, it is a repeated story that has no idea ... but it is really the reality that happens in our society
The events are inconsistent at all. I mean the dates. It means that Egypt returned from Beirut and filed a case against Nasr. The case number was for a year. How does it mean, I do not understand ????. Away from that the book recounted events, many of which are real and the last preposterous in reality. The book portrays a period of Egyptian rule, but the truth remains missing in a vicious circle ?????. A second need, Khorshid&#39;s dependence, stated that all the men were going to die on it, and Salah in particular was dead in Ddebaha, could I know what was needed? A need for dedication. I would like to add it if Salah Nasr died, so most of the workers in the sovereign apparatus throughout the ages Salah Nasr, and inside each of us, Salah Nasr is a small person if he culminates in the position except from the womb of my Lord and other countries.
The star for the name of the author ... As for the content, it did not bring anything new.
Not honest. nothing. Failure to abide by the reservation. They put me in a room without Kaaba view as booked. They put me in a room with partial views of the Sanctuary Square
Terrible and bad service hotel was very poor. Khatami lost the gold that I put in the bathroom when I returned from outside. The crew does not answer the phone. Very bad service. Do not be proud of the crew. This hotel is bad for stay. Housekeeping entered my room and was stolen. There is no liability
A book that tells the story of Cheb Mohamed. Some Sahwa chose them. And his soldiers did not serve their goals that were not related to Islam, with his link ... It took him three hours to read it
disappointing. The site is good and close to the Noble Sanctuary. I made an online reservation via the Bukking website and did not arrive at the hotel, which delayed our entry into the rooms and we are extremely tired from us traveling. The parking is a poor condition and the security guards for the car parks are ineffective in dealing with customers. I booked two rooms and on the basis that the parking is secure and unfortunately I could not stop even a car One, and he claims that the positions are full .. Was it not taken into account that the required positions are equal to the number of rooms? And in the event that was not taken into account, why do you place the reservation that the car park is secure? Or is the number of parking spaces sufficient, but there are those who rent the parking spaces to other people? Go back on foot
Taha Hussein says: I am not afraid of classical except from the colloquial Perm. Taha Hussein Gab from the other, but his words are beautiful, smooth, interesting and funny at the same time, and we will express about the condition of a people and a whole period of time. I do not need a description, nor many words. I concluded that history is repeating itself and we are only repetitive roles in a repetitive movie
Very weak. I did not like anything about this hotel other than their humiliation in their accommodation and I do not encourage anyone to visit it. The reception is very bad, much is the amount recorded on the site is different from the amount taken from me, the amount was recorded and I take up almost a dirham of food, not good, uncomfortable.
If you are new to the type of friendly books, you will like it despite the fact that most stories are friendly on Facebook. The important thing is a book, because the totality is not a monster.
I did not like it, and I felt that I was lost from a lot of analogies, some of which were in need of a surprising relationship with each other, and also the ambiguity in them. However, it did not give her more than two stars:
I looked at it ... as if I was reading a chat or messenger conversation between two girls ... and a phrase often appeared. Hahaha .. distractions sometimes shorten or short ... simply:. A ridiculous work .. It does not rise to the level of the novel ... I can almost certainly say that it did not spread except because of its prevention ...
The first thing that I read to Ghada Al-Samman .. The book is a set of personal thoughts that Ghada wrote over the past three years .. The thoughts are very sincere in my opinion and a thin film .. Although I do not like this type of literature, the rich pictures that these thoughts abound in me To another world ... to the forests of Bologna, the street of the Champs-Elysées and the fallen autumn leaves .. I have received all the cases of love that the quail lived and that I expressed through these thoughts ..
How many pages is this novel? I read it to the pages of Al and I did not find a supplement for her. Is the end with that marriage and Joseph&#39;s letter, or is there a supplement for her? So far Farida was less than normal..If she touched on things other than marriage and those daydreams that were perhaps extraordinary .. Her awareness of her rights and her rebellion against traditions were the most beautiful in the novel.
She did not complete it, and I did not finish her because she is a group of asphalt outfit
The technique is nice, but it goes too far ... I don&#39;t think I can read it again
A monster, Sakka, the movie. A very monster, Sakka El Sakka. It does not have a role. It is appropriate for the artist Hany Ramzy Dora. Just a transformed one. As for Adorard, it was sweet. The interest is a course I liked more than the movie of Baba, the artist Dora by Edward. From Khaled Sarhan from Salah Salah from Falqa This is the second movie that I did not like, such as the movie Al Diller and Papa, but I hope I rest from the artist Ahmed Al Sakka for times that he does a work that is in a story and I hope that he does not do a hot scene. The revenues that the film has achieved have achieved a million and a thousand. In the opinion of the film, the worst movies of Eid Al-Fitr are terrible, but a terrible teta is much better than it and deserves the revenues that it achieved.
The novel is bold in relation to its spread in particular the parts in which I speak about politics, but as a very ordinary literary work ....
Very weak. . Cleanliness is an old bar for you and smells of smoking at the elevator
Not worthy of stars. The location of the hotel is good because of its proximity to the markets. The room smell is muffled as well, the smell of the windows locked moisture. The hotel needs to develop reception staff who are not smiling and unwelcome to the guests
Boring
Dragon eggs:
Weak. nothing. The crew and reception are cool to clean them.
I liked his boldness and his ironic style of criticism. The worst thing about the book was to insult people by their names, and to reduce the right of women.
A fleet of cars between the hotel and the campus April Fools. . There is one minibus that is controlled by the driver and adds to the hardship after the place, the irregular trips to the sanctuary, even during the same prayer times
Twitter on paper .... The book has simple ideas that get rid of the rule that we read daily in books and magazines .. but by changing the words and changing their places ... the method is a way to do and not do ... reprimanding from here and there .. problems for teenagers say a return to solve them but adolescents do not They read .. why not write ??
Weak. The location of the place is between shopping centers, restaurants and a pharmacy only. Bad reception, the staff were treated dry, I asked an employee to maintain the bathroom. Next day, the Wi-Fi was intermittent and almost there. The place is very narrow. The hotel street is one way worthy of the stars
He lacked some arrangement and clarification ... as if the writer relies that we are aware of what is in his mind
Bad . The place is new and elegant. Poor services and neglect of the guest and ignoring his requests, we waited a long time for some services, which forced us to resort to the hotel manager, as well as there are interruptions of water from the bathrooms, in addition to that it is far from the campus
I almost never benefited from it.
I do not know how . But I carry what contains the novel intelligence enjoyed by Alaa. As for the idea and plot and others somewhat weak
Very superficial book. We shall superficially display problems in our lives without precisely solutions, such as the uniform in our clothes in Egypt, knowing that there is a problem of unemployment and they talk about it a lot and no one says a solution. Another example from the movie &quot;Nazer Mabrouk&quot; is a pregnant woman who is pregnant with Mana Aref. She is pregnant, but she was born, doctor. The book contains a lot of funny stories, but I honestly don&#39;t have a pound in the book, so read the book, I don&#39;t have money, and Facebook is full of friends. I am after this book, I will write books, I also
A very hospitable book
The first half of the novel, Kum, and the other half, Kum Tani. In the first half, suspense, dramatic plot, and an attempt to make sense of the mind find a logical solution to puzzleing the story. As for the second half, in my opinion, fantasy is useless and meaningless
Two stars and my hand .. It does not deserve more than that ... I do not find any meaning for all these events that Zorba and the reader have gone through, nothing ..
Frankly, I was thinking that the worst novels were written by Al-Menoufy. But you surprised me the worst. What is this nonsense? And God really deprived, read a need issued by the publishing house itself mainly because the novel does not rise because it is a post that goes up on Elvis. Not to mention it remains a novel. No, and more importantly, the group stayed a little following you, who brought them here. What is the cheap atmosphere? If you continue at the same level, I wish you would be better. As for me, the story that I will show your name on, I will not cost myself to read its name in the first place
disappointing. Room size. Cleanliness and poor services
The writing style is interesting, police and exciting, but the writer portrays Adham Sabry that he is Superman so he gave us the impression that it is a series of science fiction series
Weak. Nice location, comfort and reception. The lack of integrated services for the health club Sauna and Bukhar
Not to move the room bags. I did not like anything. They have no parking for customers
The star of this ... I felt the top of the starchy and extrovert the first time I knew that she had helped the valley ... I felt that she answered me my right:
I will not repeat stay in this modest resort. The location is good but missing a lot of attention. I did not like the way of reception, hygiene and attention of visitors
Disappointing.
I read this book in a challenge to books about a book category in a field that you had not read before, and I meant science. The book came as a group of simple articles that link science with life affairs, such as politics, economics, wealth, and others. I wished to give the book more than two stars, but I actually found ideas that are fairly simple and traditional, which may be otherwise in her time, certainly in addition to feeling bored in many parts, which prompted me not to complete the conclusion by the end of the book .. The book remains a living example of the scientists ’thinking in this era And what is an honorable opinion in an important era in the history of the world, and this was the most important thing I learned from it
The disappointment I did not expect ... did not amount to all this success
Weak. Location only. Coffee bags presented in the rooms more than a year ago
The lack of Arabic speakers. I did not like anything. No one speaks Arabic. Unavailability of rooms with beautiful views. Breakfast price increased.
For western folks who are used to Jeddah fish, I tell them not to be excited about it. I ate there and there was no good food at all compared to Jeddah restaurants such as the coral lamb Badge etc. Soup is good, the shrimp means good, the shabati bread is excellent, frankly
The worst hotel. Only the location of the hotel is good. There is no interest in the guest nor cleanliness and the brushes are not clean and the rooms lack services. I called the reception regarding a problem with the air conditioner and during an hour no one came and there are no clear TV channels. The evaluation of this hotel should not exceed only a star on the site
Very weak. . The staff is not helpful and there is better than it and cheaper than it and also there is an abnormal inconvenience
If this is an Indian movie, it will not remain like this, it is more powerful than a very boring novel, strange events and repetition of the name of the novel in each chapter. I feel that it is a black and white movie.
Yesterday I finished reading the novel by myself and others by Jana Fawaz. The novel reminded me of the stories of Nawal Al-Saadawi. The female doctor’s notes are the origin that I surreptitiously read in my childhood. Yes, I was nine years old when I read Is Kind of a Book. The important thing is that we return to the novel. The story talks about a woman who suffers from the bad treatment of her husband and beat him to her, and how she escaped from this by entering into a forbidden relationship with a married man who finds the lost love with him. In the novel, the author reviews various stories of women: her mother, who lives with a sexually cold husband, her widowed friend, who was betrayed by love when death kidnapped her husband, and she became extinguished her instinct with temporary relationships with men, and the story of her aunt who died a virgin because she loved a man her father refused to marry. And other stories all revolve around the axis of women who are emotionally abused, physically robbed, and morally degenerate. The narration in the novel is traditional. The raving element is missing at the end of the novel. The events are realistic and may happen in any country or time .. We read them on the pages of Nawal El Saadawi and here we read them on the pages of Jana. Al-Rawya focused on raising the problems facing women, but it failed to find enough solutions. I wished we had a clearer end, better solutions, or good examples. We felt it was okay. Nothing to lose if you don&#39;t read the novel, so two stars are enough for it.
Just a literary presentation of the ancient Egyptian legend, in the form of a play .... I don&#39;t think there is anything new in it, or an addition.
Very bad . Unfortunately the hotel is very bad, I liked the location. Poor hygiene, bad services, bad furniture, very poor reception
Weak. The Hammamet hotel needs changing old bedding. Electricity is weak
Ghada and love once the word rises and once rock bottom. I do not see her as a writer or a poet, but she sometimes manages to capture some lines. A small Diwan can be used as a place of pilgrimage for the most passionate, and fortunately I am not among them. ,.
This story is long and it begins long before my birth, and requires patience to tell it and more patience to hear. In an old photo, Isabel Allende continues to tell the tales and stories of a group of strong women .. After Elza Summers, Rose Somers and Paulina Del Baye, the heroines of the daughter of fortune’s novel The first part of this novel .. In this part we continue with the granddaughter, the granddaughter of Elza and Paulina .. This part is weak and long and is driven by momentum Which was present in the first part .. It was a mixture of childhood diaries and Chilean history, which I found interesting and for some reason that did not raise me and did not interest me, this historical part and many other things overshadowed the story of the heroine and its existence was a little and not significantly significant although it is supposed to write about her life .
disappointing. Excellent handling style. Bathroom and toilet are very poor and very bad smells
One suppose that what he writes has a subject in his brain that he wants to communicate to people This talk is found in some of Ahmed Helmy&#39;s articles. Others do not. You may continue, but it is on a strong topic
Another shit is out of place. Well, I always have the same dilemma with books like this. Do I take it seriously? I discuss ideas, accuracy of transmission, correctness of information, presentation style, and writer style. Or do I set the record straight and say that this book is just another nonsense from what Ahmed Khalid writes? While I might like the book a little, it is still light in shade. However, I will not consider it a book in the full sense of the word. It is just thoughts. The writer saw that he had a good cultural kit that would qualify him to write on a subject of such importance, so he took advantage of his name and fame, and his many followers, who might buy even blank papers, just because his name is on them, so he took advantage of his luxury and decided to write this thing that I do not know him So far any precise name .. I have no objection at all to the idea of simplifying things a little, on the contrary, it is a good idea in any case. But to seek the help of your mighty imagination and add things that have nothing to do with existence and call this a summary of the most important philosophical ideas, this is the defect. Here it is, nothing, pure bullshit. It can make any passionate reader interested in knowing philosophy be satisfied forever and pastoralize just thinking about it again. Are you talking about foolishness? Or about the fallacies in the book? Or about the intense fooling of great ideas that are still fueling discussions in any intellectual arena? Or am I talking about the writer&#39;s disdain for his readers and distorting everything? In general, the book is ridiculous, full of fools, and never deserves neither the trouble of reading, nor the trouble of writing about it, but my anger of wasting my time decided to take revenge .. This book is a somewhat misrepresentation and distortion of the novel of a Sufi scholar, but of course in the form of a brief summary and disgraceful as well. Again, another attempt with books that parodied simplification of philosophy is failing .. I think this is the main reason, if you want to write then try even a little bit to stick to the sources and references. And not to deviate from the context of science and literature as well, but mockery and satire do not make me eager, of course, to read.
The Saudi morning reception employee is immoral and the hotel law and bathroom are without bidets. I did not like anything, and still take insurance. receptionist
I never loved it even though it contained two sweet ideas, but the writer was able to provide us with a detail of what they need.
A very weak novel. The loss of this idea is weak in this narration. The style of the writer is literally poor. The events of the novel are ridiculous, especially when he convinces the workers that they stand against people who steal them. They laugh until the enthusiastic sermon. And his imagination is very weak, even when he described the game Alzikula could have remained stronger than that, I do not understand any relationship of intelligence that you guess the location of the arrow .. Details of the novel is very trivial from the first grandfather who had hidden the image of his father and his mother without reason to limit Abu Mona who rejected him and agreed with others Then he agreed to him again in an hour, and of course the disappointing details that I reached for the book, such as that he is buying a paper and a pen for the man speaking to him about the book without any necessity, and then deciding to say about the man who inherited the book with his consent without any need .. two repeated words in an exaggerated length of the novel and a second guide As the writer is literally weak, they are the word Khaled, and I was surprised ... Give any page in the book protective Ra, the number of times he mentioned Khaled, and the number of times he surprised anyone. When I knew that the novel is talking about a village that deals in intelligence, I said that they are all very smart and they start to stupid one among them and respect their smartest and it is necessary to be smoked along what is in the city and not consider it stupid. But in this novel, intelligence was the same as that of the Egyptian pound, precisely any value, no respect, and there is no need for it to remain in his work ... especially because I am the first time that I know that when you think about your intelligence, it is said ... I am actually my intelligence, it was said and I read this novel.
I do not have a novel, I have no idea, no goal, no literary work
The reception crew needs to change. To be honest, nothing. Very weak and the reception lies to you. If he says we want to upgrade your room, know that they will put you in the dirtiest hotel room. This is their policy. I don&#39;t know why they keep the clean rooms twice. I live in this hotel and use this with me:
I liked it, and I liked it, it is sweet, so the style and style that reads it very much, because there are many words and events that could not be useful to write, even if it is only a novel.
Really trivial novel
His age. . The staff clearly weakened from reception to restaurant to cleaners
Staffing level needs revision. . An employee of carrying bags does not carry bags, he looks at you while you carry your bags and ascends them and does not help or even offer help In the past there was an employee at the entrance to the hotel, he opened the door for you and helped carry bags from the car to the reception, I asked for additional service, and I paid for it immediately, but Upon departure, they asked for the amount again, and asked to see the bill to make sure that I was paying badly at the staff level
Worst days in Jeddah Hilton. The room was entered even though I installed the Do Not Disturb sign, one of the employees entered my room and threw the Do Not Disturb sign on the floor. The reception was informed that he did not respect my privacy. The entire hotel
I hope you pay more attention. Proximity to the sanctuary. The breakfast buffet is modest
An unrepeatable experience. Room capacity and technical design used in the rooms. The hotel, despite the level of luxury and modernity, but you will not find service to keep pace with that where the human element there lacks the dedication and the spirit of welcoming. As I asked to change his work, and the receptionist refused to transfer the currency, as it is one of the very rare hotels that does not give you free internet, in addition to noticing that the room smells tend to rot due to what I think is the poor drainage of water from the toilet. Generally I do not recommend it nor will I repeat the experience of stay.
One of the worst books that I read is of no use, but it has brought Elias into my heart
The fastest solution of vomiting if you have gone out of your diet schedule and toothbrush has not been long enough; reading several pages of this narration and getting to know their pathetic characters, will be of great help.
Normal . there is nothing. Many apartments and workers are few to serve and there is only one elevator
I don&#39;t like it at all .. I have a sensitivity, as if someone has a high level, I love the novels, so do you let me imagine the needs, but the narrator de Habbetnich is in you with his imagination.
Criticism of the book, a summary of Ahmed Shawky&#39;s saying: And what is required is wishful thinking, but the world is taken as victory
Before I started reading it, I longed for a lot to start with, and as soon as I started until I found me quickly tired of the opposite of what is expected, despite this, it attracted me to continue reading it to the end, and as I am now, I never regret reading any book. :
What is this idiocy and this flattery? This is the extent that we have reached the idiot with foolishness, I had bet myself that I would not write a letter about this foolish story. Do not aspire to the status of a novel. But he managed to show one of the worst of us
Omar Taher is his entire life as a ball ... this is not nice for a girl to read his articles because girls basically don&#39;t like the ball:
Very weak. Too bad in terms of service, you need to sit three hours to respond.
Weak. . Overpriced price for poor services and hygiene
I do not deny that the novel attracted and liked me until I finished it in record time due to its excessive length, but the novel and the writer cannot stand up to any literary criticism, no matter how flattering gentle, the work is sloppy and literally poor to an incredible extent, perhaps my admiration for it returns To live with friends who have gone through many worlds of the story in a painful addictive journey.
I do not recommend this hotel. Only marine tank on site. Dealing is very bad. There are too many fallacies in the account until you make a complaint and then the situation is modified. Breakfast was calculated for the child even though I live in two rooms, and they did not provide two adjacent rooms even though I booked a month before I arrived, which resulted in my children staying with me. The internet is bad and when you tell them, they said easily, go down to the lobby. The many instructions in the hotel and the warnings bring you the feeling that you are in school. I never recommend this hotel. There are many hotels in the same location that respect the customers. There are wires on the balcony to expel the bathroom very dangerous on the eyes of children
Dr. Khawla was great at telling events, I did not like the end very much, I felt like it was just to please the reader, I would have liked it more real. Although the novel is a true story, but the injustice that happened to Rima in the half of the novel, made me boycott it for a whole day. I did not imagine this end of Rima .. Hassan&#39;s injustice also, and Ahmed&#39;s absence from the events. I did not feel at the moment that the novel was romantic, it tended to be more religious, it was Dr. Khula very frank in the presentation of the Islamic religion, a day of methods that attract more .. Also she showed the advantages of other religions, but I preferred Islam without notifying the reader why. The novel is good ..
Weak. . There are no cleaning services or a baggage factor available. There is only a worker at the hotel, and you have to wait slowly. Check-in and check-out procedures for the hotel. Breakfast is bad.
A group of texts are all together, I did not like much
Barman is a novel read by novelist Ashraf Al-Ashmawi. The novel&#39;s title tells you that it is about the bar, his characters, and the role of the barman or sommelier. But she is Talaat, she is one of the characters of the novel that does not revolve around him. The character of the sommelier and events at the bar did not convince me as a reader and he was unable to write it. In the auto club narration, it was on a few pages about the sommelier and the events of the bar, but as a reader I forgot it, I saw it in front of me. But here it faded. The rest of the events, personalities and style are very normal. Not on the level of Tuya and the guide disappointed me. The novel&#39;s music is beautiful. The cover is not what I liked, always Ahmad Murad. It was beautiful. This time I did not catch it. I wish the novel is the best.
The book has been read several times. I like Mark Twain&#39;s books
In the name of God ... From my day, I do not like the biography of the goblins and the jinn, but I would like to think about it if the subconscious judged us .. From your day a magician and a magician to the letters in my heart, I doubt your thoughts and beliefs .. Unfortunately if I mistook you, but. I believe when reading that my thoughts and acceptance of ideas are outside the boundaries of the book and the writer, so I don’t get stuck behind the intellectual torrents of everyone who donates and writes to write. I believed that the origin of the Egyptian pound is Moroccan, from their day they are malicious and you just run and bet. I support you as a star alone, but in fulfillment of your soul in the sky, Al-Qossabi has only one for you. God does not harm us, but protects us from all evil.
I grew up and forgot to forget, how can I criticize it while criticizing our true religion, the eternal religion, the religion of beauty, the religion of love, the religion of passion, the religion of science, the religion of work, I criticized everything beautiful in this religion ... The writer hints that Saqr did not understand religion properly, or that the writer herself does not know the religion with its beautiful meanings, does it criticize society in itself that does not understand the significance of religion or whether it does not reach its beauty ... Great criticisms in the novel made me ashamed of its readers at first but I I completed it to the end of a researcher, and with all failures, at the end of my satisfaction
Disappointment
How do I download the book from this program?
disappointing. Nothing to mention .. I do not expect it is a five-star hotel. The treatment is very bad. The rooms are not available. The service is not fast. I recommend that travelers who prefer five-star hotels do not go because they will actually be shocked.
Somewhat boring.
I do not know the reason that led Al-Bari to write it at this time .. I think he was in a hurry, and if he waited, until the picture became clear and the chaos disappeared a little bit, it would have been better. He tried to be neutral but was unsuccessful, and clearly expressed his sympathy for ISIS and justified its violence by previous examples in history ... he hinted about Saudi support for ISIS before the dismissal of Bandar bin Sultan, and this is something I did not understand. In addition, some information was not accurate
Don&#39;t waste your money unless you live to pop random random murmur starts in the morning around morning and continues through into the next morning. It is a very expensive place if you cannot sleep at night or napping during the day. Your room is directly on the bar area, so there is no escape, and after a day or something, you will want to escape. It&#39;s a shame because every bar on the beach is law-abiding and music stops at night at night so everyone can relax. But the Cuban team is a group of bad people who ignore the law and the comfort of the inmates.
Actually a stupid book like his name. Too trivial ... too superficial ....... looklock too empty. Of the most trivial and worst thing I have ever read: /
I don&#39;t like people who think logically. What would happen if the sky fell on us? Despite the theories, numbers and scientific evidence, the book did not interest me at all. I couldn&#39;t complete the book because I did not feel the benefit of gossip in hypotheses
I acquired the book at first without hesitation in the book fair, because of my admiration for a book I do say a word to the same writer, but unfortunately I did not like it, the writer in the introduction suggested that many said in his book I do say that the style and language were simplified and easy and this thing They did not like it, and I subconsciously expected the writer to make the method difficult ..... I only liked the second chapter, which is the prophets of the East.
Khayes Hotel, its beds are old, and the cyst is back. nothing. everything
As if the book is a nervous coffee debate.
Miserable hotel. I did not like anything. The reception is poor, the furniture in the rooms is old, and the breakfast is not good. The restaurant is not good. Nothing in the hotel deserves a mention. I advise against staying there
I will not repeat their residency. Just calm.
This is possible talk for your grandchildren in Qada Safa after Morocco .. I will never more than this .. The book is bad .. Really very bad.
A family hotel that does not allow visitors to enter. The hotel is quite good and the apartment is large and suitable for families or a group of people. The location of the hotel is far away, most of the taxi drivers do not know the location of the hotel, the health club is small and there is only one worker serving the club and the pool is not eating well, visitors are not allowed and the reason is a family hotel where this thing was not mentioned except on arrival they require you to register the information of everyone visiting you prison Mo Hotel
disappointing. Sea view. Delays in preparing the room and waiting an hour after the specified time
What I liked about the novel is its mystical spirit and exaggeration in the use of speech science.
disappointing. . I forgot things in the room, I was not contacted, and the phone numbers in the reservation or location are incorrect and I could not contact them
The book is wonderful, but it disappointed me .. The author says that he defends in this book Muhammad the human, peace and blessings of God be upon him, frankly, but the defense was more emotional than what was analytical. The writer does not display the other clearly, in addition to that he does not go too deep into the response, so he does not elaborate, as if you are listening to a program that lasts for minutes on a radio .. The paragraphs of Muhammad Al-Abed and the husband deserve three or four stars .. Note :. If I read the book a few years ago, I think my evaluation for it will be higher.
There is no false Wi-Fi, we are used to it, there is no connection, but no internet. Room size. The map, via the map program, does not indicate that the hotel is obsessive to you, and there is also no Arabic speaker
We will come out of the cave when you, my boss:
Too bad too. Just good reception. The room smell is poorly organized ... the lack of speed in responding to the request, the cleaning workers do not come on a daily basis, but you must ask them before the fourth hour to get you the role, very bad, bad, I do not advise anyone
To start with, I do not see the book as an anecdotal collection, and its texts are closer to blogging articles or blogging as they are called. This does not rule out the existence of some anecdotal texts that bear a sincere feeling, and I think this is what distinguishes the author most. However, the mixing of the style of blogging with the style of fictional writing led to something similar to water dilution, so the book became more lean. Does this mean that blogging weakens the language? This depends on the author&#39;s view of him. Among the writers is someone who respects writing in all cases and looks at blogs as channels for publication, so he writes faithfully what he writes in paper books. But many view it as a white card that allows the author to license everything and override the language on the pretext that these are not literary texts; these are notations. . I suffered in the book from abundant linguistic mistakes, mistakes everywhere and everything, even in the simplest of rules. I suspect that the reason is the weakness of the writer&#39;s language and the book&#39;s reviewers as well, as long as all these errors have gone under their noses without noticing. For example, how does a writer in Al-Fusha who like to say that one eyebrow is raised and does not feel stabs in his ears like? And, worse, how can he do this twice in the same book, separated by only a few pages; the same phrase with the same two errors? . This is a simple example, and the mistakes are not only in grammar, but in many linguistic and verbal methods. She says, for example, in a position: I put my leg under me and it is a very colloquial expression in the wrong’s way, so what is this from me that puts its leg under it? It is nice that Rehab writes in Arabic far from colloquially, while she originally studied it in English literature, meaning that she has something that might motivate her to write in English, but I would like her to be more jealous of the Arabic that she preferred.
The book is spontaneous and the tone of sadness in which it is very influential .. I liked the author’s accountability to himself and his expression of his desire to return to our Lord and regret his mistakes and his urgency to reach the right path even if he strayed from it at times .. The book in its entirety is good
disappointing. . A bed was requested as a King and this was done. We did not get the same request in the reservation. There were two beds combined with each other. The bed cover was separate. There were two. There was no cooperation with the crew, and I was delayed a lot.
This book makes me the hard atheist:. The book raises questions on the mind of the reader, while the author cannot literally respond to those questions that he posed. In addition to the misinterpretation of some hadiths and Quranic verses
Very weak. No, not comfortable. I wish the best
disappointing. . All rooms are not clean and there is no interest in that the furniture is old and not worth five stars
A nice place to relax but the distance is far. The breakfast was delicious, the view and the atmosphere are very nice. The cleanliness of the beds and the rooms were not clean.
I wished a lot to acquire this narration, especially after my reading of the wonderful chiropophobia, but it came spontaneously without expectations, and it was not at the level that I had hoped for .... I usually do not compare work and another, but here I am compelled to narrate such as cirophobia with its narration, language, and wonderful content to Aspect of feeling does not come after a narration such as a misfortune of Asfexia and far from expectations .... The language did not come strong and the style of narration made me lost, perhaps some of the events made me excited with it, but the general content was not as strong as the name of the novel besides the strange ending completely and completely away from The discount, if it had been left open, would have been better ... I might look tough, but Actually, I was hoping for the best after cervophobia and still waiting for the writer, Mohamed Naguib, the best, because I know he already has more ...
Alzheimer&#39;s short stories. The first literary book I read for Al-Qusaibi can finish reading within an hour or less. Simple sad stories are notes that Jacob Al-Arian writes for his wife while he lives in the Alzheimer&#39;s Department at Georgetown University. Reading the lines in some of the passages is what distinguishes this story, especially when he criticized some things, not to exceed the passages, because I did not fear the memory.
Very weak . Another annoying pickle. Inconvenience and discomfort
Translation is weak, feeling free. I found some beautiful phrases in the first chapter, and I did not find anything useful or interesting from the second chapter to the best.
Frankly, a hotel does not deserve two stars. Everything about this hotel is less than 3 stars. Everything there is an employee called a long Qalim at the reception lying in the eyes of your eye and all the hotel employees prefer foreigners over the Arabs and the price for the service is very very very expensive
Weak. . Adaptation was broken, I moved to another room, and it was bad
A fragile style story .. an unrealistic story in what she describes from feelings .. but I admit that the writer was raised to convey the hatred and hatred that Jumana, the foolish, deaf and blind, has to Abdul Aziz al-Muqarif, who does not belong to the human family.
I bought the novel based on the presentation of Al-Aswany behind and the fact that Al-Aswany greatly complimented the writer. The characters are incredibly stereotypical ... and the method is fabricated and boring ... politics and governance are interchangeable with events and the writer&#39;s method is an abyss method and not a writer&#39;s method of mastering his tools. The novel was written in haste, and the characters are shallow and shallow, especially the personality of Abdul Wahab. I felt that I had read it hundreds of times before. Unfortunately I bought the writer Barman and Time of Hyenas together, which will make me review myself before buying two novels of the writer himself in the first experience. Commercial novels have become more admired than novels that carry human or social dimensions, which is what needs a special topic to be discussed.
. Its location is quiet only. The internet is very bad, the breakfast is not enough, the price is straightforward, and the service is supposed to be less, since the hotel is a star
One of the worst hotels in Dubai. I liked what made me choose this hotel, the hotel decor and the bright rooms are comfortable. The rooms were very small and narrow, this I did not expect .. the air conditioning is very poor and there is no air conditioning for the rooms I could not smoke the doors are very annoying when opening and closing the menu is bad It was very high. The bathroom is very, very tight. There is no water to spray and wash. All people should be cared for. I am Muslim and I need washing. I cannot return to stay at this hotel for the reasons that I mentioned are very important to me.
Hotel was not up to standard. The place is close to the Prophet&#39;s Mosque only. Cleanliness is poor, lighting is poor, breakfast is cold and not fresh, for four days, no crib is provided. Room furniture is old, the smell of smoking fills the place, room and hallways. The room is not replaced.
I did not find Gibran here.
As much as I liked the dazzling darkness and country, the more my excitement and disgust at this novel.
A cover star and a star for Tamer Ibrahim, because it is impossible for Tamer Ibrahim to have a dark duo?
I was upset at the hotel for one night in June and two nights in July of this year. Problems the first time the bathroom did not have a rob. I called the reception. He tried me on another service line. After a quarter of an hour, I attended the lady with the robe and not the bathroom. The car went to the restaurant in the breakfast room. Being strangled with some in front of the customers, something unfortunate and happened. There is nothing wrong with it. The second time I called the reservation service to book I made it possible in Cairo around nine o&#39;clock at night. Hotel wa Z today .... I have not got the card only CM: Medhat Abdel-Hamid. A note I wrote in Arabic so that it would not be a bad reputation for everyone
As I read the book, I became afraid of saying the word I, do you think I grow old? In many situations without feeling or touching what I say, a creative writer with his words and description
Dr.. Salman Al-Awda is a wonderful speaker who does not hope to hear his speech, but as a writer I admit that I got bored in the middle of his books .. Thank you, enemies ,, a collection of articles on the differences and conflicts between people and the ways in which they deal with them, excellent for those who interact with others positively or negatively one of the axes of his life. .
Bad apartments. nothing. Everything, the showers were broken and the septic tank did not drain the water
A hotel below expectations, run by amateurs. The presence of a kitchenette with sweet. Sweet, very small
The food was cold and took a long time, and the Egyptian manager has a loud, annoying, and damaging atmosphere
The place is excellent but the staff are not respectful. The place is excellent, the rooms are excellent, and a large family is enough. The reception staff are not cooperating with the citizens or the Gulf and their style is very bad and they do not want to provide any dependency except for the money. So shameless that they say go out to a second hotel. When we got there, they were late for hours, so they gave us the room.
The restaurant is the best of its location, but its eating is not fresh, frozen and the lighting of the restaurant is very weak.
I was going to madness and read the book Men of Bulaq and Women from the First Faisal, after what I saw in the enthusiasm, I got lost, and I have many notes. In the introduction that does not classify as an introduction, he used to say that our middle class is represented .. I would not say that the middle class has remained less than now, but what is not heard about the one below the poverty line? Where are you from? The best need for writing is the cover of Karim Adam, and away from his blood, Ihab who is soaked in projections that deserve the trouble of concentration, The word of truth: I can consider the book as an alarm or a scout for many of us ... by opening important topics and speaking in more important details, but with less blood, we should conduct it when we read the book ... by opening brackets without what closes them, and see me. There are empty pages in the book that do not have any need, and we will not feel the melody of his words, which means wasting paper wealth. The content of a short story was mentioned by Chekhov Mengchi, this is the greatest Russian writer in Al-Nisbali ,, the most important thing is his Excellency, he says that the story hero lived his life looking for a rupee banknote ,, will you tell me where is the problem? . The problem is that the ignorance of its sovereignty is not known to the fact that Russia&#39;s currency is the ruble and that the rupee is the currency of India. The language that most of the people used is colloquial ,,, a lot of people who are interested in the book do not use it ,, knowing what is the type that forces you in the end that you say poison or work in a more correct sense .. The problem is not cold, ,, the problem is that it contains language references to the book ,,, I die And I know is see eh. It is clear that he has a problem in currencies. He tells you an Italian lira. What is he, but he has time difference and I don’t know that Italy has written the lira who has left the euro as its official currency. The most important sound effects are wrong, the last one is Tatata and its phone does not mean any sound exactly. Its end is a book that is all clichés, and Ihab Moawad does not know that it is classified as a writer unless the intended literal meaning of the word, and in accordance with the right of Hindawi I want to marry me in the first part was very complete. ,, And to repeat repeated words that do not have a new thought ..
Weak. . Very old hotel and old furnitures as well as the building and bad location inside lane, overpriced price. I regret that I lived in it.
Weak. . Expensive price for the services provided. Bad transportation and cleanliness
disappointing. Otherwise, only the breakfast is kind. Reception is bad
One by one .... First: between two and three stars. A star of the style ... fairly reasonable especially for the starters. And its star of the idea. What I thought was needed more crystallization ... Secondly:. This type of writing is considered a kind of messy writing. Who expresses the internal chaos of a person. Thus, normal and normal people will not feel any need, on the contrary. A question will come to their minds. What does that mean ????. The first work often remains a great reflection of the writer&#39;s own personality. I think that if she had some patience, the idea could have looked better ... I liked the idea of the psychological interpretation of the whole topic at the end. Waiting for more writer:
disappointing. . Entry and departure times
Bad and not suitable for families. Good place to stay close to services. Reception laboratories and served the rooms and staff, especially Sayed Al-Masry, exploiting the hotel residents
You did not incite me to complete it
I was very disappointed in this book .. I did not like it. I felt, while I was reading it, that Dr. Khaled Tawfiq&#39;s quiver had become empty and that he was going to translate from the naive American novels .. that we see in descending movies from Aspens .. I just enjoyed some medical terms besides the idea, no more.
Disappointing apartments in cleanliness and location. . Toilets, one is broken, and the other is bad in the flow of water, one of the toilets has been removed from it, the suction fan has not closed the hole, the length of stay that lasted for five days, and asking to change the room without responding to us.
Quite frankly
It did not take me soo one session to read it, a light book is OK, but when I read the title of the book, I thought that it talks about more important things, and that it has ways to renew marital life, and when I read it and found it completely different from my expectations .. His stories are as follows I think it is an ordinary and nothing new.
Weak. . Blinded
important . . The presence of the bar in front of the elevator, which makes me feel fear when I get to the room and face a drunkard
The book is closer to literary criticism of books and novelists. Almost the first two semesters are the best. But in general the book is less than my expectations
Depression and wasting time
Well ... the two stars of the second half of the second book. Frankly, that&#39;s half of the first book. It can&#39;t convince a child. Just as you cannot deal with riyals in Britain .. You cannot convince an atheist with a highly religious and mystical interpretation of Sufism and interpretations ... far from logic.
The hotel is deteriorating. . There are no non-smoking rooms, furniture and brushes are poor, and reception is very poor
They would bring me a quarter of a chicken and Roquefort cheese in the food and the same at dinner on Mondays Tuesday and Wednesday and in meat days they would bring me half a pound of kebab. Sometimes I used to eat live and cheese. As for the meat, most of it is meat and lard, and it contains one healthy piece of meat. They did not bring me any fruit from the day I entered until the day I went out and it was my wish to allow me to radio. And they helped me every day by answering my request. But I did not receive this promised radio despite the alliance and the faith that I was hearing in the evening. ..... and my name was da prison: /
If only he had written the homilies in a simple prose, he would have been better than the narrative style .. most of the stories contained unnecessary details and simple construction as if they were children&#39;s stories
A very superficial and meaningless novel ... Even the rhetorical analogies that the author tried to formulate are never wonderful and there is no linguistic beauty ..
I had previously read a book by Dr. Mohamed El-Arifi in the name of enjoying your life. And I think that he and this book guarantee the same content as the two books are a study of the book of Del Carnegie and inoculation of some of the verses of the Qur’an and hadiths. But Mohamed Al Areifi&#39;s book is characterized by a more attractive style. The book is good but not as expected
The novel of the blue or clumsy elephant is, so to describe it from a humble point of view, is a superficial narration that deserves only one star or a fracture of it full of holes, so to speak may give in the beginning a sense of mystery and depth, which is impossible to shock at the end of the narration from its surface and its emptiness. The end seemed like a sanitary drainage that the author blew up in our faces when I attributed everything to the jinn, superstition and sorcery, which was not expected or commensurate with the preparation and the level presented by the author from his logical and analysis in the beginning of the novel and its climax .... the novel smells of the smell of alcohol from among its lines to a hyper He singled out the author for his description and book, which was also exaggerated by his hints and descriptions, which amounted to banality. There are many vacuums left by the author in the story and not closed by what happened to Maya&#39;s character and how it happened and the talismans were neither tattooed on him nor him. Where was he for the past five years, and what did Yahya do ... five years, an extremely exaggerated number? Does Yahya live in a single-storey house with a garden and a neighbor to watch, or does he live in his building with a doorman? Numerous inconsistencies were found, but the writer had a good descriptive ability that conveyed the reader on the journeys of the acid and wall. . Precision makes you coexist with her and gets up with the hero and you feel the headache in your head from its impact. Overall I do not recommend it. Thanks
Bad novel .. obscene .. vulgar .. devoid of anything beautiful..the writer&#39;s style is a conversational style .. and its language is obscene .. and the subject of the novel exhumed in the rubbish of society .. and around it the events of the novel .. strange to meet in one novel all elements of bad I would only recommend it to my enemy to darken it, as you clouded me and disgusted it as you disgusted me
I do not recommend it unless you have to. Proximity to the campus and delivery service. The name of a hotel is not worthy of any star, there is never cleanliness, the room is very narrow, the bathroom is narrow
Although I am a big fan of Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq&#39;s writings, but also in person, the book does not present a new collection of articles included in a book, nothing more, nothing less .. Finally, what I liked most about the book is its last article, which is tan tan where the author writes In response to that, Tintin is the dagger of the Francophone culture, aimed at our chest:. In my opinion, she was passing through a loyal Egyptian candidate named Al-Ahram, where stories that are inappropriate for our culture are excluded, and I do not remember that any spy arrested was a reader of Tintin. . Notice the following and work on your mind. Remember that American values fill in the magazines of Mickey, Superman and Spiderman .. Remember that there is no parenting relationship between any of Mickey&#39;s heroes, and remember that Donald Duck does not stop trying to date Daisy the charming duckling ..
disappointing. The location is just perfect.
Dislike. The style is very dry
. The villa is beautiful, spacious and spacious, and the swimming pool is also beautiful. Entertainment is almost non-existent, there is no supermarket, and the buffet price is quite high
I had great enthusiasm to read this novel, especially after I heard about it from praise, but when I started reading I was bored and felt that the novel was exaggerated by its praise .. I could not complete it to know whether the author really touched on the history of Sudan and the struggle to prove self and establish a post-occupation state or is the whole novel based on The story of an expatriate and his fines .. One of the strengths of the novel may be its language, which I did not taste as I read it in English .. I may return to read it one day in Arabic to know whether it deserves the praise it met or not ..
The novel centered on an important fundamental point, which I see as the cause of many differences between husbands and lovers. It is the problem of frankness; that each side speaks to the other of its emotional past, and we forget that we humans do not forget. Those stories will remain in the hours of serenity, such as thorns that stroke our depths and disturb our beds and spoil us with a happy time or give our innocent words different meanings ... I was bored to use the word thorns that was repeated a lot, and I hated love I saw flimsy here as the hero said to himself: All his knowledge of the woman was from The papers .. Adhering to a beloved like that indicates a lack of maturity, no doubt .. It was the worst novel you can read on a ship sailing between the banks of the Nile .. I wanted to throw it in its waters
Whenever I entered a bookstore during the past two years, I found this novel in the best-selling business list, and I was never excited to buy it, even after I learned that it would be turned into a movie, and when I saw it on the shelf for the last time two days ago and found on its cover the edition I decided to buy it and finished it in two sessions Just .. The work in terms of technique is very good, the parallel cutting style, the gears and the escalation, all of these things the writer used smart and well. Technically, I think the work in my humble opinion is less than average, so trying to create a deep text for a flat idea came exactly like someone trying to carry a very bulky vehicle on a very weak chassis .. I respected very carefully the writer&#39;s accuracy and his devotion to drawing details and creating an attractive graceful dialogue It depended on the use of the vocabulary of Egyptian vernacular and many popular themes among the contemporary youth audience, which helped a lot in popularizing the novel and its audiences, especially with that intense dose of smart wrap around the idea of love, its essence and its meaning ... its torments, its pains, dreams and His romance and melancholy .. I enjoyed the novel as someone who enjoyed the slippers FH between meals ,, but I could not Osnfea as a literary work sober, or deep, and I can not put it on one rack with a giant business, despite their success and their popularity.
An interesting light novel, but it did not appeal to me very much .. I think that it took a wide reputation and a size larger than it deserved .. It touched on a strange and new topic that I liked about it .. only nothing but
A book that does not have any dimension in personalities, and there is no development or direct increase
Weak. . The hotel is not clean
The title of the book is interesting, the content is simple and very brief ... The beginning of the book is a failure, when he said that Mrs. Aisha was born in the fourth year of the mission, and ignored the narrations in Bukhari himself that contradict this hadith.
The worst hotel in my history. Unfortunately nothing. The location, the cleanliness was poor, and the presence of stains on the carpet.
Very weak. . Some rooms do not have windows and toilets are very bad. There is no glass around the bathtub. Water comes out on the bathroom floor and the floor is filled. As for the kitchen, there is an electric oven, but it is not allowed to use. As for the shampoo and soap, poor quality that does not fit in a star hotel and the cooling is very high. This hotel will not be repeated, God willing
Very weak. The reception staff were very friendly, like Fahd, who greeted us and provided us with a room. Kufi is not fast and expensive is a real sandwich dog
disappointing. Flat detailing. Lighting inconvenience, cleanliness, location, distance from services
Ahmed Al Shugairi is an excellent journalist, God willing .. and his book carries good ideas for reflection and meditation, but I was not convinced about it as a writer. I would have preferred to listen to his story in India in one of his episodes than in a book.
A beautiful book, but its writer is noticed by his noticeable prejudice against girls, so that children can hardly be criticized except in two parts of the book.
disappointing. There is no. Never call the phone all the time, and breakfast is not at five-star level
disappointing . . The bed is very wretched and the handle is poor
Low level of service and bad treatment. Not good reception. The rooms were not equipped immediately upon our arrival and we waited for hours until the bags arrived in the rooms. The chef treated very badly and caused some attendance, which led to a fight between him and one of the guests. The restaurant is very bad and very bad treatment for the Egyptians.
I liked the book. I wished that the writer talked about how to reduce road tension and such more, but I expected the book level to be greater than such. I liked an idea. Always wake up half an hour early and use this time to invent new ideas and call this time the time of ideas and without every idea that comes to mind and start to implement ideas that bring you closer to your goal
The maintenance work was very troublesome. . Furniture cleanliness was not on the satisfactory level
Miracle, I reached page number. Boring in a way that I can not describe. And may I want to make the final decision that I am a complement. Ibrahim Issa saw himself in the recent period. Actually, Khalani has missed a book for two months
I will not be staying this hotel in the future. The best thing about the horoscopes site. Air conditioning is poor. Brushes are not clean. I would never recommend it
A star for the cover and a star for the hair
Language and title are worst, but content is an attempt to communicate an idea and the idea may have arrived and has been traditional
Words of love exaggerated dipped in molasses and clay. A page expected more than this. Two stars for some of the Chosen One. : //. . /. . : //. . /. . : //. . /. . : //. . /.
Very bad . Nothing less than the level of services required to exaggerate very high prices. Bad in all respects
Bhahahahh .. If this outperformed ugliness and killed humanity .. It was. He outdid himself ... I can’t believe that there are people like this originally ..
This is the first book I read to Amin Maalouf ... I started enthusiastically .... I tried to read the book twice, but on two occasions the boredom stopped me with the fortieth page .... There .... I do not know if I wronged the book .. But in my humble opinion if not The writer can write something stimulating in forty pages, as this alone is a serious weakness. In any case, a third attempt on me is possible. I can bypass the forty page ... and give a better judgment next time ....
Interesting story and open end, the worst page in this novel is the last page, I did not like the end of the story at all.
Deira Tourist. . The hotel is very old-fashioned, there are no services, the foundation is old and totally worn out as only one star
. Ostensibly, the novel is divided into two parts. The first part of it is related to his father, mother, and illness, and the disease is the weak link from which the writer moves to the second part of the jinn and demons to the end of the multiple horror features that he set to attract everyone, and I see that this multiplication negatively affected the novel. In the first line that started the novel, a very simple problem appears that almost completely bled the novel out of its roots, which is the hero’s injury with Coro’s disease, due to the fact that the writer is not a specialist or only satisfied with the information available on this disease on Wikipedia until you find the text transmission from the site, And to avoid this loophole and put a weak possibility of suffering from this very rare disease that does not exist in Egypt, it is not by eating the flesh of his father’s body but by eating his father’s brain and that his father traveled to Guinea or let us say to Africa in general. The events pass to find the beginning of the transformation and the emergence of the second line of the novel, which is surprising, I find no justification in its existence from the ground, especially after having good lines for the direction of the first regardless of its gaps, but it is clear that there is consensus at the present time that the book does not achieve the highest sales Or fame, unless he belongs to the literature of horror or in other words, the current fashion of writing is the literature of horror, and I do not reduce these words from the literature of horror or the talented book in it, but I am a fan of it and if I see that this subject has psychological and social conclusions of our own as Egyptians. It is clear to what extent the writer has been affected by Western culture, especially in horror movies and series. I found a series. . He imposes himself on my mind with too much force. The point where the child put his hands in his ear and murmured with the melody of a song, I felt that it came out of me from a medium-rated horror movie. I find it inappropriate for our society or the social class to which the hero is supposed to be attributed. How many points in this part more than mentioned. .
A waste of time and not worth reading. It should be called a novel, Ya Mahasin, seashells
I simply love it beautiful
Hotel Appartments . The bathroom is dirty, the water is poor, and the service is calling. The service, bathrooms and company are not comfortable
I don’t know why I like this group. I don’t know what I want to say to the author, but I generally liked the story of Melody, even though it’s very bleak.
It is a very short page novel .. It is certainly disappointing after reading Tantooriya more than wonderful, but in general it is an entertaining novel that I did not feel the time while it was going on with ... It talks at the beginning about his security, which fears the sea from which he was stolen by her husband and whose son disappeared on one of His ships are not returned yet .. His security operates in the palace of the Sultan with neighbors and one wife who seized power after killing his brother .. He owns many slaves but the British interfere in his policy and establish a colony on his land ... Then comes the most entertaining part, which is the journey of Saeed Ibn His security .. who left the ship and left it, and had to reside in Alexandria, work as a porter, then lose a friend Mahmoud is in the Orabi revolution and leaves Alexandria to live with an Egyptian rural family and presents the suffering of the head of the family after the defeat and the English occupation .. Then he decides to return to his mother ... Here comes the third part of the novel .. The return of Said and the joy of his mother and then his rebellion and the joining of a friend Hafiz in drinking forbidden coffee By order of the Sultan until he ended up participating in the slave revolt against the Sultan, which ends just as the Orabi Revolution ended before with defeat .. The revolution ends with the martyrdom of Saeed and his mother stops fear of the sea ..
Unfortunately, my time was lost:
We hope to take care of the cleanliness of the hotel, the rooms, the restaurant and everything. Location. Room cleanliness
An unrepeatable experience. Breakfast fairly. My car was shocked in the parking of the hotel and everyone evaded responsibility despite the presence of cameras that annoyed you by calling and knocking on the door even at times of sleep.
Very weak. The location is in a very high place, it is difficult, despite the availability of transportation, but sometimes the police closes the entrance, so very tired. The services are very bad for them, especially in the restaurant. The waiter’s crew is very bad in the treatment. They make themselves work and clean the beds, and the sheets are not clean. I did not like anything
Weak. Too bad the furniture is too old.
disappointing. . Cleanliness and sounds are in place.
Hypocrisy or not hypocrisy .. Can life be straightforward without hypocrisy ... or does it have hypocrisy? I liked the movie more than the novel. The novel has a lot of useless stuffing ... and the idea is very clear, I mean, I did not like excessive nationalism in his words. An unfortunate experience with Sebai
The location of the hotel is acceptable, but I am not a clean hotel. . The rooms are not clean
Bad booked a room for non-smokers, but I was entered into a smokers&#39; room and the whole floor smelled of smoking and the room was very bad and smelled repulsive, I asked to change the room but none of their words. The room is very poorly lit, and the bidet has no place to hang, always on the floor, moistens the floor, and the shower escapes water from the edges of the glass partition on the bathroom floor. I asked to repair the bidet and perfume the room when I got out of the room from the time of the Maghrib call to prayer until we came back after the evening and we were surprised that nothing was done despite the presence of the official in front of the room door and we promised to do the necessary and he said with the letter Tact and great deal and Abdul Rahman was very good at the reception when I objected to the smell of the room. He tried his best to find me a replacement, but he did not find the same price unless I paid extra riyals per night ?????? The assumed hotel reputation is more important than the room value, with other hotels they did a free upgrade and other things
The era of monkeys .. Mustafa Mahmoud. ...... Another face of the writer ... and a bad book from my perspective. A living application of a man’s view of a woman as a way .. a bridge .. or even for the sake of humiliation that was thrown in the book it is possible to go down too to the level of contagion ... despite the abundant knowledge of the writer .. he sees the woman as a distraction from religion .. and sees her great virtue is Containing a man and turning a blind eye to his sins in her right, knowing that virtue de must be compulsory and not optional .. This was a deficiency saying that our Lord was created for the six minds in order to think of serving the man only. From his words, this also contains a horrible conclusion that can be found in the brain of any person, that this man does not think that a woman has an entity at all, not really just a thing. Just a bridge. He sees that all love is for God and any other love is a bad thing attached to the heart and must be left ... ... I benefited one thing but from this book ... that any person has very many aspects, no matter how great his thinking is, there is a defective side ... We are the ones who make sanctification for people .. I really mean ..
The beginning of the book was to tell famous stories in a special way, and from the point of view of the writer in which the bitter reality was reflected. As for the rest of the stories, they are indirect sighs and a gloomy struggle for venting from inside. A light but overburdened book of sighs may make you feel some pain.
I do not like luxury when they advise the patient to endure the pain of life .. I usually prefer to read to someone who tasted the bitterness of failure and was subjected to the hardships of life before he succeeded, but a person who is not tired of thinking about running after a livelihood barely blocks his saliva and then comes to offer free advice to people, so I consider it a kind of nonsense The literary .. Thank you, sir, the writer for your theoretical advice that did not bring anything new, whether on the practical level or even the literary ... What are the most human development books and advice that fill the market and what is the least benefit from them
Malpractice and services in the form of a hotel. Just looking. Bad experience by all standards, spoiled my graduation ceremony and canceled my reservation, and after they complained to Bukking, they remedied the renewal of the reservation, but after they raised the price and canceled the breakfast, I insisted on taking my right and called again to the Bukking who solved the problem, but after the hotel delayed me about three hours in the lobby, their manager laughs and says I did not receive an email knowing that it does not take several seconds. The disregard of the nerves of the inmates. There is no parking space in front of the hotel. I said the usual supplies like brush and putty, and so they brought a brush and putty only, no soap, shampoo, or bathroom shoes that do not deserve the name of a hotel as well as the stars. Bad by all standards, please book here.
Very beautiful, but the writer is confused and confused me together. There is a lot of it in it, and sometimes I used to take a truce to absorb it .. I wanted the Granada trilogy and Faraj to be more honest
It is not unemployment ... but it is not a novel ... I have all saved it in the metro
I was encouraged to read this novel that she ran for the Booker. But half of a smile stuck to my face when I read it. Were it not for the language, I would not have given it a star. It is not up to the level of competition. A mere repetition of all the cries in superficial novels, as usual justification for betrayal, self-flagellation and marginalization of everything beautiful in society.
I am not thinking of staying again. . There is no car park, old room chairs are uncomfortable, there is no reception staff, no package in the customer, reservation of the ID card, despite the payment of the accommodation amount
The whole book is a sentence disliked by all pages .. There is nothing new or a new idea .. It is based on assumption and imagination.
About a month ago, I read a novel by George Orwell on prison literature ... And since prison owners fall within the same topic, it is necessary to point out the vast differences between Arab and foreign writers, despite the differing circumstances of the two versions .. Arabic novels rely mainly on language, unlike foreign novels that despite She lost a lot of her language during translation, but she retains her value due to her reliance on the idea before the language .. That is why our Arab writers often do not reach the world, no matter how well their novels became famous because of their lack of idea .. Ayman Al-Atoom in this novel depleted all his energies in the language of the novel to the extent that the novel turned to Khawat Group A poetic t, as if it is not a novel about a prisoner, but a romantic novel .. Language despite its beauty killed the novel .. The author exaggerated telling the details of personalities and prisons to the point of boredom It was a good start, but through the passage of pages and the recurring description of the characters and the events of his life in prison, the novel became very very boring after the middle .. I intercede for her only that she considers a biography of the writer who was imprisoned for his poems, and therefore the content is real .. Ayman al-Atoum apologized, but I never enjoyed reading it despite the many quotes from her .. I was making an effort to end it and get rid of it ... and because I totally refuse to kill literary works and leave them in the middle I had to get past some p I popped from them to the end, which did not affect my reading of the novel at all because it lacked events and limited them to description and repetition .. This is something I rarely do but it is better than leaving it pending .. Despite everything, it must be noted that the language of the novel is wonderful in the full sense of the word and I have never read a novel with this Rhetoric and style .. two and a half stars.
I would not recommend anyone to the hotel. Nothing but the site. Air conditioning is poor. Services are not good. Delays in entering and leaving the hotel. Insects in the room. Value for money and stars. Never match the hotel.
The book is a separate article on the biography of the Apes era. Most of them are acceptable and I didn&#39;t enjoy them. The writer&#39;s opinions formulate it in the same way. I continued reading the book until I found that article. Wow, and unfortunately, I did not find it. In the end, it is the writer&#39;s opinions that cannot be disputed, and at the same time I could not enjoy reading it
Forget the review that I had been writing before, very sincere. After I saw the advertisement of the movie that I was eagerly awaiting, I began to feel that this novel is a kind of literary precipice, so to speak. A fast rhythm, which you discover later, is super fast. An attractive idea, after which you discover that it is disgusting, and two thirds of the idea is taken from a foreign movie. This is nothing but talk about the famous hallucinogenic drug, which I will not tell its name to which people think that it is not a hallucinogenic drug, but it is your gateway to the other world, and that my prayers are very important. I repeat, Professor Ahmad Murad. Take care to choose your novel ideas. He lies who says that you lack talent or intelligence, but he believes those who say you lack wisdom in choosing the ideas of your novels. However, your use of the vernacular is not rational at all. Decrease colloquials slightly. Reduce the insults, a little less than the world May God guide us and guide you, teacher
First, it is a satirical act unlike my other texts, a satirical and sad work that employs the report&#39;s form and tries to make it an artistic form. In each of the twelve reports included in the book, a woman is called R, a personality is different in her circumstances, she is a mother of ten children at one time and one child at one time, a researcher here and a simple employee there ... etc., but she is always behind, because the characters complete with their reports a testimony about a moment in time Sad, surprising and ironic. All the writings of the book, including those of me, Radwa, are also shared by its various circumstances in sensitivity and alienation from a surprising, ridiculous and sad reality. The publisher wanted to call it a fictional set, because I said it was not a novel. In fact, they are separate texts that complement each other. It is, however, despite the relative critical silence, an experience I love. . This is what Dr. Radwa said about her book Mrs. R&#39;s reports. Radwa Ashour is Radwa Ashour, concerned with politics, enchanted with literature, preoccupied with history and identity, and in these reports specially add her writings with a pleasant caress that sometimes accompanies you with a pure smile on your apartment while moving between her reports .. Dr. Radwa goes and comes through her book The reports of the woman behind smoothly and smoothly, she travels From Africa, America and Europe, as you move through the times with remarkable lightness, and it does not give you the opportunity to marvel, but rather your exchange, informative and justified, I hope the reader will not be confused, because writing in modernity allows for a time shift, so the writer, especially in the first reports, is present with her scientific, cognitive and real weight .. three Only. They are only three reports who insisted on clinging to my mind after finishing a page book. Do you not notice that it is a strange coincidence that the number of pages of the book in the model of the vehicle of Mrs. Ra Fiora / Victory come from a small size in about three hours or more than about half an hour, except The three reports for reasons that did not attract me .. In Mrs. R’s reports on Cambridge with two domains, the academic professor with the attendant childhood presence of Mrs. R will prevail over all phases of Radwa, and while you find her sympathizing with the empire that the sun set off on and where the first Cambridge is located, you will find that she does not care about the country of Cambridge The second one Always repeat with her Iraq and Palestine and other matters ... The mother is reflected in the sad report, sparking the struggle of generations, while Radwa Tamim expressed her admiration for Jamila Boubacha, defending her and the beauty of the Algerian revolution, answering her is your generation ...?, The same generation that expelled the French once again Other, the million martyrs multiplied .. Then .. Then the funeral, and what a report, O Radwa, that the head was exhausted from the many questions and inquiries that I did not know about the kings of our bright bright people .. Kings are from the deaths of Gregorian and noble understanding .. I betrayed them, because I have not yet documented the events and their backgrounds, even though I have not even complained about my satisfaction On Arabic Wikipedia. Oh Radwa, what you welcome with us, and we have no knowledge of it
.Com.com is a photographer, and the story is less than utopian but fun.
Unfortunately, it was an uncomfortable stay. The food is varied close to the Prophet’s Mosque, but at the same time, it is far from the women’s door. There are several things that bother us during the two-day stay old. The water was cold for a long time and when swimming the water leaked on the ground. When requesting to change the room, they said that all the rooms were the same as the treatment of the crew was inappropriate except for the reception. For the first time someone spoke to me nervously on the phone because I checked the shuffle of the buffet. Average cleanliness, there is no food menu in the room, and when requested and contacted to ask for entrees, they said a minute to those who contacted us, so they would refer us to the pick restaurant. We did not get a response. We put a sign of cleaning the rooms from the morning and we returned back and nothing is arranged.
A sweet idea book, of course, but the way to present the idea was not at the required level. It was a lengthy and a lot of talk away from the main goal of the book. Two stars are enough
Weak hotel. Breakfast is good, dinner and food ok, but there are other downsides, I think that there is a problem with management in this hotel, because the hotel is well placed, and the high issue is solved by delivery cars, but I want management. First of all, the location of the hotel is high. There is a delivery car below the high, but the drivers are not respected. Sometimes we do not exist. Something strange happened to me, where I cut off the water before the call to prayer, even after midnight. The reception is not there.
Unfortunately, a peace viewpoint. Unfortunately when I watched the movie, I expected an attack on Islam for accusation of violence or terrorism, but after watching it, I discovered that the film is trying to make it to discover freedom within the girl in the Arab and Islamic society. The movie has very disgusting scenes for the two female protagonists in moments of abnormal love between them, and then comes their feeling of euphoria and happiness, as if these forbidden acts are their way to inner peace and a feeling of emptying which they suffer from. The film did not damage any of the religious aspects or even the Islamic customs of the girls ’family. Rather, it was sufficient for scenes of the religious cousin who also suffers from repression and the desires buried inside him, even though the film is Iranian, and I believe that his representation was in a western country, but I blame his creators for their tendency to travel and degradation. And distorting the image of the Muslim girl, even if she is a Shiite sect, as if these abnormal acts are the way to reach happiness and complete freedom. Watching.
Weak. nothing. Receptionist is very bad
I wanted to move away from Kafka and Fernando a little, and I said, &#39;God, we change the atmosphere and entertaining with the masterpiece Hogan ... sterile language, sterile conversations, a very trivial story, the usual clichy with romantic stories, but I mean, the writer laughed at himself and answered the idea of the genie, and a seat composed of his head, admonish On Goodyards because he put this thing called Hogan and admitted it was a novel. I looked for anything beautiful in it, nothing at all, not logical with every line, did a donkey, not a genie, and Sawsan black God, her face is of no use .... whoever wants to block himself from the books read this thing ....
The book in general is beautiful and reflects the psyche of the writer without entering into the details of his journey nor the reasons for his reaching faith and does not show how to be certain of religion. All the writer did was convey his reflections and feelings, but I do not blame the writer for this, because in his era there was not as much knowledge in the world as there was enough ability to understand it in Egypt at that time. May God have mercy on him and reward him for his diligence
A superficial novel, with no significant suspense factor ... The plot is taken entirely from the writings of history, with no major imaginary modification other than the characters chosen to play the roles of the story. Dialogue is stubborn, and it is all events; that is, no actual events take place. There is no exciting link between what is happening in the past and present of the novel .. What I appreciate for the writer, is his inclusion of ancient Islamic history in a police novel, as someone who expresses previous efforts .. A thankful endeavor, but I do not think it is enough.
Failed hotel in the full sense of the word ... . Failed and alternate director .. Maliki knows understanding and by raising his voice on the inmate frankly he deserves to be in the backstairs securty .. the top of the glory and the vocal sound.
Duplicate stories
A very typical novel .. Its events were faded in films and series. The two stars were countries, because on two pages, they were as good as the novel, but the rest is normal and traditional ..
To be honest, the story that makes me feel a sense of a monster while I read it .. I do not want to complete it. The novel contains a full of commercial signs and notices, especially for the names of alcohol .. With the utmost sincerity, I tried such a time once I completed it, but I would know its end, but I lost my enthusiasm before I came to the text
I think the last part of his life after Hajar was the important thing to write. In general, he would tell a story like more than a life experience
Bad . Very CN place. Deception
Five stars. The site is beautiful. nothing
From the worst of what I read ...
I could not complete it. I never loved it
It is very negative and has no ingredients, and it slows down the charging process
What is this obedience that I metaphorically called its book: What is this shit that I lost all of this time to read: Muhammad Sadiq is walking on line His approval remained for a few hours one day, and I wanted you to do it like that. I just want to advise him about the need for lack of literature and obscene revelations. Many books on the pavement. In your books, you will disappear, as we benefit from any need from the story of Yosra and Bahr To me in the book, there is no need, I mean, it is very clear that you stuck it in the novel for marketing purposes. I don&#39;t want more than this to mess up stories and cut up the names, but this is not all characters. She is also a violin
Will not be returned. . Bad staff
I wished that the writer touched on the humanitarian and psychological aspect of Al-Qusaibi instead of the great focus on the political and professional aspect
One of my wrong choices:
Doubt . Suspicion. Not sure. Anonymous . Suspicion. Suspicion. wear . Thought. This is what you&#39;ll see in. Thorns. And this is how love is if you are neither confident nor from you. Doubt. And the. thorns. But .. isn&#39;t reality really full of it?
disappointing. . The hotel does not rise to be five-star.
The first thing that came to my mind was a word whose strange beginning began with an ending. I liked it. I had long regrets. I really did not want to read something to Muhammad Al-Mansi after this fading in the words.
Acceptable and do not recommend it. Its proximity to the Prophet&#39;s Mosque. The bathrooms of the rooms do not have suction fans, which leads to the spread of unpleasant regulations in the hotel and poor ventilation, adding insult to injury
Very weak. . The rooms are small, the bathroom is small, the smell in the elevator and corridors is unpleasant
Despite some valuable information, the book does not live up to the aspiration of the reader who wants more about Ottoman history, as well as the topics of the book are not connected and it suffices with some positive outlooks on the Ottomans with what appears to be an objective and propaganda appearance, in general the book is suitable for a brief view
One of the worst books of Omar Taher. A star, even if less than a star, is also a star
Another book is very bad for the safety of Moses. I do not recommend reading why. I don&#39;t know how to be described as an outspoken thinker. I think the reason for his fame is that something out of the ordinary in his time is nothing but because by many measures he is very weak on all levels. A book about a few dozen thinkers, as he said, you can find nothing more than a biography that is useless, and his opinions are crammed inside this biography, most of which are stupid and frank. I don&#39;t usually stigmatize a person like this, but I totally deserve it. He suffers from advanced paranoia and terribly complicated his knot, to the point that he said my country is Europe. A strange attack campaign on all that is eastern, reverence for all that is western, strange. I prefer the West, but I will not attribute to them all its goodness and stigmatize the East with all its shortcomings. Its end is a sentence that he said about Goethe. Our perceptions and knowledge are much better and more than him. So, I would like to tell our thoughts and acquaintances that we are now much more than you, but you did not provide neither knowledge nor thought and the way of life to remain or follow people, so I congratulate you in your country, Europe and your broad culture, as I called it, which did not add to anyone, including yourself, anything.
good . nothing. The hotel is dismal, adding to the inconvenience of racing cars
A poor quality hotel in Dubai . Room cleanliness is bad, annoying to guests, custom service is very bad, staff style is not served. Guests: Hotel policy is to defraud and defraud all guests
Glad that I finally got rid of this sticky novel. If we speak in an artistic and literary manner, then this novel uses the same old trick, that the means take the place of the end, or more precisely, the end is used as a mask to use the means. It uses a mask of criticism of the disadvantages of a certain group of society, in a very limited context, to plunge pages obscene and obscene and low to describe the camera very vulgar. This is not the first time that his servant did uncle the same thing, but he added more than adultery, for example, that his method overwhelmed the purpose crudely .. Language was not good in most cases, many common words and common errors and grammatical errors and innumerable typographical. On the narration side, there is a very boring repetition of sentences and syllables almost as they are, the writer revolves in swirling and returns to what he said before. In terms of construction, the writer’s implementation of the temporal movement method came bad and instead of the pieces being integrated to complete the image accumulating on top of each other at many times .. Personally, I do not recommend reading it except for those who can resist nausea due to the obscene description and want to learn a set of disadvantages of the novel that met More here than I met in Chicago and Yacoubian architecture.
disappointing. Its location is close to everything. Too bad services
Khayas. I did not like anything at all. The room smells like you with urine dignity, the space is narrow, and the photos differ from the reality. The place is clear on it is old. An experience that will not be repeated
I did not like some of his views in some of the parts discussed. But I benefited from a few points as well and I liked the very end:
Weak. . A delay in the procedures for entering the hotel despite my presence at the evening
Weak. . The design is bad and the place is not clean
I do not recommend it. There is no. Financial exploitation in providing services that greatly exaggerate prices in terms of food, beverages, or internet service, is mortgaging your passport until you leave or paying the amount of real riyals. Dealing is bad. The food menu prices are very exaggerated, as if you are talking about star hotel prices in general.
The question that has been kept in mind since the beginning of the novel is why are all the people of this novel bad, lonely, fallen, and far from the simple Syrian citizen, who is proud of everything he represents, from land, lineage, work, and effort that he exerts in his land and what belongs to him. Why is this unjustified depiction of Aleppo glory, originality, history, art and flowers as a focus of sex, homosexuality and sin? The writer succeeded in terms of narration and failed miserably to turn this wonderful narration into a full novel containing a topic worth writing. Writer&#39;s combinations are delicious, but has literature of our time needing sex as a permanent partner to succeed? Did Khaled Khalifeh not be able to steer clear of this unjustified verbiage and seek from him with simple hints or just insinuations, the reader will understand the intended meaning ... two stars no more than one for the aesthetic narration and the second for the writer’s beautiful language at times away from its sexual content.
In the beginning, I did not fit into the book a lot. The book has a lot of stories and tips to link your subconscious mind with what you want and how you can solve many of the problems that face you. .
It was very disappointing and hard ... because I read all these articles before:. I was excited about a new book and a book I read came out
An unrepeatable experience. Location. The room cleaning service is bad, the inconvenience of the opposite room is constantly reported, the hotel management has been notified and nothing happened, the pillows are uncomfortable, the level of hygiene is low, there is a smell in the corridors that may be from the brushes, you will not repeat the experience and housing the hotel again.
Diary of a failed youth, pinning his failure on family, society and the city
A light book with an increase in ability to complete it
Turn off. Its beautiful language, romantic, makes you smile and sighs while reading. Then, events begin, romantic evaporation and beautiful words are lost in the mentality of an oriental man who justifies himself, selfishness and cowardice.
The story is good, but the treatment was spoiled by the novel. There are many boring places, but they are not generally the worst
The ancient Islamic / Jewish conflict in Yemen through a love story that combines a Jew and his Muslim. The deepest focus was on some details of the difference. He represented Muslims&#39; view of Jews as a source of crime and moral decay. And the low status in which Jews live. I expected the book to be more beautiful than this
This universe is spacious and wonderful, but we bury ourselves in our skins, our eyes are blinded to true bliss and true joy.
The road is long without end .. Minds must join hands to light it and discover it .. What we know is little ... and there is a lot of ignorance that has no limit..and a person is an enemy of what he does not know .. and for this he does not try to understand .. and closes every door from which light enters stupidity and fanaticism ... but the truth is greater than monopolizing it by one mind, or one doctrine ... and life is above all doctrines, because it is the root of all of them ... but fanaticism blocks the way for every mind that tries to strive, and withholds the terms that come from the great fountain that Inexhaustible from life ... And when doctrines control life ... life freezes, stops and dies ... Surprise dies .. Curiosity dies, imagination and innovation die ... Ecstasy dies etc. A slave that the unknown sends, and life turns into rules and laws that they call science..and it is not from knowledge in anything .. science is open arms with all facts .. science is not free from discussing delusion, delirium and superstition .. because knowledge is not limited to its law, and humility created it .. mind The irrational is not afraid ... and the will does not know the impossible ... many will see in some of what I have narrated in my stories myths why do we not try to understand together, rather than despise what we do not know, and say about it myths ... that the truth is closer to us than basil, That we put under our windows, if we try to understand .. it is under our noses, but we can use our noses according to traditions that have been set for us before .. Why do not we try to smell in freedom .. Why do we not look at the innocence of the child, to see things in her amazing grandmother, and to see the phenomena pulsating, suggesting thousands of facts ... I have nothing to add to the unseen amateurs .. What I have said. My ability has reached its end. All I have is to refer to the truth ... I refer to it with broken arms ... A life that ends in death, and there is no survival after it, is a life that does not deserve to live .. It is not our life. Our life is greater than ending in worms and dirt. The holiness that characterizes life at its core denies this tragic end .. Has any of you thought of himself .. This soul that was formulated from delirium, dreams and visions .. The most beautiful thing brought out to us by human civilization, has begun a dream .. all that is based on The land of cities, towers, factories, and temples began a dream, delirium, drawings and lines drawn from the void .. began to waste in the mind ... From the pulse of imagination, the world arose .... the password is here ... inside our souls ... if we think about ourselves, To our horror more than all sorts of magic .. But we are proceeding in a journey of a lifetime, and our eyes are turned outward .. We do not look back .. We do not stop to ask .. We do not meditate .. We seek the Secrets, secrets in us..and we are looking for magic..and we are magic..and we are waiting for a miracle, and we are a miracle ... how can this soul become a handful of dirt, and it ends up to nothing .... we do not die..we contemplate among us Past and present, and we see the flow of time from the perspective of eternity ... to die there not after life, but life ... and there is no point in the moving universe ... everyone moves in an endless cycle of eternity ... as the butterflies come out of the cocoons ... as The green peduncles come out of the grains of wheat buried four thousand years ... We also go out from life, to life, in eternal continuity ... I say this to those who come after me ... and I say to those who ask me about the average age of a person ... To infinity. ................... An invitation to exit the coffin
Very old, non-refurbished building. The lobby and restaurant. An old building, the reception is not good, the parking areas do not have an entrance to the hotel, the room is rudimentary, the channels in the list are virtually non-existent, and the receptionist does not answer the phone.
What I like about old books is the weirdness of their ideas and with Orwell&#39;s great style the book was fun. My problem with the book is that it is a collection of articles on very different topics, one of which is why I write not all topics have liked me. For the first time, I trade and delete complete topics from a book I read
The worst experience. nothing. The Arab discotheque asked me dirhams for entry
The reader has the option to either read your loved one more than he should or forgive, so the text will repeat it for the first narration, even if the speaker is dear and not free, but this does not prevent that the novel is good and the language is light and interesting and interesting and its ability to attract the attention of the reader is strong that can lift you to the sky and then take you to the ground in lines that may have been It was this defense that made me want to read, so forgive without hesitation, and I also wanted to read what a dear feeling would look like
Attractive title for miserable and empty content .. A novel marketed on the basis that it is political tells the story of the suffering of the Syrian people in a particular era, but the reader is surprised that it is far from politics and if there is a need to address this issue then the writer summarizes it in two words: the party and the president. In this novel, we find all forms of family degeneration, moral degeneration, absolute pornography, disgusting anomaly and extremism ... I wonder how a novel with this content can obtain the Naguib Mahfouz Prize for Literature and be nominated for the Booker Prize
The endless stories of my stories always provoke me .. The end provoked me and the story hurt me .. Oh how much it provokes the weakness of Jumanah&#39;s naivety, my dear tyranny and cowardice, although I did not listen enough enough from the beginning, but I was craving the end of this story to cure the mistake and unfortunately I could not deny it It was left in the slightest effect, but it is not enough. The language of the author is beautiful
I don&#39;t like relationships in the novel. It was too close:
I read to Abdul Rahman Munif when we left the bridge and it was very dry..feel as if he was throwing words on your face without mercy..what I read in a story of magical love seems different..Men turn to beings we do not know when they talk about love. The novel raises many questions that appear forbidden in public .. That kind of questions that suspends you between doubt and certainty swing you back a slow lake. I found it beautifully contemplative. I can say that I enjoyed reading it
Weak. . The service is uncivilized and decent
Weak. Location and view. Failure to clean rooms and beds is totally uncomfortable
disappointing. . Restaurant services, food quality in the menu, delay in implementing services, poor internet
Very weak. The buffet. Liars, give me the room without Wi-Fi, and when I called, they said an artistic malfunction and I complained to them about the poking
May my evaluation be difficult. But the biggest losses are when you read a book and in the end. Do not look for anything from him. Not even feeling enjoyable at the time of reading. My loss remains greater than the writer. He wants to say something. A message he wants to deliver to a specific person. But unfortunately. I expected to find more depth than this. It is not just words written and salvation. Unfortunately disappointed me
Perhaps I was excited about reading this book. I read about it if you wanted to know the reasons for the Egyptian revolution. Read the book .. Indeed, I felt the Egyptian people, and I sensed their suffering, and the author agreed to transfer the image simply without cost. The only problem I encountered was reading in the Egyptian dialect, as I heard it was much easier to read than read:
I bought the book based on reviews. Unfortunately, I was shocked, I did not like the dialogues, and I found some thinness. In short, I felt like reading a green forest story
A book about the beliefs and concept of colors in the Middle Ages. A lot in trifles, hallucinations and hallucinations
disappointing. I liked the Kaaba view. I did not like the window, the glass overlooking the movement and the Kaaba was very dirty and the vision through it was so that there was no toothpaste and the toilet was tight
/ Does not concern permanent clients. The site is a cleaning worker. Inconvenience odors in hallways Utilities prices are very expensive
disappointing. The capacity of the hotel and the availability of a good number of the hotel&#39;s concierge have great potential and they can compete if I know better. Busy reception staff are poorly cleaned to the corridors, to the point that all of the remaining rooms remain at the door for a long time. Bus service needs more follow-up and supervision. Lack of open buffet at lunch.
The book is not for ordinary readers like myself .. It is intended for those working in Arabic literature and followed by those interested in Arabic poetry in general .. I am not a fan of poetry and also I am an ordinary reader and I am not a student of literature .. Therefore, the book is no longer of any benefit from all the information mentioned ... I did not attend the verses of poetry very much and in many cases I skipped it ... The problem of the validity or the incorrectness of the pre-Islamic poetic texts did not interest me in anything .. In the end I think the lesson from any literary work is the extent of its quality only regardless of its author. ..But the good in the book is the methodical method followed by Taha Hussein to learn the proportions of literary texts ... even with no-oh By the way, I had the feeling that he was right because of his logical way of presenting ideas .... I give the book only two stars as a regular reader and I never judge him as a scholar or specialist.
A book suitable for novice reading or young people. The general year is well suited for an Arabic movie or TV series.
I have finished the novel Al-Muhaimid Al-Hamam to not fly in Buraidah and my opinion is that it is a boring novel and its content is frequently repeated in Saudi literature ... I will go beyond my reservation on some of the content of the novel because I see that talking on this point is a waste of time because we talked about it a lot ... The problem is that Al-Muhaimid presented a similar narration which is The bottle, but the difference is in the gender of the hero, otherwise there is nothing new.
A book containing lines of prose and thoughts of a dreamy, loving life. Light and gentle
I had great expectations about this book and I had thoughts of it being a book. Poor in view of the slowness of the extracts that opponents of the experience of Egyptian national liberation and comprehensive Egyptian development in the Nasserite period quote .. Although the man is not a liberal and does not radically oppose the regime of leader Gamal Abdel Nasser, on the contrary, he defends his basic points and articulated achievements, but both criticism and points The defense of the Nasserite experience, but it is extremely loose and lacking historical roots and philosophical support. The word is not more than rhetoric. Just opinions, visions and wisdom that do not reveal a philosophy or documentation of events or a philosophy of decisions even ... I do not recommend reading it, as speaking about the experience of the Egyptian people in the fifties and sixties, there are closer, better and more rational references for talking against or with that experience ...
A beautiful book at its beginning, then the writer turns to recounting historical facts with weak sources and mentioned some statements that even the writer himself is not sure of its authenticity.
Sexual references have no interest or need, insignificant discussions and conversations that have no importance. This book is perhaps the worst book I have read by Ghazi Al-Qossabi, may God have mercy on him.
Song.
As usual, she writes about stubbornness
Albilsan detention center. nothing. The worst entertainment trip ever .. There is no recreational activity
disappointing. . The price is very, very, very, very expensive, in terms of the star hotel, location and services
The first time in my life I read a page novel and it remains boring and in the end a bad novel from all directions. I don&#39;t know the review, a little long, but to burn my blood from wasting my time in the novel. First: They talk about the Sadat period, the high prices, the peace and openness treaty, and sectarian strife represented by an employee who takes money in order to inform the workers of the company to receive Sadat and his guests. All this is fine. We are also annoyed by the terms of the peace treaty and visiting Jerusalem, but what burns my blood is that most of the novelists are supporters who work as novels and look On the misfortune of Sadat’s period, and no one in two articles does anything about any need for the Nasiriyah period, which is repression, forgery, ending democracy, purely misleading media, the loss of Sinai, and other needs .... It means what was written in the novel on state security and that the corrupt hero of the novel was caught in January Lissa intifada forces means the repression Mafeesh good story of one of the first told by grep Khamis and executed for her Gaahahaddat Kamshish Tjapelln. Ok the workers are looking for money that is not well known. I am not aware of Za’al Abdel Nasser, so I want a full reception when he came back from Bandung. Ok, we talked about the Socialist Union and the pioneer organization and their role… Many other needs, but the Nazarenists see corrupt needs during the era of Sadat. And corruption during the era of Nasser works from which myths are not novel. Second: Every bit in the novel, the hero speaks to himself and discharges, so he says the words of where he went, and God, and how he guided us to his paradise, so how did he abandon us? Then he says an idiot, I mean repent, and I am not convinced that I will tell himself ... Words he meant and I do not want to say what I do not know. And a little owner says to the hero, it is necessary to marry, you will work as a fighter Lenin, I will marry, and we will go far, why Abdel Nasser is married, and the Prophet Muhammad hit the record. What is the matter? We will see the messenger need shit. Third: Every cam page is narrated in the cam line of a story and no click, I do not understand the required talent and do not understand what I want to say. It was possible to perform two stars because of the manifestations of corruption in the life that he said during the era of Sadat. Indeed, they existed, but for the reasons I mentioned last, the last star, and there was no zero.
It has good needs, and his mind is honestly sweet. But it contains things that are not honest, and their suggestions are not sweet. Also, the needs that I know are repeated by Al-Faida, and it is not clear what is Al-Faida?
I do not wish to return to him at all. Location only. The furniture is old, air-conditioned, hot, unclean
Canned rule. This makes you give him two stars, one because I dislike it, and the second because it is a judgment, and the judgment is always supposed to be good
The book that I read just before this book is Egypt’s book between the Islamic state and the secular state, and it is a debate about Islamic and secular thought. The Islamic team represents Sheikh Muhammad Al-Ghazali and the secular team Faraj Fouda. In the debate, Faraj Fouda’s answers were few and in my opinion they need clarification, so I touched on another book which is this The book in order to see his idea separately and judge it objectively with the logic I heard and read and not only heard ... It is worth noting that I did not find any insult or appeal against religion, but I found an appeal in the companions questioning the belief ... So what are you waiting for more than that? The book explains the truth that is absent from achieving the Islamic caliphate, and what will happen if it is achieved and the mechanisms to achieve it, will it succeed in solving the state&#39;s problems economically, socially, religiously ... and so on. The writer confirms his ideas during the period of Sayyidina Uthman and after that the killing of Uthman, a mandate for the rule of the Umayyads, the rule of the Abbasids. Some Umayyad and Abbasid rulers mentioned separately ... But: The clarifications that the writer referred to during this period did not add to the balance of my knowledge anything because it is a period that no one knows about it and many interpretations abound that a so-and-so hero is a serial killer ... and he mentioned this period Either clarifies: that the Islamic religion is not static that its teachings, orders, and intentions cannot be taken as a divine thing that cannot be changed and that it changes with time by virtue of the period in which we live .. and it has been expressed that usury is permissible in cases and is not considered static. Or, either he makes clear: Islam is not a religion and a state, and that Islam is in Alain and the state is our life and what we can do or change with our hands, and he explained this by mentioning the ugliness of the actions of some Umayyad or Abbasid caliphs ... and he was inflicted upon our master Uthman himself ... what excites me that he talks about a period No one is sure about what happened with her and confirms his views during this period .. And I say if this period was vague, how can you build on it the foundations and ideas ..? And I rely on Al-Tabari’s sources for the history of the caliphs to Suyuti, but it is not enough for me ... With the idea of the Islamic state that they are unable to set up a program to run this country, which is for It puts a secular program to see a secular state. . How will the economy, housing and ... and ...?
One of the worst books that I have read. Boring. And the words of compacted behind some without any meaning. What I could complete
A very ordinary narration and what you deserve is the noise
Weak. There is a private car park for guests. There is no internet in the rooms, and there are no tea or hospitality tools in the rooms, dirt on the bed sheet and leftovers on the floor of the room were not previously cleaned, and the toilet is very small and there are not enough toiletries for bathing and cleaning, and the refrigerator in the room is broken and not repaired, frankly it does not deserve No stars.
The failed hotel. nothing. everything
I have two experiences with this restaurant The first experience We requested in the company several types of pizza, potatoes and salads, but we were disappointed after there was an insect in one of the pizza boxes The second experience I asked for a kind of pizza I do not mention his name but in the menu it is not hot but after I arrived home and when my children ate the taste and found It&#39;s so hot crying about myself a red x
I do not know the source of the glorification of Mustafa Mahmoud, specifically by the Egyptians? Most of the surface is closer to the book, but perhaps because birds of a feather flock together ...
I went to read this book after all the commotion that usually follows or precedes the descent of one of the writer&#39;s writings and this after I looked at some of her other trilogical books, my eyes were running on his letters without the meanings penetrating in my chest as usual ... and he was disappointed Very hope. In my opinion, the topic that I wrote in all these lines is originally not of that magnitude that requires writing in it, especially with his association with the man and the woman and the relationship between them, which the writer sanctified in all her malfeass until she made it a condition upon which life is based. ..And she is seeking help from God and inviting Him to forget about women steeped in consecutive love relationships, forgetting the opinion of religion itself in similar relationships and its illegitimacy before marriage. It is an indifferent dare in my opinion and merely the absurdity of a group&#39;s philosophy in a book sold at a high price. And Ahlam in her writings wears a logic that disavows Sharqia and its morals and beliefs ... I sometimes feel that it is rather that it is written about the abstract person, separated from any beliefs and not bound by restrictions
Among the most bored novels I have read, I do not know what is the purpose of writing it or what is the main subject of the novel
My opinion can be summarized in this novel despite what is said about its excitement and suspense, for which the author tried hard to borrow for Dan Brown&#39;s style, but with a much weaker level. A Jew and showing the Muslim Arab as the weakest and most affected .. The difference between them is that the writer did not hide his inclinations to tip the Israeli and his inclination and tried to be an advocate of peace in a naive way that does not possess the lowest degrees of sophistication .. He invented the structure a new secret represented in the Minora and tried to call us in a rude way to Impacting R symbols of Judaism and faith in it and the conviction of its sanctity .... And focused on distorting the image of the Mujahideen and making them the worst in the eyes of all his Jews and Muslims alike.
On the first page, I was very impressed. The devising of my poems by Cavafy was very liked, and most of the poems I chose were the same poems that I liked when I read Cavafy. After that he started repeating, at the end of the page, you will discover that you are in front of a weak and flabby building, and the workers revolve around themselves. And the division of the first manuscript by Alexander Singopolis to the sections entitled is not surprising of any technical necessity, the chapters return the same words or at least this is the prevailing impression. The intensity of similes began to be ridiculous, and the topic reached the degree of brutality and vulgarity at times. The section entitled Ithaca Balnasbali is the climax of the fall of the novel ... a very contrived end. The same that I sensed when I concluded a moon on Samarkand ... and they are the two narratives that I read to their village after I decided to go back to take a second tour of Arabic literature .. which is before a professional writer, not an artist
The same mashed story in all similarities to novels written by A. Dua .. A cheap and expendable story..A Daa is committed to applying it to a panorama of Drama and Nile Drama and Life Series .. Then she watches the series Al Mal and Al Banoun .. After him, the series Al Shahd and Tears ... after that you start writing ..... People are beautiful, people are beasts, false love is a part of people, people who remain sweet are monsters who are not sweet, they blame those who remain monsters, they return those who are sweet, they are upset, that the monsters returned sweet ... ..etc. Passport tube with two bursts marched, but not marched, etc. a. Duaa is almost as personal and preserved and kindly repeats them ... but by the change of events and the names ... but it is disgraced, or the system is this. Very direct advice. Allow to get married .. Allow her to wear it is not good .. Allow a lot of make-up .. Allow excitedly attend lectures ... Allow and behold .. Allow your monster ..... her brother Rakhim .. her brother is watching her .. her brother is an informant .. ..... forgive his blood is light .. forgive his blood is light .. forgive his blood is light ...... I am weak personality .. I am weak personality .. I am weak personality .... This is not Baghbagan .. this is the slope that a follower has to follow in writing it. This is a very weak style .... oh, so where is the fun? It is possible from me to go to Tats, the slaughter of our neighbor, tell me stories that are better than de a million times ... The respectable girls are the girls who fear the Sharia and Islamic and women&#39;s forums, but if I ask Allah’s forgiveness, I mean, I entered Twitter, I must remain with her forbidden ... forgive his sister with His owner is normal and meekly, but if his friend reflects on me, he will be annoyed and suffocate with him. I mean, no matter what the person is, it is not good. He will change over his sister more than a girl who loves her .. Or at least like some, regardless of the wrong principle here and then this is his companions, and you know some bluff and know how to cry for the girl how .. Certainly his age is what you agree with ... Sameh&#39;s character generally has very large inconsistencies .. The character is done in a pure beginner style ... A page that will discover very important information, Arabic clax, voice beep, beep. She came home while she was sleeping ... On a wandering idea, I mean, he walks without a goal and without specifying a specific place, but here the destination with its belongings is determined by the house .. Refer to the dictionary if I want ... There is no god but God .. Muhammad is the Messenger of God. His sentences are sweet .. But if they two love some they say it, they will keep people sweet and we can make fun of them normal. On the page, you will discover that accessories are written by accessories, not to mention the dozens of other mistakes, which are only children in my elementary .. You have, for example, the open, the open, the attached, the .. .. People love love is forbidden .. countries in need of a size Timberland boots are bordered on a gentleman. The author and took a position from Sameh, originally from the beginning of what appeared .. So, of course, he discovered the end easily, Oi ... Do you stay ahead of the events? The most ridiculous thing in this world is the generous comments that are in parentheses. I don’t understand what the mistake is for one who loves his sister’s sister, and he doesn’t do anything for her brother’s brother’s acquaintance and knowledge, and he spoke to her mother also, and then her father’s speeches, and then her speeches, what is the mistake like that? So, at the end of the story, you will discover that it did not come out well ... but why does the writer take it from him, which is also a prejudice of what he is doing from evil deeds? And this is one of the needs that the writer burns the events of her work on her own .. So, I did not know what would happen to the other ... The man who was looking at the supposed channel is Islamic and was cursing in this and insulting this and supposedly mocking this Sheikh .. Also, we are supposed to take his words as a method in our lives Khaled Abdullah. A mother who takes her daughter all the joy, so people can see her and marry her. This is a good mother, and this is true .. I do not understand why these false principles are. I don’t understand why it’s surprising that the bride and groom dance sloo. It is not forbidden to say, and God is great, its triumphs are heroic, the religion is obscured by the intention ... I am my life long by saying I and others in the sense of the number of alliances .. A militarized sister is afraid of my intention: ... a false description that is more than necessary. Songs are not forbidden, do not need, teacher. I don’t understand what is needed for the part in which the hanging church went to, and they read prayers and supplications ... etc. .. I do not see any need other than the distinction between us and our sisters .. And it was possible that Osama Al-Manjuli’s position appears in a million other ways, it is not a condition ... ..And, according to his idea, I went to the hanging church before that .. and the people there are among the best people I have seen in my life and I asked them for such a need especially the columns and they answered me and explained my significance and I asked them about the candles and they were very friendly and they did not choose from our good elders .. There is no inspection at all. The correct dress for the six is the niqab..but the joy dress may remain uncovered, the arms and the chest are a bit shy. In short, it is not a very weak narration .. it is possible to tell him / a long story ... advice from a small brother, I do not intend to make fun of this case, and God: A supplication is useful to a very thought writer of series
The hotel does not deserve this price, there are no parking close to the hotel, the nearest parking is an hourly dirham price, and the crowd is expensive. I did not see what I like. The hotel does not deserve this price, there are no parking lots close to the hotel, the nearest parking is an hourly rate of dirhams, and the crowding of workers and the smell is unpleasant.
Susan&#39;s pictures are beautiful, but I did not find deep ideas, just obsessions and fleeting thoughts.
Evaluating a book like this is very difficult first because it contains many different topics, secondly because I am not Egyptian so I cannot say for sure whether it deals with important Egyptian issues, or that he condoned what is more important, thirdly because I am not a fan of Ahmed Helmy, this does not necessarily mean I hate him, but I am less tolerant of him than his fans, and I do not have enough patience to wait for the writer while he is searching for words to compose an article that will not be used at all .. Fourthly, being away from Arabic literature recently, but this did not prevent me from noticing that this book is far Far from Arabic literature .. The truth is, of course, I enjoyed reading a few articles, but the method is painful Doug between the vernacular and Alvsahya Vkdna Htrama writer.
Too bad I would not recommend it at all, eat bad taste, way of serving worse, treating staff another thing. In short, no one wastes his time and his money in this restaurant.
disappointing. Proximity to the Sacred Mosque. Unavailability of a hotel parking lot and taking advantage of that from the hotel security staff to request the money
Very weak. . A rude and bad Pakistani employee, and his side was a rude employee who never spoke, he was helping him with the reservation program and wearing the same uniform, he was not satisfied to give us two entry cards to the door of the room, so every time I told them to open the room, when my colleague was sleeping in the room, and disturbing the bars he reached the rooms
A book that contains a collection of articles, ideas and experiences written in a beautiful show. Inflating the idea that society is involved in the hypothetical world and completely forgetting it is a trivial hypothesis that is never true. Even his idea of the cool attendees of Starbucks was superficial and surprised at his great generalization of everything. He cited his proverbs and wisdom, even though he said he does not care. I lost interest in reading from the page, but I continued it anyway.
Ok. After the novel concluded the truth I was confused. Let me talk about the novel colloquially. First, the novel does not have a plot. Meaning, we can divide the novel into novels. The novel, up to the first page, is her story revolving around Marwan and his journey with the draft novel that I want to write. During his trip, he falls in love with two boys and betrays them with his next and one blue, so I had no taste ... which was the most ridiculous part of the novel. The second section, Biddour, on Marwan Al-Ali during his journey in search of an idea for the novel that I want to write, to discover a book in which state security secrets reveal the involvement of members of the anti-drug police with drug dealers in facilitating trade in exchange for a percentage of profits and the Arabic film that we sure heard about before that. This part is quite acceptable. The next section is Bidour about Marwan and his involvement with the Hamas group in Palestine because of his brother Mazen who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood who is a branch of Hamas in Egypt .. The most important thing is that Marwan is kidnapped and does a certain task in Palestine and in the end they change his name and identity and flee to Switzerland .. The tale is empty. Of course, it was necessary to burn some events in order to clarify the general atmosphere of the novel and the reason for the lack of plot, even if the one who burned it did not live from the novel. The important. The novel feature has two needs. The most wonderful style for a young writer, and this is his first novel. The second need is the last part of the novel that took place in Palestine. This was the real fun part. The disadvantages of the novel are many, but some of them can be overlooked as the novel is the writer&#39;s first work. First, the dialogue at the beginning of the novel, the writer made a mistake in it, and I found it previously in youth novels more than once .. It is a topic that mentioned the names of the two parties to the dialogue within the dialogue. This makes the dialogue appear as if it is a dialogue with a translated or dubbed movie. ..But this point gradually disappeared in the second text of the novel, and it almost disappeared in the last part. The second disadvantage is that the characters are not adequately drawn. Most of the characters came out very superficial..and many personalities appeared and disappeared unnecessarily. The third defect I mentioned earlier is that there is no plot. The novel can be divided into separate stories. The fourth disadvantage is the lack of consistency of events at a certain rate. Sometimes the events are very fast, sometimes they are very slow. Despite all of this, the novel is good. The beautiful style of the narration and the standard language compels me to overcome defects and I say that the work is good. The novel, compared to other youth novels, is ranked higher than many of the idiots who gained fame and deserved approval. Waiting for other works and better development, God willing
very comfortable . The room was distinctive and the services were great. Delayed entry to the room
One of the worst things I&#39;ve ever read. At the beginning, the title of the book attracted me, and I thought that Halaqi had good content, but unfortunately, the book disappointed me. I expected that I would find valuable information about the origins and history of atheism in Islam, but I found that the author elaborated on mentioning trivial information that was not final useful. Most of Mazalani’s need is that Godreds are not negative
Accepted. . Nusabs sat in an apartment ..bba with fees and surprises, surprised me, aftermarket deduction and the side on the street disturbed cars
Weak. . The room that my side is fond of charcoal and smells of money is full floor.
A curriculum vitae .. It is not a problem .. The book, printed by most biographies, does not provide much, but there is a general feature that there is no objection to it .. The objection and what is taken on the writer is his underestimation of the value of the farmer and rural life in his time with his strong self esteem .. Book No Worth reading
No, Remada Hafr Al-Batin. . Unfortunately, the level of cleanliness is very poor. The floor is dusty, the curtains are yellow and dust-free
As if this novel is the sequel or the second part of the writer&#39;s novel itself, the ceiling of sufficiency. A weak man adores a woman in an illegal relationship, then marries and gets busy with her life, while the hero involves and lives on the anniversary and escapes from Riyadh to distant western countries to forget her, and he does not forget.
Weak. The place is full of cockroaches and can not sleep in the bathroom.
Comment I was shocked by the food, its quality is very unsatisfactory, it lacks a lot of salt and meat, it lacks seasoning, and there is a taste that is not at the acceptable level.
Flight of Abit. More stories told me laughter ... changed my mood in a second. It got me out of the mood of gloom. I saved her in hours of her simplicity. The genie Imad Fadila, I liked it very much, and they separated me:
Weak. Close to the Institute of Public Administration and the Al Baik restaurant. The hotel is old and worn out
Disappointment . Nothing many notes, especially the bed. Rob is not available after shower
I read it twice and the third time a quick reading, the first time I was motivated by my enthusiasm for the book, and the times that followed it showed me some points that disappointed me.
Forced, and by God ........... I don&#39;t know whether it was good and I hated it because it was my decision in the study, nor what do you not know
From my point of view, the first part drew me a lot more, but it is not difficult
I found that the book is a group of intertwined and unconnected thoughts .. It moves you from one idea to another, and I really did not know what the book is about ... I feel that his address to the moon is interchangeable with texts ... many emotions and suddenly advice or a lesson I think the book could have been summarized in a page of advice ... his opinion of the mind, heart and beauty I never liked ... its simple language we find some The pretty analogies that I thought would have been the essence of the book if I had limited them ... much, much repetition ..
A good book but flawed, it&#39;s very emotional. And intellectually disciplined in most of his intellectual theses
Poor management and rooms not shown, booked Sweet for two adults and two children, but only children were provided with beds. Only highlight of the hotel is the location. The policy of paying the amount is not clear, a tax was not calculated except when paying the amount and I discovered that it is very exaggerated, and I booked a sweet for two adults and two children, but the suite has only one bed and the extra bed for the two children for a fee and this is not found in the hotel announcement on the Bukking website
I do not know where the aim of the novel is, and where is the horror? It does not mean that I have a certain measure of horror, but the stranger who was in it did not have a horror on the one hand, and he was poor, he wanted to know. Style is not a hero. But the parallel cutting is not consistent and is not understood in some parts of information. It is not possible. It is the only useful thing that you have benefited from some terms or information about mental illnesses and the reasons for diagnosing wrong diseases, which could be the reason was possible or the story has cattle with the aim that it was feasible
My expectations were higher than what I read ..
Very weak. . The employee who made your check if he didn&#39;t take Debosset bed is uncomfortable, and the pillows are uncomfortable
A very romantic, but the end is very bad and contains many parts
Bad book. The story itself has a deep meaning and could have been written better. But writing style is weak and narration is bad. Some statements provoked me very much, for example, in the heart of nowhere, this is what I mean. . And many other expressions are so lame that I doubted that the book was translated. Of course, a newspaper is very little and not sufficient to communicate the purpose of the novel properly
Very weak. Nothing bad, the hotel is very poor, staff is poor, cleanliness is not available and breakfast is not varied. The reception was very bad and a double sum was taken from me because the receptionist assured me that there is no empty room at the time of my arrival and he asked me a double sum to provide a room and the independence of my arrival and I am tired of traveling
O God, separate us from the novels of poker, what appeared from them and what was inside
Very weak. . Cleanliness and poor customer care
A light film, although it could be presented better. The film is simply taken from a foreign movie named around the film&#39;s hero who loses his short-term memory and suffers until he finds a way to retain his memory by writing on his arms, although this point could have been broken out with a strong movie like the Meccano movie if it had been dealt with More seriously and more deeply, but the film came out light and simple comedy without any benefit but laughter and this reduces the power of error in the scene of the arrest of Khairy Bay Mansour Ahmed Ratib, he was confused as anyone condemned and did not try to defend himself until it seemed that he himself needed to see the end Real to know a criminal Real, Salah Mohamed Lotfi, the movie as a beautiful and light comedy, and it can be seen, but with a gap like the gap in the end, you cannot get out of it with anything more than some laughter that did not reach the franchise as a comedy, not even a franchise like a movie that discusses this disease, not even a romantic movie like Mikano, so the movie is a ball that refuses on the ladder. Between comedy and seriousness and has nothing to do with romance because the hero&#39;s wife died and he did not like others. I hope to watch movies stronger than a star the size of Karim Abdel Aziz after the level he reached with a film such as one of the people and out of law and cousins.
Bad . I swear by Allah the Great. By God, it is equal to the text of a star
Weak. . The delay in the entry procedures and the time of admission is four o&#39;clock in the afternoon and the poor level of services. The reception does not answer the call from the rooms. We needed a baby crib and they did not attend the room.
disappointing. The air conditioning is cold and the TV has a variety of channels. The internet is with money ... the view is very ordinary, what you deserve .. the beach of the hotel is not interested in it, and the bathroom is a catastrophe for Muslims, the toilet is in its room and the shower is in another room
Leah&#39;s first experience in a collection of stories is only a humble experience. Frankly, I don&#39;t know, because I saw a lot of films, but nothing in stories that was easy to expect. This has a point. The protagonist is super smart, and this thing left the novel without experiencing the one-off excitement. I am like my opinion, thanks to the fact that you focus more on the injured than the doctor, and this is what is confused in the novel. But please, thanks for the very useful information in strangers. I love psychiatry very much, but my curiosity is all in the case of the patient who had to explain all its aspects. Thanks :
Worst experience of setting up. . The site pitched and the room smelled bad and the toilets without a shower. Rinse the bad staff. The system was erected in the account. We entered the dawn to arrive from travel. Our departure in the afternoon meant only we needed hours. Bad treatment and not taking into account the fatigue of travelers
Too bad. . More than one room was booked and a request was made to be next to each other and the request was not implemented and communication with the Poking team was not met and the request was not met and the reception team was very bad and the first thing I got was the receptionist made a mistake in the amount due which led to a problem occurred I noticed the check-out and many other problems call me to not Choose it next time
The hotel is uncomfortable and not suitable for family accommodation, the beds are also uncomfortable and the staff are not helpful. nothing.
I was so excited about the 3D triple that I bought it extraordinarily original, I mean. The surprise was. A boring story and a bad plot, as if it were not Khairi Shalaby at all. ..I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll finish it soon
The worst hotel I&#39;ve stayed in. I wish I did not live in a dilapidated hotel, and its price does not rise to be a better hotel. A very old, worn out hotel that does not rise to be even two stars .... the heat is high in the hotel and the air conditioning does not work at all and the room is free from the temperature of the external atmosphere.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, there is a gift with the book, which is a hundred sentences on.
I expected a better ending than that ... the novel was interesting all the time, but it ended with a strange end,
A novel with a long sense of purpose
My first reading of Jose Saramago ... The truth is: very bad. Regardless of the fact that Saramago wrote the novel as a kind of satisfying his atheistic desire to ridicule the idea of God in general and everything that God has done to humans and humans in the past, and in a manner that is completely devoid of any fitness and violent irony, the style of the novel is really modest and its path is very straightforward mixes the evangelical facts Much of the author’s work and fantasy of the author, and in a way that makes it difficult for you to know the facts in the middle of all this, except that we go back and remember that the author originally did not write the novel to recount historical facts but only for crude irony ... let alone that the translation of Saleh secular and what a strange thing is very modest and surprisingly literal, The text block itself contains a report None of any text formatting or punctuation, and the dialogues are mixed with the narration in a very confusing and inconvenient way to read ... The novel is written by one of the beginners atheists, who are overly spreading to them childhood atheism groups, and it seems that most of the intellectuals come at this point of divine and release their entire stock. From intellectual idiocy in some way .. In short, the novel was a really bad experience, and I hope that it will not be Saramago&#39;s work available in my book of drawing, calligraphy and small memories in this way ..: /
I tried to comfort myself for an hour and two comments, but I would have appreciated the book if I could evaluate it with the negative. Its value was .. First, the questions, punctuation, and punctuation marks are many and bad on one page, more than inquiries? what happened ? How did the topic end? The most important question is? And every time the pound comes, it repeats the same cold events in his body, and he cannot pay attention or move his limbs. Her voice is like the snake&#39;s snake with the ringing of bells. It is said that this means a terrifying description. And the accident of run over the dog is routine, we heard it a lot and became very consumed. Moreover, when his friend said look, Joseph turned to him, the author did not even mention the reason for paying attention. I mean, he mentioned anything, any details, but it was just that we were told that the dog was the genie and that obvious thing that needed to be mentioned .. his snake accident and Yasser refused to go to the doctor on the pretext of what he says to him? The words and irons are not convincing. When the family of Yusuf was burned and moved to an apartment, and after the problems Yusuf and Yasser went through with the residents of the room, Yasser posed the idea of leaving the room, and Yusuf objected on the pretext of his family’s financial condition. Ok and fella harvested from the mother tree or the family&#39;s material status. They were allowed to buy it. As for the end, how did the snake inhabit Yasser’s body because he killed her father, brother, Scorpio and Mouse? Disaster and smash the meaning of suspense and excitement. What disturbed me is that I bought the second part, house number, and I have to read it, because my money does not go to me, and God helps me.
A beautiful book for a specific category of females, and he described a specific category of males and contains useful advice for the problems in which girls fall into this time .. The book never attracted me and I did not see in it any kind of challenges that dreams brought us about, but its content was clear in language and meaning ..
Not sweet and not a monster. It was a completely ordinary book
Vile htan. His love for her and his sweet words will not forgive his mistake, which he did against her. I forgot something lost. She is female, female and female, characterized by jealousy:. So let her know what she did. She sold you as I sold it even though I trust her heart is still hanging on you:. His description of his father&#39;s loss locks his tears, freezes the lump in the throat and makes him cry so much:. The novel is good, but its style is never enthusiastic at first. And as usual, the sex component is overwhelming and never fits into a conservative and religious society as ours. Especially since he is a Saudi and knows this. And there are frank things that are laughable, it is clear from the novel that there is a filling of words and stick them together with regard to adoration, love, and materializing things that are felt in the female. I generally advise anyone to read it. It has nothing of benefit and benefit. I read it to myself a little bit further:
Two stars for the very new and very beautiful idea, except that the novel lacks a lot, a lot, and a lot of maturity in writing. It is clear that the author is a young man from the style that is close to the style of expression of schools and the closest plot to the accounts of the five adventurers and demons .. Almost all events are expected, including the event that the writer wanted to be a surprise, so there was no suspense, no character building, and no narration technique, in a nutshell that does not distinguish the novel Anything but an innovative idea:
The name of the hotel is actually a bachelors apartment. There is no. Inconvenient inconvenience and reception, cleanliness and pictures differ from reality and do not classify a hotel
Unfortunately, I am unable to complete it, and I do not like it, and the possibility of the translation being caused is not known
Does not deserve . Good morals Saudi staff at the reception. I did not like the level of cleanliness is bad, there are no automatic dispensing machines, they only accept cash doors for the room, they are not closed due to hardware malfunction, do not deserve four stars, and the windows are not safe for children with me on the seventh floor.
Wrote tips and advice. It has no use or point. It may provide you with nice phrases, but where are the mechanisms for their implementation or how to instill them as an authentic behavior in a person I don’t know
Surprised by the classification of the novel with the list of the best Arab novel, I think that the list is classified according to the countries and an attempt by the owners of the list to include all Arab countries to please everyone .. I did not find a meaning for the novel or did not reach me because of a lack of my understanding and what I understood about what you are talking about. And she was not talking about a social problem that the writer tries to present. I did not find depth in the characters. There are no dramatic events that draw the reader to know the end of the novel. The only goodness in the novel is the beauty of its narration.
Weak. . The hotel is for the Indians and the beds are uncomfortable and the inconvenience of the guests and visitors in the lobby reaches the rooms and the smell of the wardrobes is a must not worth four stars
Only you express me ... Paulo has a great ability to express on his behalf largely
I didn&#39;t understand what Duha said exactly ?????
There is nothing wrong with the Sindhi exhibition. Ahmed Khaled Tawfik, except for like Icarus, of course..Da applies to the recent numbers of Safari and Fantasia, and the special issue that has been titled ... The number of new Fantasia has features from late night and Aljathom duality, which is the dualism as its audience knows, one of the highest manifestations of nature. .. some degree of sophistication, some suspense, some imagination, and a good ending that was boiled somewhat ... I flattened with the general level of exhibition releases, and two thousand more from our professor, because of the enormous atmosphere of narratives, such as Icarus and Sinja.
I did not enjoy the book much .... I applied some of his advice during the book, including not reading it all .... I read the book quickly ..... But as the writer said that a book is not without its benefits ... Yes, I found some benefits ... But it was not as I imagined it .... I would not advise you to waste a lot of time on it ..... let it pass quickly
It is not a dream, there is nothing more to say than that it is repugnant at all. We have stayed in several hotels in Dubai and have never been disappointed, but this hotel was truly terrible. Also important to me was that it was dirty in both our room and the breakfast room.
Very weak. . Unfortunately, Mako Shi opened the breath at the hotel, and one of the reception staff took an extra dirham from me
I started reading this book at the beginning of my day in a car, and I finished it at the end of the day while I was lying in bed:. The book is very light, its content includes some of the writings of Dr. Ghazi, may God have mercy on him, and translations of other books. Here is a quote from the tide sheet :. : //. // ...
Credibility is important. The view is beautiful. The price is very expensive and the bathroom is not suitable for the hotel. The Jacuzzi takes out dirt and the room has been changed twice.
I will not repeat check-in at the hotel even if it is the last hotel in Jeddah. Location only. The corridors of the rooms smell very unpleasant. Very, very furniture. The bathroom is very old. Bedding is very consuming and causes itching throughout the night.
The price is for the hotel. . The dimension of the Prophet&#39;s Mosque and the furniture are very old and even windows do not exist to ventilate the muffled rooms
A very weak woman who bears responsibility for her cheese in front of him every time she abandons her
very bad . The site is opposite the Hamarain Center. Cleaning services. Workers do not respond quickly when you ask them to clean the apartment. The electricity always turns off when we turn on the oven for cooking. Furniture is very poor and outdated. There is not enough parking. There is no swimming pool.
My dream, please, two pans, this three .. He loves answering the word two hundred meaning behind each other .. He separated me hours, but in articles I liked, such as sunrise.
I did not like the book at all, in addition to the fact that the Arabic translation is very poor ...
I did not like this place. Proximity to the sanctuary. Cleanliness is very poor, especially pillows, no Wi-Fi
I do not recommend it to a brother or a friend. I don&#39;t like anything. Services ... hygiene .... presented the furniture to the point that the sitting chair was broken .. I asked for a plate and did not respond, except for those who first got to the reception the second day
I just enjoyed it because I decided to enjoy and not the hospitality of the staff. The swimming pools are great location. There is no cleanliness and there are cockroaches in the room
Like almond blossom or the farthest name that has the sparkle of diamonds and the fragrance of jasmine, which spread quickly with the help of a storm represented by the name of Mahmoud Darwish, but for me it was a failure and a fall of the poet from the place he had got in my heart. For her flags, her pioneers, and an understanding of his color. Very simply, Mahmoud Darwish in this book did not have the poet’s sense nor the writer’s sense of thought, so he described it devoid of any feeling with the absence of the subject&#39;s unit horribly and the absence of a tone in the words, then it is not rhyming or free poetry nor a simple poem, and the writer himself appears in this book as if he is not familiar I reached it in Arabic using the word from the general public to be a fragile companion of eloquence and the public tongue. Therefore, I did not like his style or even his subjects. I did not feel what I read and did not feel in it any literary type, as it is inferior to being classified as poetry but rather fits into the simple prose ranks. My first trip is the last in the world of the dervish, as poetry in all its forms is like the sea, and we readers are the pioneers of ships in it. It is authorized to sail, bound, free of its passengers, as the captain&#39;s poetry is free of originality and long tradition. I would like to point out that this is my personal feeling towards this office, and it may clash with the opinions of readers who do not share the same viewpoint with me, but this is what I felt during my reading of this book and I said it honestly here.
Poor corresponding to the value of the reservation. The cleaners treated them better than the reception staff. Receptionist very poor internet
I did not find what I paid for. Location. The service is the reception, they do not know the rooms and the view is the lack of attention, because they are busy with many inmates. I did not find the criteria that I booked.
A very shallow and shallow story ... A crying page over the ruins
I do not like vulnerable women. I love love, but I do not accept that the woman is weak without dignity in this love .. Dear Jumana, you are provocative to the extreme. You have no dignity. And you deserve the idea .. the story is long and events are frequent, but in different ways. I frankly frowned on half of it, but I wanted to know what was the end to read the second part.
In the sad crowd alone. In my hands Ivory rosary. With her dirt-colored thread. With grains of tenderness get lost. In drops. For centuries, the last one was torrent. As life escapes from between the fingers
Once, boring, Mane was able to complete it, I feel like watching an Indian movie with a little cartoon movies, unlike Hujun, which was a page that pulled me away. I don’t know the idea of the writer, but I expect that I don’t want to be creative, so I can create another novel, but there isn’t
I don’t know who wrote an opinion saying that this novel was written by Colette Khoury in the language that Ahlam Mostaghanemi uses to write her novels, so she has been victimized by an unfair comparison against her. Nobody writes like Ahlam Mostaghanemi .. And had it not been for what I heard about this story reflecting a true story that Colette Khoury lived with the poet Nizar Qabbani, I would never have thought of it ... Nizar was an attraction for my reading this .. As for the novel, it did not offer me anything new .. Rather, it did not rise to be a mirror of something related to Nizar Qabbani ... even the way in which love appeared through it did not reflect his personality or his poetry filled with his poems. The novel is nothing more than an account of the diaries of an oriental lover .. And the beginning of the novel was stronger than its end. The rebellion that appeared as a clear feature in the character of the heroine faded with the growing events and instead appeared a weak personality that needs sympathy and tenderness .. Like all eastern women and eastern men :. The woman offers her abundant affection, and the man thrives on her, and when the woman becomes aware of the wound of her dignity and affects the restriction of her emotions, the man becomes aware of the importance of what he has lost and tries to restore it.
Perhaps because she was one of the first novels of Buthaina. She was not good enough to compare with her other novels ... exaggerated passion and unconvincing love story by Meshal. It was good, but being affiliated with Buthaina Al-Essa, my expectations were high. I only found disappointment ..
Bad reception. . We waited hours to enter and hours when leaving the elevators and narrow lanes feel like you&#39;re in prison
The interior rooms are poor and below standard. The location is good..the corridors of the hotel are acceptable. Inside the rooms are very worn out, even the towels have been in use for years, and have not been altered, they seem to be just jolting as they wash them
what is this? Ha? Someone please make me say two dimensions, tell me this hard: /
A strange novel sometimes feels just a stale hallucination. Sometimes it feels great. But for sure, I did not like her
No kisses .. kisses for a prostitute more sacred than anything else. Niah taught her that she should keep the kiss for the man she will love so much. The mistake is not Koilho&#39;s fault ... it is the fault of prostitutes and teenagers who like this shit. Coelho takes on the role of Asha Carrera and writes to us a lesson in the art of sex in all his situations .. In fact, the comparison with Asha is unfair compared to her, as she at least has intelligence that Coelho does not have half of ... Anyway, Coelho seems quite an expert in sex movies and raises the slogan:. If you have not seen porno before, I will write to you a detailed description of one of the most important sections of porno ... . For the sake of ignorant people like your readers or viewers ... When any reader criticizes any book because of the presence of sex in it, the writer’s response is often in the following sentence that sex is an important part of our lives and the objected reader is a person who is mentally ill and needs treatment ... I ask Here .. and why the writer is not a psychopath who vomits his disordered sexual fantasies on the pages of the book and gives them to both the teenage reader and the prostitute reader? . but not . The great writer could not be mistaken, it is the fault of an ignorant, open-minded reader, like me, that he does not understand literature. Well ... I am an ignorant person and do not understand literature ... The author is a literary masterpiece and a poem in the love of the Holy Sex .... So what about the sentence that opened my review? . The virtuous prostitute, and please do not ask how to be a prostitute and virtuous at the same time. The question to someone other than God is humiliating, my brother. ? Really? Are kisses not part of the body? . I don&#39;t understand is a bitch selling her body and not selling her soul? Or is her soul only focused on her lips? Then what about her vagina? Does her lover have the right to pierce him, or does her spiritual lover only have to touch her lips? . Any nonsense, no shit. Coelho lost all his balance completely .. and became at the same level in which I put Ahmed Khaled Tawfik and Ahmed Mourad. Thanks for the great author
Unfortunately, it could have been better than this
Weak. Internet. the hotel
I usually do not read Arabic novels. I love narration without cost. I do not like rhymes and terminology of this kind. I did not understand the meaning of the story and did not like the end
Frankly, if I had less than a star, I would have performed it. I just completed it as a matter of fulfilling the duty, but it is very strong.
Very weak. . They carried out the reservation
A good book is a bit boring. It was possible to display the content in a more beautiful way. Overall, it is nice that he touched on the issue of education in Arab countries and creativity
This is not politeness ... nor romantic. Teenager thought ... a weak language ... not a plot..and not a knot that has value .... being vulgarly consumed ... a consumed idea .... and do not come out of it with any benefit except that the awareness of the recipient is in the gutter so that something like this will be said It has a novel and sells four editions. In the opinion of Akkad, we learn from trivial acts the meaning of triviality. Shame
disappointing. . There are cockroaches in the room and the bathrooms, the reception team was not helpful and slow to help and they do not answer the call from the room sometimes, there is no remote control for the TV in the room and Wi-Fi is limited to only two devices and it is not possible to connect more than two devices.
The way we communicate with others and with ourselves determines the quality of our lives, Anthony Robbins. We cannot solve differences in the same way of thinking that was used to find these differences. Albert Einstein. Do not judge people from the meaning of their behavior for you, but for them. We may not get what we want, but we will definitely get what we deserve. Doug Horton .. There is no failure, but unexpected results Bandler
The first time I get to read a novel, the series or movie that I work on is better
I can&#39;t give the novel a higher rating than that ... P. First: The writer often uses the method of analogy and description that is useless and stuffs the novel and empty it of its original content. Second: She gave a role to the Arab woman in the form of naivety and stupidity. I do not think that there is a woman of this degree of naivety and she thinks about materialism, so it is to satisfy the one she loves and at the expense of herself. Third: It makes the reader spin in an endless maze, as it sometimes talks about the present and another time in the past, which makes the reader not know where he is in the past of an aura or its present.
Despite my love for Oulu writings, I am fed up with his repetitions as updates
Worse than imagined. nothing. Services are non-existent and cleanliness is not present at all, in addition to the poor quality of the family and the room size is very small and the lack of available positions and we did not find any internet at all and more that the pages need to explain
As a literary fiction from fiction, I can tell it to children before bed. Maybe I will give it stars. But as an interesting and useful literary work, one star is enough.
Failed experiment . I didn’t like anything but going out from the first day and we thank the buking and the hotel staff for returning the amount I paid. everything
The book was not as expected. I don’t know why I remembered the next statement after I finished the book. Whoever tastes known, and who knows
Mohammed . The place is very far from the touristic places in Jeddah and the inconvenience is very high due to the construction of the hotel adjacent to the cleanliness is normal and the brushes are old and worn out and not identical at all to the pictures in the site, it means from the other a group like liars and expensive prices. The luggage is very bad, the inconvenience is very high, and it is very far from the beach
disappointing. . The reception deal is very CNN
Weak. . Not good cleaning for two rooms suited
disappointing. Tranquility and hotel suitable for families. Housekeeping service is not around the clock only to the afternoon furniture and mattresses need cleaning and switching
Poor hygiene. Bus delivery to the campus. The cleanliness of blankets, bedspreads and towels, as we were introduced to a used room, and this does not work even for poor-quality hotels
The idea of the book I liked .. To read about the topic of what was written by a person who lives the experience is very different .. But after I finished the first chapter almost I felt a kind of boredom .. The sentences are repeated as if the writer wanted to pass his ideas in more than one way to ensure their arrival and give them the desired effect .. Abhor the tribalism, the method of forming it for himself and the charisma he enjoys despite using the word misplaced more than once. I wished more that I would know about his life in the care home .. about his experience in high school and university..these important milestones passed through to read in some passages exaggerated details, such as that he woke up in the hour such and prayed and ate food..etc. Also, the flow of events was interrupted more than once in a somewhat dispersed manner, such as when he spoke about the presence of the Sheikh who was working for him for his graduation ceremony .. It seemed to me that the beginning of this chapter came late, as the chapter that preceded him reached an advanced stage in the relationship between him and the Sheikh, To return and give the impression that he did not expect the Sheikh to come to the graduation ceremony. In total, I could not give more than two stars to the idea itself ... the rest is an attempt by the writer to polish his image.
The game is not original
Very weak. I did not like anything. The Egyptian is on reception, his morals are tired, his style is full, I booked nights, deducted the money from the visa, and I sat a night and got up, and did not return to me the rest of the Wi-Fi with poor and weak discomfort.
Exaggerated amount of love in an awful way ... The beginnings, but I liked it
Hotel needs follow-up staff in all affairs. . nothing. The air-conditioner is ineffective and the safe box. The room has been changed times for malfunctions of the air condition. There are annoyances from those who live in the hotel until late hours, which hindered my comfort in the hotel .. There is a clear weakness in the follow-up staff and the preparation of rooms before the inmate’s residence where they used my time in the room to make the necessary maintenance of the room. It appears that clients are receiving the lowest level of available rooms.
I do not know the truth, where is the problem, in the translation, nor in the way I receive it, but I interacted with my age with anyone or the length of the novel, starting with its text, I was thinking that my nation will be saved. There is a clear documentary importance, and it is revolutionary in the amount of subjectivity of the novel in relation to its time .. But I was bored and very disgusting in return, I was in the last pages as if I were after desert, I do not want to be saved, and it was a disappointing reading of a novel that I thought would be one of the most important readings of the year
I tried to read it but I couldn&#39;t go on. She never liked me. / =
Not for black skin, Wild Beast was a good choice for me until I lost my laptop from the camp and I was treated with all kinds of intransigence because I am black. They never believed me. And I ended up having problems with my employer because of that laptop. I wouldn&#39;t recommend anyone black come to this if you are like me, so stay away. Go to the Mitte Minghi guesthouse in Westlands, you will never regret it. Oh and even for my white friends, please try Mette Minghi guesthouse.
Bad hotel. I liked the proximity of the campus only. The best and cleanest place in the hotel is the reception only .. There are no stops at all. Upon arrival, they did not give me the booked room through Al-Bukank, on the pretext that it was not available. The smell of smoke is disturbing, as do the voices from the neighboring rooms. I requested a baby cot and it was only available two days later. The carpet cleanliness is very poor. The price is high compared to the cleanliness and services. I would never recommend it if you want comfort and fun.
not nice.
Normal nice entertainment and just not to take advantage and thank you
Weak. . Very annoyed due to the presence of a wedding hall on the ground floor
Muscat. nothing. Inconvenience and slow services too, and the rooms are not clean, there are no situations and very annoying
the price is too high . Pool period for women, beautiful breakfast, wifi. The entry procedures are more than an hour late, breakfast is not allowed every day, the same items, the inconvenience of maintenance work in the neighboring rooms, the absence of sessions to take advantage of the hotel garden, the absence of a direct beach for the hotel on the sea
Ray divided it into three points. the beginning. She was very strong and pulled any limit .. I felt that I was facing a different kind of narration .. A very successful start .. Events. Underneath that was a lot that lacked many details .. I felt that the writer quickly bounced from what happened to a second pure event, and that he separated me from it .. We like the writer’s focus with one goal and her intolerance to Islam in this way .. I turned the novel to one goal, which is how most of the heroes turn from Judaism To Islam after their fascination with Islam .. I do not have a problem with this idea .. The problem is that the reasons that left them are very weak and not easily change anyone’s religion .. The writer addressed this idea in a very superficial way, and I am not convinced frankly .. who is convinced of him is her fanaticism of Islam only With very weak evidence of their conversion from Judaism to Islam ... the end. The imagination was so abundant that I was provoked ... The end is not walking with the pure events ... The novel deserves two stars for its beginning only.
Vulgarity, regret, endless foresight
The beginning of Sokhna Away Away. And creative characters in the first. Forgotten and what you realize what is forgotten. The fictional character, not from the cutter, is what the author drew. It was good that I felt that I lived with her. But suddenly it gets very rigid paths. With the beginning of the second text, I stuffed like all the threads that were in the writer&#39;s hands had fallen. And everything that was drawn in the first text makes its opposite. I mean, forgetting that the reason for her being aware of the bridges of her weakness is that she did not know how to chill the fridge? Suddenly, he evaporated, knew how to carry the lampshade, walk with it, and attack violin? And before that they liked it, she was a child who did not understand any need in any need. Not early and suddenly, when Jasser touched her, she turned to a girl who shook and remained a woman. How is that? And the idea of the end abandoned the index after it started landing in the second text. Little rose. For the sermon, it was not. And if it is hidden
This is the first book I read for Mr. Ahmed Al Shugairi .. The book is simple and may be a bit useful, but what I did not like is the writing style that combines colloquial and classical Arabic. I didn&#39;t feel any difference between reading the book and watching Professor Ahmed on TV. I expected a different style of writing.
Terrible hotel, dirty, do not go there The rooms we got were very dirty, and the beds were not clean at all. There are no towels in the rooms, and the smell is terrible. There are many Egyptian guests who had their own restaurants and the largest swimming pool for them alone. We, the non-Egyptian guests, had only a small pool. The hotel is supposed to have swimming pools, and somehow there are only two. Meals were not changed every day, sometimes there were no options of drinks during meals and this is an all-inclusive offering. The hotel lanes were cleaned only once during our week-long stay. There were cockroaches in the hotel. An awful place to stay
Without reading any of the writings that this man wrote, or even the writings of Khazbali, may God have mercy on him, Anis Mansour, who is not a true intellectual, but from a cultural claimant, I apologize to the readers, because I will shock them more, as he himself wrote books on ghosts and others, and he transmits other writings from the West and because the complex of Khawaja The Arab and Islamic world hit its African and Asian sides with colonialism, and since Napoleon laminated Egypt with artillery, and the soldiers of the Ottoman Mamluk Empire, the backward, with swords, Arabs, and Muslims, fought against the Khawaja complex, everything that came in the West shines with gold, if someone in the West claimed that he saw God in a dream and said To him, he accepted Islam, they say so and so in the West he holds a degree in physics, he saw God and said to him, Islam accepted, while the uncle of his servant, the seller in the countries of the Arab world, said the same words to accuse him of ignorance and insanity ... The American and the Europeans, perhaps the same reason that called him to stand in the presence of Sadat and the Egyptian peace treaty, are the same ideas that everything that comes from the West is called the gold in the eyes of my eyes and my head and Western civilization is one of the most important civilizations in the universe, but more presented to humanity more than all the eastern civilizations presented in its history Regardless of the phenomenon Colonization and world wars As for western society, there are neither feathers on the head nor the eye, and feathers like the Arab societies and others do not have feathers and invitees, but their chances of education were better, so when they set up, the monument makes sense in the West. There are jugglers and there are swindlers who treat people with fish, laughter, and yoga, the whole world It is considered that writings such as Eric von Dunkin fall within the scope of false science and review through the web the hypothesis of ancient astronauts and you will see that Egyptologists and real history scientists see that such words do not relate to science and not everything that glitters gold reaches sales of writings e A Swiss researcher, as we have admittedly argued that he is a true researcher to a million books annually and wrote more than one book. In fact, the classification of such works as false science or writings falsely or falsely depends on the nature of the science itself, which relies on refutation, not emphasizing material, not on fiction. Therefore, this man&#39;s writings are popular, while for example, we do not expect that the latest writings of physicists will reap the same sales. They are simply like science fiction novels, but they are sophisticated. It is not possible to subject the jinn and ghosts to scientific studies, so all scientists except for the supporters of the false science consider that ghosts and jinn have reasons. Psychological and nervous And some people measured the electromagnetic impulses in some places that everyone claims contain ghosts, then they found that these pulses in these places are very high and that it is the reason that affects people’s minds and because of the spread of popular accounts around a place that has ghostly children or a woman who wears a costume Moein claims many people that they saw the same ghost, then the scholars met by comparing the testimonies of many people who were subjected to these experiments and found that the testimonies, despite their closeness, are not the same as what denies the existence of ghosts, and this is why science is called knowledge on this basis, the idea that I measure on it was Brother / Eric F. And Duncan believed in these metaphysical beings mainly regardless of his evidence in the sixty books. So why does he not try to prove that God sent from the sky angels metaphysics and taught human beings how to build civilizations if we were going to fade in the name of science and say that aliens visited the earth and built civilizations and evidence is these drawings and these stones Etc. What prevents many scholars from believing the existence of God Almighty, knowing that I, praise be to God, is a believer and a Muslim. I am talking about scholars if you deny what you do not see in the name of science. Why do some of you call these perceptions a note, no, masters of science has a different path from religion and spirituality And science is characterized by people Von Duncan must first prove the existence of aliens and work with other research teams to establish the existence of other rational beings other than us in space as well as to be advanced because, for information, many hypotheses about the universe say in a clear way, but there are rational and non-advanced beings and therefore do not communicate With Earth, as for there are basically no sane creatures, but there are living beings, and either there is no life essentially outside the planet Earth, despite the observation of the Hubble Observatory of many planets outside or inside the galaxy, but it is so far away that it cannot be studied closely to make sure they are simply valid. The bottom line is not all What shines in gold Von Duncan began writing his books in the year, during which time he talked about the aliens under the American and Russian space programs and also because of the American flying tests that relied on camouflage through these false novels, but his books did not achieve wide spread until after a movie and series. Stargate Gate of Stars in the year and although it is an entertaining movie but it falls under the broad science fiction item and then after the popularity that these ideas acquired cinematically and in science fiction novels these false science supporters began to promote the same hypotheses on a non-scientific basis Gentlemen, he has a well-known style on von Duncan that proves the existence of aliens mainly whether in the planets near us or far away and to obtain clear archaeological evidence from there then for him to claim that they were guests on the earth, how do we accept this insult to us in the recent period what The Egyptians are deprived of their history in the name of the Jews and the servitude of the Children of Israel sometimes and in the name of magic sometimes and now the people of space are sometimes important for the Egyptians to appear ignorant and backward and did not build the pyramids What is this ridiculous .. Why do we not believe the writings of the claimants from the Arab world that the pyramids were built by a people returned and Thamud and why do not we take a long time In absurdity is more art And because he returned and Thamoud mainly from the people of space, no one asked himself who owns the spacecraft how he does not have the video and recording techniques, so he records what he saw on the caves and stones, who owns the spacecraft, how does he not have television, medicine, antibiotics, and everything related to human civilization with a link then scientists begin Pseudo-pseudo-deviation is more in search of a solution to this dilemma and they find nothing more than stupidity in envisioning a catastrophe for which there is no scientific evidence except for one book by Aristotle on a land not related to Egypt and may have sunk signed and toppled all this if that was the case then it makes sense that this catastrophe will topple the life We know it and it will topple the stone before Els The satellite is soft and it is logical that more than three thousand years of archaeological research and exploration that we will find any technical method and not only a stone that proves that a great civilization preceded the present time ... Who searches more will know the responses of the doctor and the distinguished scientist / Zahi Hawas on these peer-to-peer because it is an archaeologist He has a capacity and he can argue with them on the pretext and opinion .. Tariffs in the name of science ... and science is relative, objective, cumulative and material, so what I wrote is literary criticism not my knowledge, science has other rules that are not known to them and I will add to you prose a line I really hope that there will be an advanced space civilization but The truth is that my regards have not and will not yet exist.
Frankly, the book is not for pure atheists, it can be sweet for people who are still thinking and after that you read books that are heavier, or Muslim people are normal, who have questions, but the name is broad, or the book. It may be good for the time you write. It has good answers, and in answers that are not convincing at all, his words on the subject of women mean, for example, I was not convinced about him at all. But in general terms, it means he is walking
The introduction and dedication to Azrael is more than wonderful. The first book read by Youssef El Sebaei, his style and sarcasm draw a smile as long as you read it. The beginning was interesting, after which I felt bored while saving each character with boring details. The end is nice and also the idea that Heaven does not interfere with prayer
Somewhat satisfied. Organizing the open buffet. Reception staff greeted the inconvenience of guests in adjacent rooms and corridors
I think I read it not
The only sentence the two stars deserved is ah. If every man treats his wife as if she were his daughter, the women would live in heaven.
And when Ismail promises you a boring legend, it means what he says .... promise and fulfill
Fine literary style. And only. This book really does not fit to be a novel just for the beautiful style and the use of verbal improvers
My colleague and I ate at the restaurant in September. I was going to this restaurant a year ago. It was the best roast, but now it is very bad .. Those who serve it are Turkish people. They treat them badly with customers .. Their souls with their weight can consider this job less than them? God knows best we asked to eat what came as we asked .. we asked to return it twice and the barkers say nothing with us, but it is ringing .. knowing that he is the one who forgot the request as we told him .. the bill came up high and I reviewed it with him and my brother says I asked him to climb a mountain . The important thing is that we discovered a mistake and the bill was short and Real and I apologize .. For information, their famous delicious bread that was free now has become a money .. On the day we complained why the bread with money and we two asked for an appetizer dish and a grill plate, I mean, it is necessary to bake ... We asked to speak to the manager, they waved a Turkish and no one gave us .. We paid and walked. Conclusion: First, bad and bad, and the best coach must be appointed to the hotel service and restaurants .. Second, a bad smell must be disposed of in the restaurant
A sad, depressing and painful novel
disappointing. Location. nothing
There is no professionalism. There is no. The hotel manager is spoofed and changes the laws of temperament even if he agrees and prevents visitors from entering
Frankly, the design of the hotel is poor, the windows are at the entrance, and we were sensitive. One was watching what was in one, but there was no sense of privacy, especially in a Muslim country. All was normal. The service was good. It needed a change in the level of design.
I liked it, it is classical, and it is a harbinger of aftershocks that can happen without us now. But in its content on women is very difficult, as if the woman is only a commodity and that we have reached the extent of degradation. Where is Allah from all this ??
In fact, I decided to rate the book with a single star. Even no, minus a star. I&#39;ve never seen anything I like. I never like this type of book. I do not classify this book as a satirical book. Rather, they are memories and short quotes from our daily lives. I saw her very personal and something intimate. However, after reaching the last page, the verse reflected for me. The writer of this booklet admits that these stories are far from being a literary work or something similar. In fact, all that matters is that it only treats our laughter. This is a very noble goal in my opinion. I wish the writer all the best in his upcoming works
A group of articles you read after you have concluded a book of dismissal .. digesting it means
I can very easily make fun of this book and say that I wasted my time reading it or that its author appeared to be true and that he is not a real writer, and other subjective talk, but I will speak from my personal point of view as someone who has been reading for more than a year. Historical writing has origins and rules, it is never easy to enter a historical era rich in events and decide to write a novel about it, the natural path that most amateurs will take is the direct narration of events and dealing with historical events directly with the addition of side characters that meet in the middle of the novel to reach the peak, but the most difficult It is to make the events of the novel a reflection of what is happening on the ground, that the historical events are merely a snapshot in the background, but its strong influence is evident in the course of the events of the novel, the novel unfortunately took the first course .. I was not optimistic about the good when the author decided to explain at the beginning of his novel some of the historical events He directly feared, and I feared that this was due to his expectation of the quality of his readers who may not know much about this period, but when I reached the end of the novel I found that nothing new was presented on the level of what he presented in his previous works that relied on excitement and surprise, tales that do not rise to the level of the novel The historical, a direct narration of the events and faded backgrounds, figures that have no dimensions or depth, any character in the novel that can completely erase it from the novel and that will not affect the final work, a summons to scenes we saved from the many cinemas presented in films in our home by a man, sunrise, sunset, and series of Ismail Abd Old Hafiz and others, I thought that Hamad Murad to keep him on his audience, who knows him well and give him what is looking for the thrill and exciting, and there are several quick points I would like to conclude by. I do not think it is appropriate for the author to continue to mix between the paschal and the vernacular, to the extent that he decided to write a popular example of al-Qahb with classical. The characters are rushed to take actions that contradict the image he drew, as the coward suddenly turns into a brave and traitor to my homeland. There are some passages in the novel written in a different script, which means that they may be memoirs of the historical figures covered in the novel, and I suspect that he should have mentioned that at the end of the novel. The writer made a great effort to collect historical events and link them together
Very weak. Nothing, please change the whole administration and staff. The level is very very weak and not suitable for the standard of the hotel
Hope is:. All I know about hope ... is my trust in you, God. My heart is still bright, oh Lord. There is no hope in it and you are all there is. I love you my god
Very weak. . The closest it is to the place where animals are worn out, and insects are everywhere
There are two ways to evaluate the book, the first is through liberating ideas about women and saying that this book is underdeveloped and worse, and the other is the religious view of it, and saying that this book is good .. but here, I do not object to everything that came in the book, and I do not agree with all Something .. but what the book says is somewhat correct. Why? I lived in the West which is sanctified by the Arabs, and I saw nothing but a focus on the body, I saw nothing but harassment but with the consent of the girls .. The worst things were happening in school, and if I got an Arab girl in the street the world would rise, and he did nothing but a simple reprimand .. But, my objections On the book, he said that whatever a woman arrives, she needs to marry, and this is not always true .. The other matter, taking into account the age difference, and the nature in which the Sheikh lived is important.
Bad and I do not advise anyone to live in it according to what I see. Too bad I was deceived by the photos on the Bucking website. Everything is bad The entrance was only air-conditioned
Bad service for money. . Inconvenience from abroad. Internet service is not available. Morning breakfast buffet is limited. Items and staff of the incomprehensible restaurant have limited the rooms to two people for the morning breakfast.
Only his name is known about booking a reservation. nothing. I booked a large apartment with two rooms..and when I came, I did not find an available apartment .. The rooms are one for a large family ..
I previously read this paragraph on Facebook and it is all that encouraged me to acquire the novel as soon as I found it while I was passing by a street vendor .. I do not deny that the writer&#39;s style is great, I liked the way he wrote it and sang his clear cognitive balance through the examples and expressions that made the novel beautiful little bit. But I find myself after I finished it today that the story is not of the type that is interesting and irritating to the feelings as long as it talks about a love story, at least all I saw in the story is chaos and cowardice, the chaos of the hero’s life, which was not logical to me and his cheese from the life of his family. From controlling his feelings, his whims, so to speak .. As for units, they are illogical in some moments and silly in other moments .. I also point out here that I criticize the story and the hero who did not enjoy me or interest me in return, I encourage the writer Muhammad Al-Salem to continue this novel Just a start, waiting for other actions from you .. Thanks for every minute that I killed for you, Hattan.
The period during which the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, stayed in the cave of Hira in which there was a great transgression and analyzes were stupid assumptions quite frankly if it is inconceivable that we enter psychological factors in isolation from the image of Al-Muzzammil that explained the psychological state in that incident and we use it using C and misunderstanding and entering the topic from this side is entering Slander the truth. I do not pretend or know anything in the Qur’an other than the picture of Al-Muzzammil. I talked about the psychological state of the Prophet in a specific event. The comparisons were incapable of the idea of Malik bin Nabi, or maybe I did not understand it in the right way, and I have to read the book more slowly.
disappointing. price. The rooms are not clean and the reception is treated poorly and there is only one employee
They kicked me out even though I made a reservation through booking. I did not like anything. I arrived and tried to sign in. The employee told me that the hotel did not send me acceptance, so there are no rooms available and they did not receive me.
A weak, vulgar, superficial and expected novel from the first page of a page that could be shortened to only one page as usual Muhammad Sadiq takes a great first and very philosophical topic such as the philosophy of death and life and discusses it with superficiality and deludes you that this way of youth thinking is not a strong language nor dialogue And no details for the characters, the title of the novel, Insta Life, the worst title of a novel that I have seen in my life. If it is in a rating that is less than a star, the novel deserves its worth.
It started off with a very great beginning. The truth is .. a start that fascinated me with the selfish personality who lived in the role of the oppressed and always did not move in order to reach any need .. and then I got rock bottom when I turned the atmosphere of human development .. the two stars for the first half only, but after that it is possible to throw a very normal because it is not fading What is necessary is a fact and there is no spirituality mentioned in it
The title attracted me a lot, but my disappointment in the content was not my longing to read it .. At its beginning I felt that the character of this defeatism and anarchism reflected on the writer and affected it, because the ideas were incoherent, they start a story and end with another as if they give us pens heads for everything and nothing ... in the second half From the novel I was amazed at the creativity of the author and her ability to pave the words side by side to give us this wonderful texture of meanings .. In the conclusion of the novel the character of this has developed for me and was able for the second time to make a bold decision in his life, the first time when he escaped from the restrictions of his environment and his tribe and his homeland and disavowed from Its past, present and future This was a sign of his weakness, but the second time when he abandoned his past and his recent memories and this was the evidence of his strength because he had thus triumphed over himself ... this open conclusion gave me a feeling that this dream might return to start from where he left everything behind in December ...
I do not think that I can complete it at least now .. It had a terrible headache; I do not deny that I love the phrases of Yami, but it is pouring artistic pictures and ornate words in the sentences in an unbearable way. I don’t know if I will read it again in the future, but now I am satisfied with a page.
disappointing. Location only. The staff is very poor and the cleanliness is not good. The furniture is like asphalt and most of the problem is from the same population as the family.
It is closer to an article despite its very simple style. However, it does not intend for any explanation or logical progression of things, but rather the outcome. As if it is a Muslim. .................... I recommend the Humpback Universe book to those who wanted a gradual understanding. It is suitable for anyone who wants to understand relativity from its beginnings. It is for non-specialists
Never recommend it. . The hotel is very old and the reception staff treated the hotel very badly and their services are slow Unfortunately foreigners walk in their underwear but inside the hotel it is not suitable for families
Unfortunately, I read part of it and I cannot finish it. I will waste my time on it. What is the purpose of it ?? Neither style nor narration, nor any need, frankly, what is new remains in the topic. Very boring, and the way they talk is old. It is very forbidden that one wastes his time and reads it. I thought that it would keep a new need, but unfortunately
The first meeting with Kafka. It was boring and uninteresting. Unfortunately.
The room you chose is not the same as what you requested. Reception. everything
Yousef Al-Sibai, the boring romantic knight.
Introduce a realistic and hurtful story. The way to list it is not professional. Its end is expected and traditional. You could write a page on it too much. In people in the story, there is no need. No new information you&#39;ve added to the story
It was a failed trip with my stay at a failed hotel. . The staff treated Sie too
Weak. Service and proximity to the campus. The internet connection is bad
I did not like the novel a lot. The author tried to mix the past with the present. He tried to mix the Egyptian revolution with the invasion of Kuwait, but I think it did not work much. Its opening was attractive, but as you continue reading, it becomes clear
very bad . nothing. The worst hotel in the world
Dirty hotel. nothing. Su deal
The second star for a good job of nonsense
Bad . There is no. Too bad, there is no net, there are no situations, the absence of the inmate&#39;s culture first, the lack of respect died before some reception staff
The writer&#39;s style makes living time and space:
Recreational mistake. nothing. When I booked this hotel, or it was a mistake for me in my life, you know why, the first person who entered the room was surprised by a room that is less space than the picture of the room that I booked and the strangest thing is that I contacted the receptionist. A room of two beds because we are young and after arguing for ten minutes, he told me he will see that there was a room and after about two hours passed the room was changed but unfortunately the room is wide but the bathroom is very small in addition to something strange happened with me I went out and walked and when the room came back at dawn I tried To open the room door with the card, then A it does not open, so my friend came down to the reception, so the same Arab employee charged the card and when he came back, we tried to open the room, and it did not open again, and he said, I will come with you to see. I found out that the door was broken and then we went to sleep, and then we went out at noon from the hotel. You saw me, I didn&#39;t live there. Thank you.
I wish I could no longer read this account for a time that passed from far away .. It simulates and expresses the time of Colette Khoury, and walks you and commits a certain age to a revolutionary path and his dreamy life ... I do not remember whether it was her autobiography or days with the days ... I was pleased that I returned with it to A time ago, Colette was studying my mother at the university, and at that time she was a taboo writer when I was a childhood .. I wished that I would not read it again because I remember that it is a novel other than a form, in which I now see an ordinary novel in a regular style, and regular romantic expressions ...
With safety and delinquency, and my opinion, say it, because you were the cause of a painful struggle between me and his supposed page. They would be saved with me in two hours. To speak the novel. Boss first, we raise our campaign again and start my words, is not enough for any remaining tattoo? . It does not mean that the writer is a new singer, we are encouraged, we encourage him, we apply it, and we do his concert on the novel with the blinding of our eyes on all the criticism that the writer fell in. Come, Nubus, from the first of which is supposed to be a police novel, whose idea was faded in fifty Arabic novels and films before that, it lacks suspense and the arrangement of events of course with the deadly drought From the language and style of the novel, which resembles a preliminary draft of a failed scenario to make a movie that does not intend to succeed, the idea of the novel is beautiful, and we cannot admit it. The first thing you get rid of is the first page, you will understand who the murderer is, and after that it will remain just a faded curiosity, that you understand his murder, but what do you worry about? You will know the motives and the way in the second page along Description of events and the reaction of each hero or every character leads to confusion, meaning that you do not understand the imposed sense of personality, what you do now and do not feel that you are living with it. The style of the narration is poor in all respects, which can make the narration successful. I hope that I am shocked by the smooth connection of events, and that I find the narration the same as what is written about it even once: / But no good at night .. My evaluation is no more than a star in honor of the fatigue of the nerves of the pen, the ink, the printed copies, and the delegation of the idea The sweet is not like that. A final request: enough for a doctor: / Thank you
One star for Muhammad and the other star for his effort, clearly with a narration full of stuffing .. I wished in clips that he dwell instead of returning the boredom as if he wanted the reader to feel really bored on the other hand Muhammad&#39;s style changed a lot In all respects .. I am not bored, even though she accompanied me in different cities, but every time I read a chapter in which I cannot complete the novel
very bad . nothing. everything
She is supposed to be a star and half. ..... Very ordinary deals with a very ordinary story ... nothing new. . Some people are cities, and some cities, when we leave it, do not have the right of return
good . The price is very adequate and the place is great. Cleaners
My first reading to Adonis, and it will be the last, of course .. One of the worst books that I have read is text, content, style, and dirty ideas ... And frankly, I could complete them from the many atheism in them .. I regretted my acquisition of the book I want to burn it:
Place capacity. The size of the rooms and the number of bathrooms. Furniture is old, regular colors, main toilets are narrow
star. For the time lost her vertebra
The second reading of Al-Aqqad after Sarah’s account. Akkad as a narration style remains unchanged in this book from Sarah, a method that relies on heavy, discreet sentences and words that you cannot easily digest. For me, it is impossible to finish a book on the contract in two days or days. This is in terms of the style of Akkad, but in terms of what came in the book from the analysis of the attitudes of the Prophet, whether they were political, war, and religious life situations, the contract was according to issues and was unsuccessful in other subjects. Topics related to the establishment of the Prophet and the signs of Mawlid were successful in it and they contained new information added to me. The issues related to Muhammad&#39;s military genius are always the thorny one. When talking about the Prophet, unfortunately, Akkad was not convincing to me. He relied only on comparisons and moved away from logic. The special chapters on Muhammad, the husband, the father, and the master, the second text of the book according to Akkad, showed the human aspects of the Messenger in a very distinctive way. Perhaps the special part of polygamy was excluded, but otherwise the second half of the book was wonderful and better than its predecessors in stages. The book is not a bad book, not a great book is between this and that
Acceptable . . The internet does not have a range hood, the toilet has a bad toilet, the window is blocked by billboard, looking out the room.
A very exaggerated book in my view
The worst types of stories are those that give the impression that they are indeed a story, made up and unable to convince the vitality of their characters and their positions, and this is what I sensed while I was reading the novel.
Poor hotel. Breakfast is suggested for there and a pill tomorrow. The rooms are narrow and have no toiletries such as napkins, shoes to enter the bathroom, and the drinks served are poor
A hotel that does not deserve a star. There is no . Close the beach and the garden early in the evening, close all the lights of the hotel, and parking is very narrow. Disrespect of the hotel staff with the guests.
However, the number of pages of the book is not more than approximately. However, you will not be able to finish it as quickly as you expect. Every story in the group is a great meal ... even though I hate exaggeration in symbolism ... or the stories that I feel after finishing that I need to go to ask the author himself what he means ??. I remembered Yusuf Shaheen&#39;s films, which receive many awards ... and when I watch, I do not understand them. . The stories of Naguib Mahfouz in this story are of the type that the stories of philosophers call. A number of which you will enjoy .. and raise questions in your head ..?. I love the story whose group was named .. The Secret Organization
My point is that classifying the book is supposed to be a novel because it is not possible to classify it as a novel absolutely a need, too, is that the idea of the book is not impressive, but the really distinguished thing is the psychological anatomy of the characters in the verbs and their contradiction in many times when there was creativity to convey the image and sense to the reader next to the soul The youth in the book
Nice stay. Good treatment, reception was excellent, employee Majid was excellent. The internet is not fast and not free
Injustice, power ... are two sides of the same coin. I like to think of them as events that are not inspired by a real story.
Resort is not a hotel. nothing. Cleanliness and hotel are not suitable for family
The Anatomy of the Revolution tries to read the political and social tensions that precede the revolution, and the changes that follow to overthrow the authority, then the extremists took over to rule and the following events ... It talks about the four revolutions: the American, French, Russian, Bolsheviks, and the civil war in England .. This book introduces the revolution as a state of pathological fever that begins with escalating symptoms, then illness accompanied by delirium and the rule of revolutionaries who are more violent, and ends with the recovery period and what follows from the patient’s recovery .. It is not a smooth book .. It needs many previous readings in the dates of the aforementioned four revolutions ... Oh
Muslims who want to reform should be convinced with their hearts, not with their tongues, that there is nothing in their religion that keeps them from importing reform from abroad.
Very weak. . The receptionist asked them for a double sister and they gave me a room with two separate beds
The story is painful, and no one can help but sympathize with the desired wealth, but the novel is directed to force you to hate the evil characters superficially without justification, which made me lose my sympathy for Soraya. The same thing I found in the novel My Name is Nujoud: I am ten years old ... and divorced, as the novel does not give any thought to any character other than the unjust heroine of work.
business trip . Receptionist Shehab El-Masry is very helpful and up-to-date. The housekeeping employee was very annoying Egyptian I do not remember his name but I do not recommend leaving him alone in the room
A satirical book, in its basic edition, that discusses a social problem that is sensitive to Egyptian society, but :. Why is colloquial, not classical Arabic? More than one point deserves serious discussion from many angles. Examples of advanced grooms were limited and lacked serious discussion. In the end, the book may be considered an acceptable initiative to discuss sensitive societal matters in an atmosphere of irony and comedy to reduce the impact of the black truth. It out.
What it was written by Atheer Abdullah is not novels, they are only literary texts. We can call it anything but a novel. The novel has different elements. Media and promotion have nothing to do with the value of fiction.
poor . nothing. The staff is extremely rude and unhelpful
The novel is realistic and it talks many needs that really exist in our society ... it was good, but for me, there was no trace in it. My difference is always with you at the end Once I read you a novel and its end is saturated and satisfied. But I am very satisfied with your love, there is no dispute
A light book, small, sarcastic and very enjoyable. He&#39;ll be saved with you quickly, but you will really laugh hard. I have a camel and my needs hung up with me a little and all I think about her laugh. The book, although it is satirical and comical, but unfortunately it shows the needs of the country, society and people that make you truly sad about what we have received. Bring your time to be honest .. Sadness needs something that will ease it, even relatively
The hotel has nothing to open the closest soul. I only loved its proximity to the sanctuary. The hotel is worn out, the corridors are crowded with placemats, preparing for pilgrims
Very weak. . Firstly, I did not live in the hotel, I booked everything, and I could not reach the hotel and asked a lot about it, but they did not know the location and called the hotel and tried to describe the employee to me the place and what he knew I tried to drive to the place what I was able to come back. There is no time in the hour for real parking lots on our side, so there are no parking spaces. I went to a second hotel near the campus with modest services. They have parking in real and thank you ....
Unfortunately, among the novels that I felt that my time was wasted on it ... The novel contains a group of other stories ... Her story with Majid and the answers and his injury to the fracture is very clear that it is excerpted from the novel. . It is clear that the writer is very influenced by the style of Abeer and Ahlam&#39;s novels, and this is very clear in a strange way in this novel. There is no balance in the novel working on a specific part, which is halal love and other aspects, and I have not met it frankly ... I wish it was at a higher level than that ..
This book literally made me headaches because of the many confusing and strange information in it that stops the mind and re-read it and try to classify it. I tried to search for some of what was mentioned in the book in the Google search engine, but I did not reach any result remember, let alone match it to what the author mentioned, maybe I did not search correctly or that this information does not exist, or I should be skeptical about it. The book was characterized by exaggeration, and pictures of the space people in the way that American films depict, exactly if there were residents of other planets who may not necessarily be like the image imposed on us .. Then what about the space helmets? If they are more developed and advanced than us, they will have their own technologies that are not necessarily similar to ours, such as helmets, ships, planes and clothes. The book included some pictures of antique drawings that support his words, but it made me confused. For example, I pondered a long time about one of the drawings that the writer says is for a woman with a hairstyle and who wears socks and pants. In general, the author reckons his fertile imagination .. For me, everything that I read must pass the balance of the Qur’an and the correct prophetic Sunnah. In the Qur’an there is no mention of rational creatures created by God, but the angels, humans, jinn and the last two are the ones charged with. If we assume that there are inhabitants of other planets, and this possibility may be possible, then it is not a miracle of God, then they will not be but among these three. Unless they have their own messengers and books and we cannot talk about what we do not have knowledge .. Also why is the distant assumption that whoever came from heaven are aliens, they may be angels, and angels have knowledge that we do not know, as it was stated in the Qur’an that the two angels Harut and Marut have They went down with the people of Babel, teaching them magic to have a temptation, and there are many signs that indicate the descent of the angels and embody them in human beings .. Why is also the other assumption that our human race is unable to develop its own civilizations without the intervention of aliens? Humans who have come to this development in this era are not unique in their kind, and there must be throughout the history geniuses and scientists have come to more than what modern man reached from the sciences, and those sciences have disappeared, including alchemy, alchemy, alchemy and others. Let us take into consideration that the ancients were their longest ages, reaching hundreds of years, and have a long time to learn, develop, teach, and reconstruct the earth, but this is God’s year in his being, nations appear, prevail, degenerate, fall out, and appear. Others do not know much about their predecessors, and so on .. Generally the book makes you think and research a lot.
A hotel for pedestrians. Breakfast is very overpriced riyals. Room location and street nuisance
And if it was beneficial, not even a single star, a semi-transmitted beginning from the movie “Taming a tiger” by Al-Bani Abdul Aziz, then it exposed a superficial religion to an atmosphere of Abeer novels for teenage girls, and the atmosphere of Nadia the soldier and the war of spies from the other.
A revolutions are not always inclusive, expressive of society as a whole, nor fair .. They may be factional, class, or ideological demands, for example what is happening in Thailand now, and their demands are not always fair or reasonable and may be against democracy in some cases by exclusion and intimidation, it is in The end is an expression of the demands of a part of society, and not all of society has less or more in number and proportion in the state. B revolution, in general, is not the only way to change, and there are other ways to change and reform. C revolution may turn into a separate obsession, desire or passion, regardless of the community&#39;s need or reading the reality. D revolution is an ongoing process in the sense of change, not in the sense of demonstrations and clashes. Is it necessary to dismantle the concept of the revolution itself: What do we mean by the term revolution? Is it a people&#39;s uprising against power only ... or is it a broader concept than that on the socio-political level and not on the individual level. Is the officer the number that went out in demonstrations, for example? Or is it the type of claims and the desired change? Or is it geographically expanded to include a greater number of cities and geographical regions? Then the most important question:. What is it based on? What is based on our agreement that the people really came out of a revolution after we defined and defined its conditions? Is every revolution obligatory to meet its demands legally and constitutionally? Or is there a legal and constitutional cover required for the demands of any revolution? New notes: February:. The author is not an academic and only. I remembered from Ressala&#39;s book On the Way to Our Culture that orientalists were studying Muslim societies and presenting the results of their studies to the rulers of the West so that they could direct them to what they wanted. And our author is not far from that. Trying to study the paths of revolutions and model them is nothing but an intelligence effort to guide and transform any revolution in the bud in the bud in the form of what serves American interests. And the twentieth century is full of examples of this ending with the Arab Spring. The second important note. It is the Iranian revolution as a model of a complete revolution opposed to the American interest at the time of its establishment. And I had started her study in an analytical study to know how the revolution managed to control the joints of the state and get rid of the old system as a whole and neutralize the army and police and the judiciary or control them quickly. Unfortunately the project was not completed due to the security prosecution. First article link:. : //. . / / .... The third note:. It is the growing role of the media and television channels in general year after year and decade after decade. What Abdel Nasser, Hitler and Mussolini used to say in a sermon inflaming the masses backed by measures on the ground buying the friendliness of the masses such as agrarian reform, for example, or the external threat or the call of ancient Roman nationalism, for example, in the case of Mussolini. New leaders have not prepared for all of this. Suffice them with a conspiratorial inflammatory speech focused by the media led by experts of moral guidance through studying the masses and their behaviors. Unfortunately. It appears that the awareness of the masses in general has not developed sufficiently to meet the development of moral guidance methods. They will respond to me, saying that it is the conscious youth and the university students who are leading the opposition to the coup now. I always say young people are the fuel for revolutions. As it happened in January. But they can not manage the helm after overthrowing the system. Or do not have a vision for the post-revolutionary wave. As long as elites and party and community leaders remain captive to old perceptions and ideas. No revolution is completely victorious. I invite you to know what is happening in Thailand and Ukraine now. As examples of failed revolutions in their demands and awareness. In the end, the difference between the true and comprehensive revolution and the factional uprising and narrow popular demands is in seeing this change revolution and the breadth and depth of its demands. What happened in January was an uprising with limited demands. People want to improve conditions. Activists went out against the security crackdown. Islamic currents went out to support the Sharia and enable it to a greater degree. And the revolutions in general that Crenten studied in his book do not fall outside this framework. Most of them were the revolution of the marginalized and oppressed classes against other classes, and thus in the exchange of roles between the classes and some of them. A comprehensive revolution is a revolution that has a clear vision and ideology for reforming conditions in general in the whole world. Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, came up with a revolution from this framework. Islam itself was, is, and will continue to be a revolution against tyranny and slavery when Allah the Exalted, the Majestic. The last and most important note in my opinion was considered the will of a war-weary combatant. The conflict is global and so to speak. Not with Sisi, with a military council, or with kings here and there. This does not mean adopting the option of carrying weapons, for example, on the Al Qaeda method. But. Our knowledge of the depth, breadth and coverage of the problem. It makes us better able to guide it and awareness of its dimensions. How many aborted projects because of the lack of awareness and the most prominent example that brings me to mind is that Morsi came to Sisi himself, so I have no explanation except for the lack of awareness .. And in the past the Brotherhood came to Abdel Nasser as well. The revolution must be directed against the real enemy. Awareness first, then to stop cognitive bleeding and mental and intellectual distortion, which they are leading a craft and perform. Then, by adopting the opposite action, let us get out of the circle of reaction and aborted dreams. I borrow this paragraph from an article I recently read for a Syrian writer named Ahmed Daadouch:. Finally, we realize that evading the global Protestant Jewish conspiracy will only take place with a counter plot that possesses the same ingredients, and is woven with the same savvy, and looks at the conflict from a perspective that expands to the whole world and extends for centuries to come, and is based on the intentions of Shari&#39;a gradually when necessary, and realizes that the declaration of a Sunni Islamic state in Any country on the ground today will push the Arabs and the West to fail it before it ripens ...
I do not recommend this hotel we were lucky because we stayed in the hotel just in the afternoon because we were waiting for the flight date. As soon as we entered the lobby, we saw a couple dressed in Manama and watched TV. The rooms were separate, dirty and noisy. The air conditioning unit was making a loud noise, and we had to turn it off and we couldn&#39;t open the windows because the loudspeaker on the mosque across the street was loud. There was a restaurant, but it was closed. Hotel staff seemed to want help. The bathrooms had face graphics on the wall. Do I need to say more?
The book is a summary of Muhammad Shahrour&#39;s thought. Unfortunately, the book has many flaws, which the author and publishers could have avoided. One of them is that the book is without a clear introduction, sequence, or methodology. The book is an excerpt from the previous doctor’s books and articles that were compiled randomly, cut and pasted without any modification, margins or sources. For example: While presenting a specific point, he says, and we will separate this point later in this book, then you will not find a detail in the same book. Because this phrase was written in another book, and the point in that book was actually detailed, but here it was past the publisher when he cut and pasted the paragraph from the old book to delete the phrase from this book. Likewise, many spelling and typographical errors, even in the verses of the Qur&#39;an, indicate that the book did not have the slightest level of review and scrutiny before publication.
I expected to find specific debauchery as I had heard about it. : / I will write a long review, God willing, blame on the lack of time
An intense dose of absurdity and boredom ... a novel that is extremely frustrating, for despite the magnificence of the idea, the handling, narration and literary style spoiled it ... At times I felt that I was reading newspaper articles and not a coherent novel .. It was better in my opinion to address the idea in the form of a story Short, but the idea and the verses of Abnudi and the last pages of the novel forced me to give it two stars.
Corporate Hotel. The location is a bit .. the hotel is not necessarily a star category, the carpet is not clean, the hotel feels it&#39;s intended for companies and meetings, not a high class for luxury and entertainment.
Something in the novels of Naguib Mahfouz does not attract me. When I read to him, I am often driven by this great legacy of fame and the hustle and bustle that fills the world, so enthusiasm takes me at first, but soon I get bored after a few pages and fade enthusiasm. This is the second of my experiences among the pages of Naguib Mahfouz, but with full respect to the international writer, I find much more pleasure when I read to fellow novelists, such as Bahaa Taher and Tawfiq Al-Hakim.
Maria&#39;s diaries, originally taken from the science of passion, are the best of the novel
Nice experience and great stay. The restaurants are excellent.
Dissolved in it, a great learner, and God ... But Nesbali is a rotten narration
Failed. . Failed
I took two very dirty apartments and the furniture was bad. There is no.
Weak. . The hotel furniture is very old
The book represents a historical account of some pre-Islamic and other events .. Some events have been repeated in it, and in my opinion the possibility is great that it will cause boredom to the reader who is reading it for a purpose that has nothing to do with research or the like .... In fact, I did not find a relationship between the title and the content The book, and that may be the result of lack of focus in some sites during reading, but despite that it is a beautiful and exciting work for an Indian person looking into Islamic matters .. After finishing it, the question remained hesitating again in my head: See .. what he lost The world with the decline of Muslims? ,,,
I do not think that the Sunni-Shiite conflict is caused by the biggest struggle between realism and idealism ... Where is the Sunnis of realism and where are the Shiites from idealism? . The qualities of realism and idealism do not apply to either of them. Realism means rationality and objectivity, and the Sunnis do not know anything about it, just as the Shiites do not know anything about idealism .... If none of them were rational or idealistic they would not fight all these centuries and They shed all this blood
Strawberry cheesecake has a little taste of cheese and whipping cream, and strawberries are just red. /
Too bad I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. I had already booked two years ago and it was now appropriate to lose my stay. the breakfast. Positions. the beach. Swimming pool .. The villa is very dirty with mice. The furniture is very old. The ground is dirty with dust. The pictures on the site are not true.
Acceptable . Its proximity to Burjuman metro station. Cigarette smell in the rooms even though we chose a non-smoking room, the beds are not clean
The important thing is that I have been walking for a while now. I blunder in psychological terms every time. Even when I love to read a novel, you talk about a kind of mental illness to obsessive .. beautiful .. Since I was in the stars I was guided by stars or less. While I was reading rural revieves of the novel, I discovered that the writer is often the wonderful second wife who described her in her malevolent novel. While .. stupid superficial trivia afflicted with a severe obsession in following her life is the first wife? If it were true. If she really meant this. The novel does not deserve any stars. This and our Lord guides souls, O group and God, and heal us all:
disappointing. The room is spacious, with water. The bathroom smells
I recommend it and I can stay there again. Breakfast was just good. The standard of cleanliness and luxury exceeds a maximum of 2 or 3 star hotels. Wi-Fi is out of time. They respond to contacts from the inside and from the outside rarely. The hotel in Saada is a very tired mountain by walking ahead, but they have provided transportable edges for most of the time. The bathroom is narrow and has a waterproofing.
It lacks some impartiality and objectivity, but it has a lot of logic and a lot if you disagree with it in many places. He did not reject Marxism as being anti-religious, but rather made loopholes in it that seemed logical to me. What he said about the Islamic economy, although it was wonderful, but it was not perfect, was not applied on the ground
Swimming pool cleanliness. The location of the hotel is excellent. The cleanliness of the swimming pool is not acceptable
Awful vacation nothing is worth the money. The food is terrible. There are insects in the room. The service is very slow. Managers are very rude and liars. They do not try to solve the inmates&#39; problems. The only positive thing is the sea. It&#39;s really cool. The park is good but you can find better service in similar hotels. Certainly the first and last time for me to approach this place.
I do not recommend the hotel. . There are cockroaches and the rooms are old
I myself was shocked, and I did not expect such corruption from the girls in Riyadh. And the novel is merely narrating scandals. It is better for a writer to be more conscious and try at least to assume a role of reformer or bite people.
I would not recommend staying at this hotel for those with a car. The beds are comfortable and the restaurant is dangerous to eat. Parking is not available to all guests, and the area outside the hotel is crowded, knowing that I have read the features of the room in Buchenk written. I would stay at this hotel again
disappointing. The staff are very welcoming and love to serve you, but they don&#39;t have anything. The location is almost more than a kilo, and the price is exaggerated for the hotel and for the location, there is only one restaurant nearby
I found it on Smart TV von a young man talking about the literature of Naguib Mahfouz in the film Naguib prepared by the Al-Jazeera Documentary Channel and it included critics, historians and personal friends of Mahfouz himself, so I remembered that I left a story series called the ghost of Anton Chekhov on the body shelf. At first glance, the title suggests a great effect that you might get, so I went to the fact that the ghost here is the spirit of Chekhov and its impact on the author and I started in a whirl of imagination, so I thought that the group has a distinctive literary nectar that will not cause the reader to lift his head off the lines but with the beginning of reading attack yawning then immortalize To sleep, contented by the average per capita consumption of boredom and the amount you got in your very ordinary day. The writer dedicates the work to his most famous friends, and divides his friends into my birth month: January, February, March etc., and a final story bearing the title of the group. But at the level of the event, we can divide it into: the unity of the family’s love, weakness and the might of pity, raving, the memory of the divorce, the nightmare of the past, and the female rebellion. We can also put a common slogan on the group&#39;s general theme: delirium. The writer is fluent in the use of Arabic, and this is a condition that must be met by any writer, but it is not the only condition. When reviewing in the December story, the page attributes he preserves that can describe the main character of prostitutes from dawn, promiscuity, and submission to the last dictionary that he listed without any need or justification fear For her hero to turn to those models, all of those attributes are listed in three pages are the same three pages that Chekhov wrote his important story, the fat and thin without any review or transfer of entire pages of attributes. But if we came to our last stop, we should look at the last story differently from all of the above. In the story of the obese and the skinny, which the author notes that she wrote opposing the obese and thin story that started at the Nikolai railway station, the main idea of Chekhov in writing it was the human nature, which Through it, and on three pages, pictures of what the rank and wealth do in two friends who were once one thing. We can know the value of the literary opposition through the poem Naguib Surur, which he started with you, those standing on the edge of the morgue, opposing the poem Amal Dongel, which he started with, you who stand on the edge of the massacre. His story when he opposed the religion of Chekhov who. Exclaimed when he saw his slender friend Loveri is it you? My dear, how many years have passed since I have not seen you? His friend, in astonishment, replied, &quot;Peace, Misha, childhood friend, where did you come from?&quot; Instead, he came with two mentally ill friends, one of whom pretends that he knows the other and the other does not know him.
The hotel is very uncomfortable in terms of the number of fingers and the car park. . Dislike the hotel, it is free of charge, the parking is far, and the lobby is small
Very weak. Location. Hotel amenities are poor. Cleanliness is bad
It is the first novel I read to Paulo Coelho and I hope that I make a mistake in my evaluation so that it is not the last. The idea of the story is beautiful, but. I don’t know whether the problem I encountered in poor translation or the translator’s style of presenting the story with his style is as if it is one of the topics of reading in our poor modern curricula linguistically correct but devoid of the spirit of language. And story plot. And I doubt that the problem is in the style of Paulo Coelho himself, otherwise he would not have gained such wide popularity. I hope I can choose a better writer next time
So it is an espresso story, not a novel .. short, shorthand, but good and smoothly written .. so realistic that it lacks wild fictional imagination .. give it / encouragement
Bad to the extent that I stand and ask: Why did you complete it ?. Indeed, why did I complete it? I don’t know .. maybe not really bad, but it is annoying ... it is not rational or logical and it does not contain convincing evidence .. justification, justification, justification ... why veil Arwa. The professor proposes an idea that obscures his daughter, who is less than fifteen, and who confirms that she is a child to take a decision like this, except that he is proud and joyful that she made this step ... I mean, a contradiction on the one hand who wants the veil to be her personal decision, on the one hand he says that it must be affected With the debt that we raised on him, and he says that she is a child who is not yet empowered to know things, so she must follow the Sunnahs of her mother and her sister who are veiled in advance ... Why a woman, not a man. Here, the professor is trying to convince the girls why they are wearing the veil, is not this injustice for them .. But because he does not find anything suitable to convince us with it ... he says it simply: It is how you like it, you do not like it. ??
Expulsion from the apartment. There is no. The apartment is not comfortable before the completion of the hour at noon, the last day, I was asked to call to leave as soon as possible, as well as the attendance of the staff of the room, urgently requesting the evacuation of the apartment.
So bad, please amend. . The first meeting and reservation
The book is beautiful in terms of its subjects, but it made a bigger noise than its size, especially since the writer&#39;s style was very contradictory.
First, I do not like the sincere style of writing, prolonging excess of necessity, and workers answering similes and stacking a few sentences, all of them having the same meaning in the other ... the topic was more abundant, and God willing, all of them with different cultures spoke the same language and the same fluency. As for juveniles, he remained in the burning of juveniles in the countryside, in need of many convincing things, which are permanently avoided. And the whole novel is based on very strange coincidences, convinced of her frankly, her sensuality. . I was reading it, hoping that in the end, there would be a surprise or need that would endure me for all that was apart, but unfortunately, the novel ended with a worse end than its beginning .. And in the end, I did not know what happened to his twin sisters, and there was no reason for their disappearance and no need
Well this is a book read in the series. Perhaps it was supposed to conclude with it. The book revolves around the reason for writing letters, the reason for his war for catching phrases and selecting vocabulary..the reason for boiling blood is hot in his letters not only in his veins..it is love..love in God and perhaps some love is pain. To start with, I found the book boring except from the luxurious language of Al-Omari ... until love impressed me in God .. Love in God as described by Al-Omari not as the rants of the religious and beard-bearded .. until she yearned to love in God and God .. The part that talked about the divine court attracted me On the authority of Malik and about our personalities represented in various scenarios .. When I was shaken in fear, I raised my head to turn the page ... to find it there ... that which is always there ... Rahman Rahim, Glory be to Him ..
How to spoil a wonderful movie for everyone in the late nineties and early years of the new millennium, the British group produced an unprecedented documentary series on life on the planet in prehistoric times, which brought about a completely new breakthrough in the field of documentary films that followed dozens of films and episodes Documentary after that. The series was great and revolutionary in everything .. production, thought, vision, and computer influences .. And it bore a major title:, followed by more than one description according to the historical era .. that dealt with the story of life before the age of dinosaurs, followed by B, then, and finally This is the exact historical arrangement of the series, not the release date. The most important and most successful parts of the era were the dinosaurs, especially since it appeared in the era known to those interested in the field of fossils as the awakening of the second dinosaurs, which was started by a group of modern scientific discoveries that turned our attention completely towards these wonderful creatures. The new animation movie shares the L series in the name, production and subject matter, but it differs artistically in everything from what was presented brilliantly in the past. With Hollywood as a 20th century Fox Studio enters as a major production partner, the whole business has gone completely wrong. In the original series we watched a fascinating display of the daily life of dinosaurs, from their debut timidly more than a million years ago, through their full domination of the Jurassic era, and ending with their great extinction in the Cretaceous period a million years ago. All this with an informed, educated, and informative voice commentary, uniquely blending science and art and imagination. Everyone was waiting for the new movie to go in the same way, but it might take it to broader horizons and horrific stages .. Especially with the development of technology it has become possible to provide dinosaurs as we have not seen them before .. In the film, we follow the huge annual migration of a flock of th Bakirinosaura, a herbaceous dinosaur with a long skull spanning four prehistoric northern regions of Canada. The scenario was destined to show the events in the style of Al, that is, a documentary film in a narrative cinematic form .. We were supposed to watch this natural epic in a sober documentary worthy of it. This is before the producers finally change their minds and take the movie in a completely different direction that will remind you of the ridiculous cartoon movies we see on TV, especially those aimed at children as young as years old. Fox of the twentieth century, producer of the film in the last stages of production, changed its plan from a discreet documentary with a fictional character to a family film intended mainly for children, and for this made all the animals in the film speak .. and the result was: complete failure. A hybrid movie that you cannot enjoy its seriousness, nor are you able to indulge in its humor, especially with provocative sounds .. Instead of seeing dinosaurs interacting with each other through roaring, snarling, bellows, and loudness ... we were forced to listen to disturbing conversations that did not stop For one moment throughout the events .. Add to this that the animals&#39; mouths never move, just listen to their thoughts. A group of young Hollywood actors was chosen with voices without distinction and does not offer any pleasure Justin Long in the lead role. The dialogue itself was written in a very disturbing way ... with a very contemporary American joke and ... which will make you wonder: Is this what is going on in the minds of prehistoric dinosaurs? It is the most ridiculous thing that you can see at all .. And to torture further, the filmmakers did not make their dialogue stop for a second to breathe or ease the viewer&#39;s mind, but it continued to be sticky, silly, and annoying throughout the events of the film even in the most dramatic moments ... which It will make you ascetic in the first third hour, and you will try hard to dampen the sounds in your head in any way and enjoy the image only, but without any success in reality. Now what about the soundtrack accompanying the events? Which is supposed in a movie that shows one of the most important major migrations that took place in history to be epic, or at the very least poetic, that puts you in the air that does not take you away from it .. but hey .. here you will listen to a group of the most ridiculous contemporary American songs that vary between Rock, pop, and hip-hop .. and let the air go to hell .. let&#39;s spoil this to everyone in every possible way. One thing you&#39;ll enjoy in the movie is the stereoscopic show ... the one that came out very solid, and very cool. Otherwise, you will come out of the theater with a strong headache, and the remnants of disturbing sounds that keep coming inside your head .. The movie has met with a huge failure in theaters, especially with fierce competition with other animation films that provided real art as your example, where he has achieved so far within America a million Only dollars. All in all, I have taken the wonderful Hollywood L that everyone loved and turned it into something ridiculous and very vulgar, this is a movie that will not love more children in dinosaurs, but may make them wander with love and feel the absurdity of their unique hobby. Special advice: Do not go for a walk with the dinosaurs in the theater .. And if you want to see another wonderful movie about dinosaurs going on in the same place prehistoric Alaska, and deals with the same types of dinosaurs, but with a great deal of greatness and splendor, I recommend you the amazing documentary. Or you can wait a little while the movie&#39;s Blu-ray is released, a version of it will be available without those ridiculous sounds, and also with accompanying different soundtracks .. Only then, you will be able to enjoy your dinosaurs dearly as it should, if you are obsessed with it like me.
A very short novel full of descriptive details of the place and things, until I almost got lost on the strange and somewhat frightening theme of the novel.
Unfortunately, the service is not suitable for the hotel. The service is very bad. The mattress is full of stains and is not clean and two hours are sitting to change the mattress very bad service
A light book that works as a first reading experience..the author tried to compliment the Arabs as much as he could and alluded to the real reason for their disappointment as he saw it I wished more frankly than the author
I liked her start. And the hero&#39;s ability to read facial expressions is more of a love. But in many of the events, there is no need for anything other than necessary words. Ahmed Murad is a great writer in terms of photographing scenes and taking your mind with him. But to be honest. I regret that I read it very In the end, each one understood it differently. Feel that you come, very seriously concluded. As well as once, I stop my reading and say, I will not complete it, but curiosity is a monster
I don&#39;t encourage him
It contains something from our reality, we girls, women, women, and what is remarkable is that it is an unchanging reality. What I mean is that it is a book from many years ago, but when you read it, you feel that it touches your reality now ... we are still. We are all young, angry women .... and it seems we will stay ...
The novel is missing bonding. But I glimpsed a faint beam between her pages that carries a sublime message that the author was unable to photograph
Hotel below the expected standard. Nothing but the place. Breakfast buffet is not even. Cleaning is unhappy and room service is unhappy
I was disappointed in the novel, I did not expect it with this boredom ... As a story, not an interesting story, at the beginning it was exciting, but it faded until boredom, from its castle to a prison, the darkness of no satisfactory food, they go out to work and return ... and every time they fall one after the other as if I read that novel The brilliant darkness .. I thought the end would be joyful .. full of feelings of joy and madness, but he stamped it with a slap, it really came back and came back, but without showing the momentum of the great feelings that occur when meeting loved ones after a separation that lasted a year. Generally, this is what concerns the story ... The character of Hanna Yaacoub was devastating and does not inspire optimism and pain. He was passive and does not inspire life for you. I think that he was very fortunate in his success only. The other characters overwhelmed him so much that you wonder where are we? Why is it not really the focus of the story is the beginning and the end only .. And there is stuffing in the novel a lot I did not like ... Ok, why are the two stars? :. In fact, he excelled in describing places, homes, cities, and food as well, as was the pilgrimage journey that was beautiful .. There is wonderful historical political information .. I believe that if he made this trip in a format other than sadness and prison literature it would have been more worthy, and because of the prison literature we have seen him move from tragedy to prison To a castle with the same feelings .. a boring repetition .. I only wait for when it will come out and fall into another castle ... It is not my habit to write a review .. But the feelings of discontent with the poker-winning novel prompted me to do so.
Weak. . The smell of the rooms and the hotel is very bad
Were it not for the points, I would be sad, my husband and child traveled last month for a two-day treatment trip that I used instead of cash. The hotel in terms of the place is bad, the region is part of it is tourist and part of it is very poor and this hotel is located in the poor place, the cleanliness is excellent, but the hotel itself is very old and not renewed transportation. There are metro feet from the hotel, but the taxi to the Champs-Elysées took about a euro and a minute
Weak. Breakfast was paid so my breakfast was outside the hotel. Cleanliness is poor and there are old floor brushes
disappointing. The level of the hotel is somewhat acceptable ... .... because of the location only to change .... and breakfast is good. Open buffet. I booked twice the first time in the name of my Emirati friend. Things were good. Location of the room opposite the golf course and lake ... The second reservation was my name .... the look is very bad in the first floor .. the services in the room are incomplete .. for example .... irons and the table ... as well as bathroom services except when contacting them are brought shampoo and shower gel and lotions and shaving tools and toothbrushes . FW, etc. Reservation through the hotel The price and through you Dirham And if the reservation is through you from the internet, you do not have a room with views ... You have the worst location and this is the second time you get with me in Muscat and because in Abu Dhabi
Somewhat . . The furniture is out of date
Completed you don&#39;t like me. Firstly, the questions are de Petigi Ali, whoever thinks about and uses his mind and the responses to it are not convincing, convincing, because in his questions, you will prefer not to answer questions.
Somewhat disappointing ... the theme of the novel is traditional
The story, I can tell light on her village, once, ..... I liked the realism in it ... good luck
The strangest thing you find on the page of this novel is the conflicting reviews in a striking way between Mahqr and most of this work, which, if anything, indicates that the opinions are affected by each other. I see that it is a work well below the average, as you do not come out of the novel with nothing but the irony of the superficiality of the hepta itself, this name that he developed to add a non-existent depth and general floating titles that include any interpretation that leads to whatever detail he wanted. The novel plays on the feelings of a novice reader who does not know the taste of real novels and his delusion that he lived one of the stories, which made him live with it despite its surface and deludes himself that the writer touched part of his personality. The reason I read the novel after a time of its descent is because I knew that there was a cinematic work for it and that I would return to talk about it.
Finally finished .. The first quarter of the book is very beautiful .. Then it descends, it descends, makes you feel bored, makes you grudge on the category of all men, so you have to be immune, otherwise you will actually hate this sex and consider it a calamity that walks on two men. The idea of the book is nice .. and its beginnings are very useful .. if only it would continue as it began. I will give him a star for the first quarter and a star for the pledge written in the last pages of the book
After I concluded reading, I felt that I did not take advantage of any need, except that I wasted a lot of time, or if I was watching a boring and long movie. In his exaggeration of the description and repetition in a way that responds to boredom ... I did not want to complete the novel, but I completed it in the hope that in any sudden event this will not happen. Why exaggerate the description of sexual relations, which is far from the events and does not have any need ??? The exact description in Laila&#39;s body? The novel contains very linguistic errors and a lot of rhetoric, as the writer has very much information and needs to review his information ... Unfortunately the novel came out less than I expected.
A book that is very exaggerated in its flashiness
Very weak. . Failed Services Failed Rooms Failed Everything Failed Reception Failed and the photos shown in Booking are incorrect
disappointing. Close proximity to major roads and services. Utilities provided kitchen, restrooms, sterilizing covers, pillows, unsatisfactory and inconvenience inmates
good . Close to the Haram, the breakfast is delicious and good. Bad-watered bathroom meets sprinkler
Thank God it was concluded ..:. It is one novel, not two, and not a novel in some. Ok, who is with whom and who does what? Is Alsnjh .. not Alsrnjh ... or Alsarjh .... and not the Rosary ... nor the fence, or what? Ok, is Issam going to write the novel, how? Ok Ibrahim, where do you live? Ok, what happened to the castle, jumping the sea, I mean the revolution with the novel. a. Okay, who am I? The narration of Al-Tohaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan
There is no comparison, of course, between him and Nizar Qabbani, Farouq Juweidah or Ahmed Shawky .... but I just liked my needs and commented with me and made me laugh, and this is enough, because it is two stars
In Nessbali, it was a suspicious novel, which frightened me and frustrated me. My nerves: .. It is possible that I am afraid of a little .. It is not important .. Far from that, the novel is very normal .. It has more defects than features .. Its characteristics are scientific accuracy in psychological terms .. somewhat suspense .. but ... its shortcomings .. stretching and lengthening .. ambiguity .. verbalities in metaphors and descriptions in every scene .. in the needs of their understanding, such as successive numbers .. and linking history to the present on what basis? The end is not a very concept. Does Yahya have a mental disorder and delusions of being fancied? And no one touched him and worked with him as he did with Sharif?
You are not up to me. I never loved the main characters. And events are not connected. She walks slowly for a long time, then suddenly she jumps for several years. She finds the heroine desperate for this love, then suddenly she finds her seeking after him for no reason, then suddenly she finds her completely desperate. A very volatile character, I did not accept her actions, and I did not understand whether she was a stubborn or defeated character. And the hero, although he constantly tells her to live her life and forget him, he follows and intercepts her with strange resolve. For the truth I could not complete it
A bland and boring book and a bad example of.
The book as a genius idea. There was no denial that he made me burst out of laughter in many needs. And he rejected it, in long portions, so that there was no need. I don’t know much under it, I don’t like it. I just loved the book. Dana why did I bring him back .. By the way, even though I am a friend, unfortunately, I do not read this book pirated, and despite this cover, the book was sold for the first time. I accidentally pocket the book because I heard a passage on it on TV. I said try. The book in overall is good and the link is nice. Especially the topic that Munir nullifies riches. The idea is for you how =
I read the translated subtitles, the style of the writer is simple, easy, and urges to read, but the story itself is unfortunately descending, and I do not recommend reading it.
Very, very consumer. . The air conditioning is broken. The room smells bad. The water is too bad
disappointing. Its location next to Mall of the Emirates. High price for poor hygiene
. I don&#39;t see anything. I did not like it because the employee was not good style. I entered the hotel at one and a half hours and asked to wait until three in the afternoon until the hour of entry, even though there are rooms and you can enter me because I am coming from a travel
In the beginning, I would like to say I saw a teacher in a prayer so diligently. I love reading for you very much, despite some reservations, but the ideas and style of writing leave me very enjoy reading for you and let me live the atmosphere of the novel. I have stayed for the novel as an idea, hard, very beautiful, delicious, and easy style, but in some events it was monotonous and bored in a big way, and unfortunately I have a simple reservation, I wish you accept that you are biased towards the characters who are committed in a big way, uh, this is beautiful, that you try to get information or advice through the novels Your merchandise, but without bias, he entered and cooled himself, some boredom, the length of events and the agony, but the novel is very good.
The machine is so bad that it is not suitable for a person as it is your stature.
It is a three or four star hotel at best, but it is rated five stars on paper. The location of the hotel. The value is above the standard of the hotel
I admit that the novel attracted me even that I read it in one session and it amounts to more than four hundred pages, but I have some notes on it: I did not like political guidance throughout the lines of the novel. The writer insists on polishing Marxism through several pivotal figures in the life of the heroine of the story, such as the slave of the prison fellow, for example. Mr president . The stories and pornography are redundant, and the author described parts of the women’s bodies that are repeated many times ... the portent of Marwa, the husband of the minority son of the minority, and the army officer who refused orders to raise the boy&#39;s childhood companion to attack the prison of Palmyra. The army that is used to plunge into dangerous battles, to win over the rogue sect in this naive way will not do anything, I think that if the writer had been able to write the story in these days, I would reconsider this character ... digression or inherited my extreme boredom, writer digression plus and I noticed that he speaks About side stories almost ten Sik the main story in what I imagined was an increase in the pages of the novel, no more. Companionship in prison affected the heroine to a point that made her turn a degree in her thoughts and beliefs, so she left the prayer in prison and left it without a veil and no longer cares about him, just as she became drinking alcohol, all this effect is irrational to make her endure in prison all this time, because who believes in his ideas He is fiercely defended by whoever is able to remain in prison, whatever his orientation, while giving up ideas so easily it foretells of a defeated character who cannot continue to live life ... from racism and ridiculous stereotypes that Islamist women are portrayed with the image of the neglected woman for herself and her beauty, As the heroine was not caring for herself And for her appearance when she was in the group and after her release from prison she became concerned with her elegance and body. Another digression that I did not see any reason for is the story of the Afghan-Soviet war, which was reflected in the story on the character of Safa and her husband Abdullah ... It seems that the writer owns a good ignorance of Islamic movements when he writes that the heroine of the story owns books by Ibn Baz that she considered references to her knowing that she belongs The organization of the Muslim Brotherhood and the two groups have great differences. It bothered me that the author did not mention the heroine’s name or her mother’s name ..
One of the worst is the worst I&#39;ve read
Although I do not believe that. What went on. Will not be restored. The little that remains. Not worth the steps .. but I liked it. And he could end up at bothering for the rhyme.
The worst hotel I have ever lived in. Nothing I liked, but I am surprised by all the love of granting this hotel stars, but the blame is on the ministry of sleeping tourism, which has no effective role at all with the likes of this hotel. Everything reception does not give you any attention at all The level of cleanliness of the rooms is very C Breakfast is a buffet or all items are good for children or owners of accursed very cheap
I did not complete it, I did not finish it, or I made it back.
In general, there are no novels in the colloquial language, but there is no construction, no plot, and the idea is burned from the first pages of a novel for entertainment only. And consuming side conversations, such as good morning and how are you? Factor, thank God, only bored readers on a page.
The worst place for my travel. nothing. everything
Weak. . A furniture is very old, the furniture is old and worn out, the sofa is disgusting at the foot and dirty. It is forbidden to take high amounts on a very tired level and calamity. They say five stars are worth it. Three stars and less. I regret all my regret for this hotel, and the cheating pictures that are on the site apply to reality.
Weak. I did not like anything. He wrote that parking is available, but unfortunately, that only he has parking is available .. Delivery books to the House of God. Correct delivery to buses stops only, and it charges. No two entrances were identified and appeared but the room provided was filled with a smell of smoke. Internet only in the lobby. Cleanliness is zero
Rabie Jaber&#39;s problem is that he separates in a boring way. He does not feel himself writing and reciting. Cross the pages in a fatal way. The second star is for his name only, even though these things do not compliment him. Druze, Belgrade, is by far the best of books. The opinion is boring
I do not recommend it. The rooms are clean and equipped. The reception staff are not fit in a four-star hotel, the room is very narrow, the bathroom and the bathtub are very very narrow
An interesting start, and the atmosphere of the story generally draws you despite the little exaggerated details.
Not the best of what was written. The basement style was not a reason, and it is possible that I do not like this style
Book a family for adults and provide beds for children. . Lack of credibility to provide a family of the same size agreed upon
The hotel is quite good under conditions of crowds in Ramadan. I liked the proximity to the campus for a minute. Lack of wavy
disappointing. Close to the campus and breakfast. The service is bad and the cleanliness as well and there are insects
An unfortunate start with the Prince of the Secret, I could hardly finish it, tossed the book several times and made the busy and rushed back again, all I wanted was to put an end to this misery that smelled and the thorns that stuck with you as you traveled the distance behind the chemistry teacher who has a low salary and who is hostile to women But he falls into a naive and pleasant love that he only saw once to drag you in search of him from the poor neighborhood of Masaken who lives in the neighborhood of Al-Bustan, whose intuition foretold that his love resides in him, and then the tragic end that his life ended .. The truth is that I am not a fan of love stories. It was a sick, selfish, aggravating love that made you feel disgusted And aversion, I wonder why the hero spent his life like this and stopped it on an imaginary love, in return, he did not care to search for his brother who had disappeared for seven years and he certainly did not improve his conditions or change his life or communicate with his surroundings, negative scattered everywhere that makes you do not sympathize with anyone despite bad Circumstances and conditions, had this fictional story been judged to be a failed story but to be true, it is truly a disaster. As for style and language, they are good, but the novel is fraught with bored love permits of boredom, which has burdened the atmosphere very much alongside blackness and tyrannical boss, as if the hero lived two different worlds, the world of his lover&#39;s names, in which he locked himself in prematurely and satisfied, and the outside world that he could not and does not want to keep up with. Finally, I did not like her, but I hated her, and I find it difficult to get rid of her memory and the bad mood that she aired in, and I will certainly not recommend it to anyone.
The content is beautiful, but the way it is narrated and stuffing a lot
I will not repeat the visit to these apartments. Location only. The price is higher than it deserves, the bathroom door without a key, the kitchen is bad, old and worn out furniture and the cheapest kind of furniture. Smell the smoke in the reception.
You don&#39;t deserve a star, it is not a higher decision, because a new book came out better than a million times before reading it
The book, or rather the booklet, carries extracts from Mustafa Al-Rafii’s thoughts and words on various social topics, he started with an introduction about him and two articles in his praise and then attached chapters bearing his tweets, as his thoughts are short as tweets today, but the reader can seek sexual racism against women in some of his views ... Latifa is his words, but I did not see that genius and distinction as I read about him, it may be because of my weak poetic tastes ..
I will not repeat it . . Unfortunately, the treatment was bad, and they did not appreciate the inmates. They gave me a room I asked for. I came to terms with them.
The name of the novel is sweeter than the novel breath. It is not enough for the topic to be sensitive to the novel being influential ... I found the method very ordinary and the novel abridged more than necessary .. Most of the countryside say that the story is moving, but frankly, you did not feel anything about me and it never affected me: /
Too bad. . Failure to cooperate and cancel the reservation is confirmed, and there is no communication by a specific tool in this regard
Jihad al-Turbani is one of the Palestinian poets who write resistance poetry and this book is a tickle of the feelings of Muslims in light of the deterioration experienced by the Nation of Islam after it was carrying the torch for years if not centuries. The writer followed his writing on the British astronomer Michael Hart&#39;s approach to the book of one hundred most influential personalities, which he started by classifying the Prophet of the Nation of Islam, Mustafa Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, at the top of the list, where the latter tried to collect a figure throughout the ages and times that contributed to crystallizing the world today. And here came the idea of jihad, with only Islamic figures .. I do not hide from you that the book as an idea is a good gesture to introduce young people to Islamic personalities who have rarely heard about them, but there are some notes that raised me positive and negative as well ... What I liked in the book:. The style of suspense in the book, especially the passage between characters, by asking questions that raise the reader&#39;s desire to know the answer .. diversity between characters ... What I did not like about the book:. Restricting to the fighting and political personalities in most of the book&#39;s places and not mentioning one living science scientist, astronomy physics ..... or human sciences philosophy of sociology .... and the Islamic nation does not lack this kind of personalities especially in the golden period of Islam .. Errors Spelling that invaded the book in a strange way .. Thinness in style and repetition not to mention the use of words that are not worthy of a history book such as: the infidel heretic .... History sir al-Fadl calls for complete impartiality in the transmission of events attached to the sources .. the many questions raised in the late characters and Sometimes we find no answer or insufficient answer in places Others, and we can find justification for the fact that the book is limited to five pages, at most, per person. Frankly, I liked the idea of the book, so I bought the book without reading pages from it on the Internet, and it is my method in choosing books, but unfortunately, my misfortune, the book is advisable to be placed next to the children&#39;s family and reading to them whenever the opportunity arises but taking into consideration correcting spelling errors and deleting other phrases Decency, insult, and slander in personalities, and if they are incompatible with our ideology, then all of his mind thinks about him, and no writer has the right, regardless of the way, to use excesses and exaggerate his religion or doctrine on any other party.
A narration is less than Bktaiyiyyiyyer than what her village expected for one reason, because the famous sentence sold the passport of Atris from Fawadah invalid. The story is a collection of separate scenes, without any interconnectedness or dramatic plot, and the end was naive and priority. The worst story I have read so far
Deceive the customer. nothing. The customer deception upon arrival is surprised by the rooms completely different from the ones there are pictures in the Albuking very very old rooms and a very small shelf and there is maintenance in the hotel can not sleep treated the reception is very bad when I arrived from travel I booked a room for two people through the site So I went back to the reception to change the room, and he changed to the room at the same level and the inconvenience of about two hours.
Bad and unclean and a million insects and bugs. T. The hotel is not good, and I got a ridiculous experience. I booked a day. The level of cleaning is very bad. In the last days, he was in need of a pinch. Almost I contacted the manager in charge at dawn. He did not accept the room change. Tumor, and we called the hotel manager and did not need anything on the last day, and when I got to the receptionists to make a departure, then I spoke to them to complain to my collection and I passed them on my body and they did not accept the complaint and I told them.
It is not even worth going through from him the receptionist is uncooperative, the room is hot and when I reported the reception about the problem of air conditioning they brought me a small fan that reminded me in the days of the eighties, and when I decided to cancel the reservation they said I must pay from the reservation value for each day because unfortunately my nights barrier
It is impossible again that I was very disappointed as I visited all three star hotels near Hurghada and Sharm and it was better than this one called five stars. Since this was my two-week major vacation, I was very disappointed when looking at the pools. It looked great but it was frozen but the view was beautiful. The cleaning officials pulled the quilt over the bed only without arranging the sheets under it. I had to call the reception at six in the evening to request towels for the bathroom because they took it in the morning and did not replace it. Food was ok, breakfast was ok, lunch was ok, you had to book for dinner and yes there are around or restaurants but only two or three options in total and you had to pay for anything respectful. The bar was a joke unless you liked to dance to the Bonnie M band every night. The beach was awesome. I had to stay and meet some nice people. I wanted to go back and say it was great but unfortunately it wasn&#39;t. I think it was very big and I am used to a more personal service.
Actually, though, Hoda&#39;s review is very harsh, but regardless of this, she agreed with her in very many points. I do not need to repeat it. It is assumed that the novel is interesting, but I could hardly touch it except in a few points. Up to a quarter of the novel, it was assumed, for example, that Professor Naeem died in suicide. The novel ends with a surprise, and it contains something of decoding that I did not like. What does it mean that the numbers in the letter are numbers for Surat Al-Baqara, the second verse? What is the goal and what is the important detail in this? Many needs of the novel. And if I have a conviction rate with an idea that the writer wanted to clarify in general that the Jews control is by infiltrating the centers of power and penetrating them into sensitive positions so that they mainly control events, which justifies the Jewish lobby, for example, and the control of a terrible number of American Jews over the press, the media, and the centers of money and power .. You didn&#39;t like me =
In his rightness I could not finish it. There were periods that I liked the book, but boredom was always in the first stage ...
I did not like the end .. it is very pretentious .. this book can be summarized in a quarter of the number of newspapers .. many events have no benefit at all ... and you feel in the last book that the writer suddenly decided to finish it ... unfortunately I did not find it interesting to me
Very perfect, with many superficial parts, and the end was not as strong as it should be ..
A poorly spoken novel, boring in context, poor in content
Unfortunately, as far as zero star, this book is forbidden, it is classified as a book.
The scissors are not practical and have very bad results
A humble attempt to put some question marks. But a youthful experience, I hope it will spread
The hotel is too few to be rated stars ... no cleanliness, comfort and service. . The hotel is worn out
A star for Youssef Zidan&#39;s style, wonderful language, and a star for letters
Overall nice. The two best stories in which they are dressed and the machine countries that really have a great idea. The rest of them are nice, but not the terrible thing. Generally it is useful in acquiring short writing skills of its pioneer Youssef Idris
. . I hoped Ghada Kanafani&#39;s letters were present in the book.
Good, but ,, the language, narrative style, the goal, the woman, and the injustice incurred on her need more credibility.
In the stories I did not like, I mean, I hate her heroes. Because I can not imagine the surroundings of all people as bad. Despite the writer&#39;s warning in the introduction. In the stories, I felt that he would play more on his soul, champions more than the events themselves. Thus, I felt at times that the stories were truncated. I was always standing at the end of each story of them a little. Because I could not be convinced that this was the end of them
Pros: Easy, varied and varied menu, good staff, excellent sauces, excellent food service, continuous cleanliness of the place Negatives: High burger price for meat not fresh. The floor of the restaurant is unsatisfactory to consider because it is a concrete cast. Uncomfortable chairs, especially harmful for big weights. Some posters and drawings inside the restaurant repel some people, for example: a human-made burger drawing. Note: You can ask for an extra burger slice and it only costs you about riyals. I don&#39;t remember, and so you have a double burger at a better price than some burger restaurants who reject this idea. Rating: / This rating is on the burger restaurants level
not good . nothing. I counted for half a night after the hotel notified Bokeng without asking me, as I left at three o&#39;clock .. Be careful in your dealings with the priest, as the hotel management does not have any flexibility
Fasting is non-existent. the food. Aljmamm dislocated and for water intrusions in a droplet and light lights
Worst hotel. . Bad services, etc. The implementation of the service requires a long time and there are fees for parking and bringing the car requires an hour
Boring, except for the biography of Ibn Taymiyyah
I read it for my admiration in his book A third attempt, but this book .. Actually scattered papers in which he talked about Mrs. T I did not understand what he meant by that in the truth I did not like his papers here I see it shuffle as some say
Very audible, and not worth the money. I read the comments on the Trip Advisor and thought that this place looks great at this price ... but the rooms are very audible, so if your neighbor has a mobile phone ringing or when they speak you can hear them as they are cleaning with a vacuum cleaner Am, this is not a good mix.
Honest evaluation. The site is very close to the campus. Quite pricey
The lowest level in Ahmad Murad’s novels is the opposite of what I expected for her ... I need it then re-read the book of Exodus to Moses after what was written by Ahmed Murad to forget the mess up in the novel
. I liked nothing but a site. When the hotel found the amount was not agreed
Bad and expensive. nothing. everything
disappointing. . nothing
Two stars and I think very generous in the evaluation. Well, the novel sheds light on the pre-catastrophe period, the period of the Mandate and the penetration of the Jews in Palestine, it is clear that it relied on historical sources that were remembered in the margins to support the novel and the credibility of the image that puts us towards it. But ... I often felt very superficial, and very naive, while reading it. In her depiction of the suffering of the woman, the basic work corner was unsuccessful, and Dad ran away from Haifa to Jerusalem at Lisa, whom she had met once or twice and attends the women&#39;s demonstration, then simply and easily returns to her family .. Thus the social aspect in general was extremely naive and superficial. As for her portrayal of the revolution and the sheikh, it was totally unfair and abusive, although it could have reduced its value and size in a more logical way. The sheikh&#39;s dialogue with the lily was laughable in his absurdity. As for the language, it is simple without any distinction except when using the spoken dialect
I can say that I am able to withdraw and leave the novel at any moment, but I have completed it with almost one soul. Perhaps the philosophical sense separated what is this novel and intercessor to complete it ... I like from a page that explains the title of the novel originally
Network
The narcissist with the Kundera dictionary, is not arrogant. The arrogant person despises others, reduces their destiny, but the narcissist overestimates them, because he sees in the eyes of each of them his own image.
One of Dr. Ahmad&#39;s least books ..... I can’t understand what idea or what is meant by the book as a story is considered very acceptable serious but if in the intended idea of the book it really lost the way to my mind ... or I did not rise to understand it
break the routine . Staff and overhead pool. The car park is far from the entrance. A baby cot was only provided after urgent request, although it was included in the reservation requests. Nuisance of music until the end of the night.
At least, Munif did not create a long love story, and he persists in that..then he tries hard to make us sympathize with her in the name of love, like most of those who wrote on this topic..The only star for this reason ..
The introduction to the novel is very boring and long, and the novel is not very useful. The strange fantasy can not be understood
He is in need of his needs and he will be wonderful
Failed and substandard. Nothing even eating is not fresh. Everything in the hotel
The original version is by Rostan, and it has been translated, if correct, by Al-Manfalouti. Rustan is a French poet and has his own style, as does Manfalouti. The Manfaluti language is so great that it imposed itself in this narration to the extent that it erased any features of the original novel. I think a book with the greatness of Rostan and Manfalouti should be read to them individually, which is why the story did not motivate me.
About da dog and price. Oh peace so hard ?. Oh, God, your colleagues. He and Bassam went so far. Bassam bites. Try to answer a treatment. only. Oh, just
The smoothness of the book gives the ordinary reader unfamiliar with space science to enjoy what came and goes out after reading on a fair amount of knowledge .. but this book is useful to anyone looking in this field because he needs to develop according to the latest theories that change daily and at a rapid rate.
Too bad ... time was much better. . Nothing deserves praise ..
There is no management. Its proximity to the campus. First, the smell of smoking is widespread in all rooms. Second, the cleanliness of the bathrooms. Thirdly, there is no maintenance for bulbs. Electricity. There is no boiler. There is no telephone far from the dining areas.
A cute story of sorts of writing ...
Just two stars to know what relationships are in our homelands .. I was raised. Wait for the best, best and best.
I never liked it, no language, dialogue or arrangement. Base read, then closed it alone. She portrayed love and romance very violently
The receptionist has no way of talking to customers. I just liked the site. Old and uncomfortable beds and serviced at unexpected customer service
The worst thing I read for Mustafa Mahmoud
Messing with history
Frequent thoughts about traveling, maintaining Islam, and alienation
I was disappointed after two chapters of this boring and bad novel. A novel that makes you feel until the end of it that the writer has not yet entered the story, a miserable serial description of unnecessary things ... and completely ignored to describe very necessary things .. the novelist tried to create new events or ascend from the novel&#39;s form in a very artificial and artificial way .. again high ratings The critics&#39; praise of the novel is very disappointing, perhaps more than the bad level of the novel.
Too bad and I will not stay a second time in a pyramid hotel and stick with high sums. . I did not like the price increase and the lack of accuracy in adhering to the reserved from the net system. Unfortunately, there is no commitment in the internet to the high value of one breakfast, why would he eat his sacrifice?
Not as amazing as I imagined it
Reckless style. Quote from the Qur&#39;an in pornographic content. The amount of sex unrelated to the subject of the story The worst thing I&#39;ve ever read ...
Weak. Its location in the heart of Raqqa area and its proximity to services is no honor. Not overlooking Al-Raqqa Street, as it is written. The receptionist is bad in dealing and mortgages the passport, and this is illegal or takes money in exchange for taking the passport to ensure that visitors are not allowed to enter for those interested in the rooms.
A very unsuccessful food ...
Perhaps you were enthusiastic at the beginning of the general idea of the novel about a book seller who stumbles and loses a book and then follows it driven by a desire to know what is in it and flies between confusion and hesitation in wanting to know what is in it or asceticism, but with time this enthusiasm receded, especially as we move forward with the details of the novel and reveal papers in the Dassar And his thoughts
Staff at the wrong spot. car parking. Receiving the room is too late
I was disappointed in the book ... because I thought it would be stronger than that .... As a summary, it seems to me that it is merely an account of personal thoughts about the way the writer thinks but he does not rely on him to convince or persuade because he is not written in a scientific style and has some annoying fallacies .... But in fairness there are some beautiful and important ideas.
To produce a novel, with inspiration and a quote from historical events, an idea that I love ... and I often enjoy and like this type of narration. Because it urges research and knowledge, and more importantly, it puts us in the eye of the event and in the characters of the protagonists of the novel, capable of emotion and error, on the contrary when we read abstract historical events, then we apply judgments on this and that with simplicity and theoretical .... This depends on the writer&#39;s style and imagination ... The novelist, as well as a neutral and logical proposition ,,. In order for this kind of fictional narration of novels not to be taken with which we drive history as we comically desire ... and this is what happened here: I have not completed a novel because my version is incomplete, and I do not expect that I will be interested in research to complete it. Because he employed Jerji for important historical events such as this, in the fictional characters he added. He was very comical and superficial. Also hadiths: |
Very weak. nothing. Poor hygiene and poor quality services
If there was less than the star, I would use you for any amount of weakness and stupidity in this novel
Low level. The staff treated well. The furniture in the apartment is bad and the bathrooms are poor. The bathrooms are bad, the refrigerator does not cool, and there are no buffet services for tea and coffee. The reality is very different from the pictures. Also, towels and bed linen are not good.
To be honest, my experience for him is very unsuccessful, and Shane, and, God willing, I will enter it again, we went to him almost Thursday, the restaurant was empty. She just wanted to feel the spices and seasoning more chicken They have a decor The toilet and you with dignity, clean work, sweet and sweet smell, and there are no tissues on the ground, I felt the filling of automobiles, surrounded by cream and fragrance and towels, sweet movements, and the prices are very expensive to eat.
Very weak. . A very bad experience from the staff, nothing but excellent Egyptians, but the rest are all bad. I did not like the stay
I read it eagerly. Until I arrived. To his denunciation of the seventies generation. And who called them. Hippien Arab poetry. Maybe. The movement of modernity has begun. Revolution without aim. But she quickly set her goal. I couldn&#39;t complete the book. After this article ... I don&#39;t know if I will return to it or not
I don&#39;t like human development books. I do not trust a book said to change your life. I do not trust a book mentioned on its cover that its sales exceeded one million copies. Human development is the only field in Egypt where we have achieved self-sufficiency, and we can export, and training certificates in it have become more like instruments of forgiveness in the dark ages of Europe. I read it only because I want to relieve my conscience and do not repeat the experience again
I couldn&#39;t comment on the whole book just to name a few. What I liked about the book is its idea and it accepts the writer to search for the truth and research in other religions and not accepting the idea of this is what our father found ... some weaknesses. The first thing in the book started to liken some religions placed in the Islamic religion and the convergence of their ideas and likeness of the Greek gods to the angels, which makes Islam the object of doubt to those who ask him himself .. Another point is that the writer was blaming the atheists by attacking the religious and describing them as naive while the writer does not find any embarrassment by describing the atheists as arrogance and foolishness and foolishness and imitating them with animals That you don&#39;t agree with. The writer&#39;s view of scientific theories is not that of a researcher for four years. Rather, he was repeating what the common people repeat about the Big Bang and development. He finds that evolution is apes transformed into a human being. Many believers believe in the accuracy of these scientific theories because they basically do not contradict the existence of the Creator. They only explain how things happen without reference to the existence of a Creator or not .. At first, the writer rejects the theory of the Big Bang and then inferred from the Qur&#39;an on the validity of this theory? Have they not seen those who disbelieve that the heavens and the earth were slavery, and we have separated them? In a number of chapters, the author has interpreted the Qur’an according to the likes of most interpretations he wrote, for which no source has been written. I do not think that the Qur’an is a literary or scientific book in which you search for and interpret the facts according to what befits you or what you find appropriate for Islam to defend. Some verses, such as the creation of the fetus, have a scholarly dispute over it, and placing it as a miracle without clarifying the scholarly dispute that may offend religion more than it raises it. Another point concerning science and religion is that some scientific hypotheses invalidate over time. Science is in constant development and modernization. Does this make the Qur’an questionable? Or, it is insulting in religion when some people decide to link the Qur’an to the scientific miracles .. Even at the end of the book, the writer clarifies some verses and links them and their interpretation to the liking of the reader so that he did not agree with them that the Qur’an mentioned faith in the constellations. This is the conclusion of modifying texts for personal purposes. In another chapter, the author regrets the situation of women in Europe during the dark ages, and I would like to see him describe the condition of women in the current Islamic era. And put this point as if it defects Christianity. If his measure of religion is with the hardening that is taking place, then it is more important to consider that ISIS represents the true Islam. What you refuse to your religion do not blame the debt of others. Likewise, Christian militants treated women deservingly, and the extremists of Islam treated them similarly. The writer believes that underdevelopment in Europe at the time was due to religious beliefs and churches. Does he now likewise believe that the cause of underdevelopment in the Middle East is religious beliefs and mosques? The writer also mentioned that the woman’s physical desire outweighs the man and he did not mention any scientific source that proves it. If this information is correct, it will cancel one of the main reasons for legalizing marriage by four, which is to protect the man from engaging in forbidden relationships. As a matter of first, it is permissible to marry four women. In conclusion, the book was different from the best-selling books of these years. I think it deserves an opportunity to read it even if it is not accurate in its content or is broad in other sciences.
I bought the book and read it on the advice of a friend ... but it is very bad and childish to the last degree. His literary level is very low. I would have stopped reading it on its front pages, but I regretted the amount you paid for this book. Very boring and childish .. People fly by Mundhir al-Qabbani, and I have gone away from Bali that people are chaotic, they are the mob of society ...
I will not repeat this hotel. . Services are poor, unresponsive, cleaning bad, waiting for the taxi is taking too long
Weak. . Service style at reception
A book with a difficult philosophy..I did not like much like the book Al-Badaa &#39;and Al-Tarifa and a book of tears and a smile, perhaps because of the difficulty of the style..I need to read it again to understand it more..and to give it a better evaluation..Gibran&#39;s writings sometimes need a deep look at the vocabulary that cannot consist of the first reading. .
I will change my destination next time. Only the site is what we liked. The reception was not good, the trash bins were not changed for two days in the room
Each time read a set of pages from the novel. Go back to the cover of the novel and make sure that Ali Megri&#39;s name is on it. Hirk work and porn without a goal. A mixture of Communism, Salafism, and hard ideas with a lot of pornography, the woman wears her cloak as a permanent accuser of all corruption and evil on the ground ... a work that does not deserve to be written by the author of the current Jewish novel ... Ali al-Maqri was unsuccessful in his sanctuary ... He considered it his fall came Early ... despite my great enthusiasm and I read it because I know that whoever wrote it created a day in a work for him in the name of the current Jew, except for what he presented on his sanctuary is unfortunate and does not relate to the novel and its arts are related ..
It is the least of Ahmed Murad’s beautiful novels, as a dramatic plot when he is holding breath and I am not breathless to follow the events .. Rather I left her for a week or more until I managed from her after the beginning of a dull, slow, and not interesting ... The writer is in collecting historical information and keeping pace with the events of the novel ... The main problem for me is a novel that tends to history that is very much loved by myself. The characters of slight dimensions appear as ghosts or as quasi-likes ... I did not merge with them and did not feel them and did not mix with their details and in their dimensions completely like the rest of Murad&#39;s characters in his previous novels .... the cover is distinctive ... out of the totality of the two stars ... the main mix of the novel is a romantic policy Sex Action is a mixture of any novel that seeks to enter the path of satisfaction, often young readers. The controversy surrounding the novel in advance caused it to lose a lot of its splendor ... The defense of Murad&#39;s fans and their apparent bias towards the writer in a western group. The novel is as if it was a sacred book above criticism ... and any of them refused to see others in the level of words or disliked the novel. The revolution is on the way to collapse under the weight of the military, as almost happened to a revolution. The souls have not changed ... Saad Zaghloul ... someone needs a study to understand his experience more clearly. The novel is very expensive in its price ... The novel went out with intent from the world of interesting fairy tales to the world of fairy tales of a refined nature, as in our house, for example, a man .... waiting for another work to replace this novel, which I did not enjoy as I had enjoyed before Murad&#39;s previous accounts. ..
A very boring and superficial book, and the sale of words is a lot and unscientific. After the talk of evolutionary psychology on these issues and the choice of men and women, this is mostly fax
Anwar Al Diyafah Hotel is a wrong choice. There is no. The entire hotel is sey
Weak. Room arrangement and quiet. Cleanliness, service and staff
A romantic story for teenagers written in poor language, but the story is special.
Very sadly when he read about the problems of religious minorities because they are not limited to one place, like Iraq in Muslim countries, on the contrary, they remained everywhere, sadly about extremism that distorted the Islamic religion, allowing the religion of peace that provides any religion of safety even in the case of a call to Islam, it is well known, Sadly, our elders have gone away from educating young generations about the essence and tolerance of Islam, and sadly, working to combat extremism in a superficial manner is limited to the series of series and announcements of any positive results, . I had little difficulty in understanding many meanings of the Iraqi colloquially because the Iraqi artworks here are in Egypt, not well-known as the Kuwaiti, Saudi or Syrian, but I liked the way of the narration by way of pictures hanging on the walls
Weak. . Treatment of the reception position
Weak. Awesome place so very I wish I could live in this place. There is little
Turki Al-Dakhil should write a new book. How agile will come again
Not comfortable. The luxury of the place. Starting from the reservation, as I booked through the bookings, but when I arrived, I did not find my request from some reception staff, but the problem was solved by the Relationship Manager because my request was a room overlooking Tahlia Street and the upper floors and not to disturb and rooms for non-smokers but unfortunately my request did not provide but we were promoted By the Relationship Manager and to apologize for some of the reception staff. Secondly, we asked for dinner from the hotel’s restaurant, an Indian chicken meal with rice and grilled fish with rice. When they brought dinner, the fish was fried and not grilled according to my request. With this, we had dinner and slept in the middle of the night. Obviously he got poisoned from dinner but had flesh God came right because the dinner did not like us and we didn’t eat more. Thirdly, the length of the stay and there was a defect in the room’s electricity, as the lighting in the room turns off and ignites on its own, and also if we want to open the curtains, the toilet lights are turned off, and if we want to light the room, the curtains are closed, and we are informed The administration and the employees with this thing, but the problem was not solved until the last day the batterer in the room was beaten and completely covered, after that the maintenance department came to try to solve the problem again, but I refused to enter them again to the room and we preferred to remain without lighting, the situation was escalated to the hotel owner and we were compensated the last night Free and to go out at any time Also, I am not obligated to watch by the occasion of a flowering letter to the family, and the hospitality of a coffee and a solution thanks to it. Fourthly, the lobby is crowded with women and children at the popular corner, and I sat for days that did not add, nor did it reach the coffee from this corner, although I remove my right to benefit from all hotel facilities, but the large number of visitors from outside the residents The hotel felt like a builder in a mall and not in a hotel.
Bad . Very normal I did not like something. Many inconveniences in what privacy between the rooms next to you hear all their words
Never deserve. The room is generally garbage, and one who does not deserve to enter it with his man, and they say: Who is righteous, does God?
Who loves the smell of eating, as if the kitchen is renting. The site for my business. The smell of the place is very bad even in the corridors. I changed my room because of the smell of everyone, which is of course because of the very bad Indian restaurant and cafe. . Inconvenience at night from the café, discotheque, and sound everywhere. There are no insulators, even the voices of the rooms above, as if you have had to buy fresheners for the air and the bedspreads.
Mercury. I found it an opportunity to read a work competing for Booker this year, but I gave up trying quickly, part of the secret of every novel is its ability to persuade the reader, making him accept the story and characters to continue reading, yes exciting the idea of the future novel, the occurrence of Egypt under occupation, and the division of Cairo into two parts, A section under occupation and a section under the control of the resistance, but what comes next is not convincing.
Visitor. Nothing, I would not recommend staying in it except for the Tunisian employee who is cooperative and lovely. Air conditioning is hot and noisy, rooms have nothing to do with cleanliness, no view at all, breakfast is poor and poor
I don’t repeat housing here. The location is good. Everything is bad from reception to checkout
Small. No details. And no events. Report on a rare mental illness. I don’t feel that it is a time bomb, as the writer mentioned in the introduction. Maybe it&#39;s rare. I feel that the whole story is written in order to get to know the necrophilia that we don’t know. A novel is not a novel is closer to the short story. The best thing about it is the names of the expressive characters Oooi. But I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know how to do it more than a star
She was not impressed with the first costume, but her style is world as usual .. Unfortunately, many details are not surprising and necessary.
May someone go to his dust. For things I liked. Staff C is very special, the Indian at the reception canceled the reservation and linked the rooms, so no one would give advice
The service is very bad, the room is not clean, the room is not clean, there is no bed sheet, no cover and a lack of pillows, the hotel does not eat, the service is bad and the smell of pesticides, there are cockroaches, and it was a bad experience, and the phone, if any, does not work, and when you go to bed, they change the beds of the bed when the biju cleans it
Weak, boring, and incomprehensible due to excessive abbreviation
very bad. I do not believe that it is in the literature of the baccalaureate school literature. Vacca Via lack of Moroccan novels
Miserable experience. . There is no parking, and it is a bad place, and most of its residents have campaigns, inconveniences, smells, non-privacy, and the restaurant is bad
Repeated topic ... non constructive and non-philosophical criticism ... his ironic style is weak
Very bad . price. Cleanliness, location, services and delivery to the campus and the Internet
It is just joyful thoughts or flashes, and makes you smile and smile
The beautiful language of the author could not heal the strangeness that surrounds the style on all sides .. The book is a set of letters from a girl to a friend, but the writing style makes you return to making sure that the writer is young and I mistook it as a girl at the beginning .. There are very beautiful similes, but I I felt a bit of a monotony and repetition after the first five texts.
uncomfortable . . The crew is not friendly and there was maintenance and noise during the night
I like her work on the text and I detest the lengthy: /
Over. . Bad with services, workers, or cleanliness
Is bad. . The treatment of the reception staff for the evening period was asphalt
And did the constitution, like the chest, if it was separated by the tailor. The line up blows and separates with his consent the Governing Council of officers. Amjad Al-Qahwaji. Oboco
The novel is entertaining and exciting. I gave her two stars for several reasons: How to comment the reader at a climax and quickly move to another character for several pages, frankly, the way I like to think of Arabic series is incomplete, it places ads in the text ... suspicious interest in details of porn in his field. Using the symbol and projecting the conditions of the country in a very superficial way that does not call for any thinking, as there was no deficiency, except that it degrades the explanation at the bottom of the page. Nevertheless, I was very tired of her villages, and I wanted to save her.
Receptionist is very very bad. Breakfast needs more types. The employee at the reception is very very bad. He calls the hour at dawn. He wants to pay the bill for the bar. He sent someone to the room at the same time. He was very, very, very annoying. I could not sleep until the morning. We were exhausted into the morning and could not go to work, who is responsible for the loss of a working day
I liked the cover frankly, but the novel is an Arabic film and a lot of it is all narrated
Everything is beautiful, but I did not entrust Windham to other countries, such as Windham, Dubai. I expected Dubai to be the best. Positions. Noise in the place, difficulty in reaching the GBR, delay in dropping the bags, and receiving the car until they were asked to tell you and told me that the employee authorized him to bring another person and he apologized for disturbing them
Do not book in it if you have children because there are no chairs for children, but an announcement to attract people. Positions. I was given a different room from the one I booked, and I tried with the administration to find solutions but unfortunately an administrative performance that does not rise to the hotel site.
A play that fell short of me. Tawfiq Al-Hakim is a well-known play, and there is no dust, and I loved his other works, but this play did not move about anything. The writer used smooth and fluent language, but the story was between push and pull, until the play ended in poor meaning. A cliched ending that makes each one of us the same.
Residence of the jinn. nothing. It is a residence for other creatures before it is for humans
Very weak . Only value. Everything is disturbing by the discos in the hotel and the disco
Dr. Youssef has a number of personal convictions that can accommodate a series of articles, but he crammed four scenes of a wonderful novel to be a prelude to these articles, and therefore we are not in front of a novel at all.
I am still asking myself to the extent that I read it, why? . You may attract me in the first when I knew that the heroine of the story is dumb and that he loves her and wants to marry her. It can be imagined at the time that he would stand his mother’s economy and convince her of his love for his dumb cousin. And convince her that the fact that she is dumb, he will not be hindered by anything that she is a wife and a mother. However, the exact opposite happened, and Hattan surrendered from his first tour with his mother. Also, I do not know, or are I unable to imagine how Muslim people would analyze themselves forbidden? Do these things have nothing to do with Islam? It is possible that I liked only the novel Haneen, despite her handicap, not that she was strong and did not sit with her hand on her cheek, waiting for the return of Hattan to her. But with the first opportunity for her to marry, she got married and left him as he left her. In short, the novel spoke more about the love of the body than the love of the soul and has a disgusting need. Very good:
