Positive,Positive,"we purchased this game about a year ago and all the kids here enjoy playing it ... ages 3 through 10.  it's challenging enough for the older kids to catch the falling butterflies and easy enough for the little ones to gather them up off the floor.  we've had great times with this game and it's quick enough that those with short attention spans can finish the game without upsetting the rest who still want to play.  i've found that the batteries even last quite a while in this one, which is unusual for games of this nature.  the only trouble that i've found with this game is; sometimes the butterflies come out in larger groups rather than a couple at a time.",game year ago enjoy enough older catch falling easy enough little gather floor weve great game quick enough short attention finish game without rest still play last unusual games nature trouble game larger couple time,,,,

Positive,Positive,this game is so much fun!  my twin 4yr. old boys just received it for their birthday and it has brought hours of fun to our home.  it promotes great hand-eye coordination and gets them to play together and share!  lots of team work going on here -- they work to pick up all the butterflies after the game is over and put the elephant trunk back in place!  there's so much competition to see who can catch the most butterflies but there's no fighting or arguing!  what a pleasure.the game does go by quick but i think that's great especially when you factor in the attention span of two 4 year olds.  they really need for things to keep moving.  there's no sitting idle with this game.  you've got to be quick on your feet to play!the durability isn't bad but not great either.  you've got to be careful with the nets as to not be too rough and break them.  the elephants trunk needs to be treated with care so that it doesn't get kinked or torn -- i think it could be a bit shorter as well. i do wish that there were more butterflies because it seems as though they'd have even more fun if it didn't go by so quickly.  it really doesn't take long for all the butterflies to come up through the trunk and then it's over.  back to the beginning!i do give this game a 4 star rating just because it is so much fun to watch them play together and get so excited to count how many butterflies each of them have caught at the end of the game!!!,game much fun twin old boys received birthday hours fun home great coordination play together share team work going work pick game put elephant trunk back place much competition see catch arguing game go quick think great attention span two year really need keep moving idle game quick durability bad great careful rough break trunk treated get torn think bit shorter well wish fun go quickly really long trunk back give game star rating much fun watch play together get excited count many game,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my three year old son saw this advertised and asked for it as a present - the only time he has ever done this for any game or toy.the game comes with:* large blue elephant fan base and translucent plastic trunk* thirty rip-stop nylon butterflies* several butterfly markers for keeping score* four mesh nets for catching butterfliesthe unit requires 4 ""c"" batteries (not included.)when powered on, a quiet fan in the elephant base pushes air up the elephant's trunk forcing the butterflies out. players try to catch the butterflies in their nets. our family has played this game and enjoyed it. catching the randomly fluttering butterflies is an excellent eye-hand coordination activity. and even though the game is geared for younger kids, there is enough of a challenge that all ages can play and enjoy it. (one of the nicest things about the game is that it really does not matter who wins, the game play is fun enough in itself. we don't even keep score and no one minds.)elefun is not without its issues, though:1. plays quickly, but then it takes considerably more time to get it ready for the next round of play than it takes to actually play.2. the trunk has to be extended manually even with the fan on at the beginning of play. once fully extended, it will stay up.3. eats batteries like mad. the fan works best with fresh batteries and the quality of play goes down quickly (not all the butterflies will come out) if the batteries are not 100%. a dc adapter option would have been nice.4. while the entire set is durable, the trunk is a bit suspect. made out of a plastic a bit thicker than a plastic garbage bag, it is subject to holes as it gets repeatedly crinkled during normal play. our son inexplicably took a scissors to it, but fortunately it was repairable (though we lost a bit of length.)all things considered, the game is fun and a good activity for young children. what kind of value it is for the money is debatable - a friend gave us this game, so it's a win-win for us. batteries are an issue, however, and i would seriously recommend purchasing a big set of rechargeables anyway for any parent who buys battery-reliant toys. considering how fast you'll use up batteries with elefun, you'll save money in the long run if you do so.",three year old saw present time game game large blue elephant fan base translucent plastic trunk thirty nylon several butterfly keeping score mesh catching unit quiet fan elephant base air trunk try catch family game catching excellent coordination activity game younger enough challenge play enjoy game really matter game play fun enough keep score without quickly considerably time get ready next round play actually trunk manually fan beginning play fully stay mad fan best fresh quality play quickly adapter option entire set durable trunk bit suspect plastic bit thicker plastic garbage bag subject normal play repairable lost bit game fun good activity young children kind value money debatable friend game seriously recommend purchasing big set anyway parent fast use save money long run,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i will start off by saying that i really don't agree much with the other reviewers.  as a parent, you have to have a little sense in how to operate some of these toddler toys.  they're not made of steel nor are they completely idiot-proof. yes, the trunk does not go up immediately when you turn it on, that's why you're supposed to pull it up yourself, according to the directions.  also, the butterflies have no problem coming out of ours - you can see them when they're about to come out and if they get stuck, just tap on the trunk and out they come.this is such a fun toy for a three-year-old and is marvelous in developing hand and eye coordination.  plus, all the giggles that it creates is just amazing and fun.  i had a bunch of fun playing as did my husband too.  it would be nice if there were a few more butterflies but all-in-all, i'd buy this for everyone i knew.  it's just a great way to entertain children and teach them at the same time.  it is very durable, even the nets but you have to teach the children not to treat them like they're made of flint.  this toy is made to be realistic in the netting so it also is teaching children how to better care for their things.  buy this game, you certainly won't be disappointed.",start really agree much parent little sense operate toddler steel completely yes trunk go immediately turn pull according directions problem coming see get stuck tap trunk fun toy marvelous developing hand eye coordination plus amazing fun bunch fun husband nice buy everyone great way entertain children teach time durable teach children treat flint toy realistic children better buy game certainly disappointed,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i look for toys that are fun and easy to play with. i also look for toys that are educational or inspire exploration of the world around them. i want toys that are not really loud as well.this toy fits many of these requirements.my four year old son got this for his birthday and has loved it ever since.like the other reviewers, the trunk does not go all the way up when you first turn the fan on. however, that doesn't take away from the fun of the game. in fact, we just cut the top few inches off of the trunk and that seems to have made the difference.catching butterflies is harder than it looks. that is part of what adds to the fun. they also come out in spurts. you might get four butterflies and then one and then ten. all of this just adds to the fun. catching the butterflies encourages eye and hand coordination and quick thinking.my only complaint is that more butterflies would be fun. there are plenty of butterflies but it doesn't take too long to play because they come out fairly quickly.however, this is great for young children who have a short attention span. you can finish one or two games and call it quits before they get bored.we haven't found this to be a battery eater.in general this is just a fun game with one or two small flaws that are easily overlooked when playing a game with your kids.enjoy.",look fun easy play look educational inspire exploration world around really loud toy many year old birthday loved trunk go way first turn fan away fun game fact cut top trunk harder part fun get ten fun catching eye hand coordination quick complaint fun plenty long play fairly great young children short attention span finish two games call get battery general fun game two small easily game,,,,

Positive,Positive,"could have been much better made.  my complaints are the same as some of the other reviewers.  the trunk has to be extended manually at the beginning of each game (maybe more flexible material would have helped).  there need to be way more butterflies, especially since they don't come out right.  at the end of each game there are still a few, if not many, butterflies left inside the bottom.  it also goes through batteries pretty quickly.two year old loves this game so it is worth the bit of hassle for his enjoyment.  i also think this is an excellent way to improve hand-eye coordination and reflexes.  definitely room for improvement but still a decent buy for the price.",much better trunk manually beginning game maybe flexible material need way right game still many left inside bottom pretty year old game worth bit hassle enjoyment think excellent way improve coordination definitely room improvement still decent buy price,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i bought this toy for my son's second birthday.  he absolutely loved it but was soon using the net as a swing (he sat on it).  consequently, the toy fell apart and continues to fall apart very easily.  granted, my son shouldn't of sat on it but my two year old wanted to play with it that way. what can you do huh? anyway, even though it falls apart, he likes to turn it on and watch it shake and talk while he kicks the ball into it. when it does fall apart, he can put it back together himself.  this toy would have gotten a better review if it had been made sturdier but that is my only complaint.",toy second birthday absolutely loved soon using net swing toy apart continues fall apart easily two year old wanted play way huh anyway apart turn watch shake talk ball fall apart put back together toy better review sturdier complaint,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my son received this a few months ago as a gift for his first birthday.  the one we have is different colors than the one shown, but from the moment this was removed from its box, it has been a favorite for him.  he quickly learned how to push the button to turn it on and enjoys chasing the balls all around his playroom.  he also enjoys just putting his face over the top to feel the air come out.  :)  my only complaint is that when he puts something in the ball shoot that is not supposed to go in there, it is a little difficult to pull it apart for when i have to dig it out.  i suppose it makes it good that they can't easily rip it apart, but makes it difficult for mom when you're trying to fix it and you have an angry 16-month old that just wants to play with it...  overall, i would highly recommend this toy!",received ago gift first birthday different moment removed box favorite quickly learned push button turn around playroom top feel air complaint ball shoot go little difficult pull apart suppose good easily rip apart difficult mom trying fix angry old play overall highly recommend toy,,,,

Positive,Positive,"hard to know how to review this, but needed to say something...this is my son's favorite toy. in fact, he will play with very little else. he turns this on every morning by 6 am. he will make his way through a completely dark house to the front room to find this. the music is way too loud and it's insane. and i have to listen to it all day long. if he's awake, this thing is on. yes, the balls shoot all over. yes, this would be the toy the devil would make if he could make toys. but my son loves it. plus, he has learned how to fix it on his own when the balls get stuck in the tube, and it taught him how to put balls in a small hole, and he'll hunt all over the house for the ""right"" balls to fit in this, as he has learned that using the ""wrong"" balls messes it up. so it has taught him a bunch. but i still hate it. we buy him other ball-type toys in hopes that he will forget this, but he ignores them all. we once switched it off and told him it was broken or dead or something, but he pounded on it and screamed to the point where we worried he would hurt himself, so we swtiched it back on. if we put it away he hunts for it non-stop. fyi, my son is 13 months and has had this since he was about 7 months, and his fixation on it only gets stronger. he sort of likes the dino ball drop, but it's no ball popper.",hard know review say favorite toy fact play little else every morning make way completely dark house front room find music way loud insane listen day long awake yes shoot yes toy devil make make plus learned fix get stuck tube put small hole hell hunt house right fit learned using wrong bunch still hate buy forget broken dead point worried hurt back put away fixation stronger ball drop ball,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my son loves this toy and so do we.  he is 9 months and has had it since he was 6 months.  he doesn't necessarily use it the way it's intended, but he loves to turn it on and pull it towards him so the balls go flying out and the air blows in his face.one trick we learned is to wear the batteries down a bit; the balls don't fly out as fast/crazy when the air flow is weaker.  (note: if it gets too weak, you may have to block the airlow to build up pressure to get the balls started)  also, if the sound is really bothersome (doesn't bother us, but read reviews where it bothers others) you can remove the battery that does the sound.  can't remember which one it is, but you can find it by removing one at a time and pressing the plunger until the air works but it's silent.only downside to this is that our ball ramp doesn't lock into the bottom part securely, so we have to press it in pretty frequently.",toy necessarily use way intended turn pull go air trick learned wear bit fly air flow weaker note weak block build pressure get sound really bothersome bother read others remove battery sound remember find time plunger air downside ball ramp lock bottom part securely press pretty frequently,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i bought this for my son when he was 4 months old at walmart for $9.99 and it came with another toy too.  he loved watching the balls go round and round and over the next few months, he learned to use it to pull himself up with (he has awesome balance, i wouldn't recommend that).  he also liked to take it apart and just feel the air blow on his face.  i'm sure this is a one time thing, but at about 7 months, he spit up down into the tube while he was playing with it ( he had bad reflux)  and i was able to clean it out easily with a damp rag threaded through the tube.  now, that's a durable toy!  over the months, the way he played with the ball popper changed.  he started predicting that a ball would pop out, so he put his hand over the hole and stopped it.  he would remove the balls quickly as they came down the chute.  at 19 months, he still enjoys playing with it, watching it, dragging it around, and interrupting the flow of the balls and replacing them.  this toy is a great buy and will last a very long time.update 2014: my second son played with it a lot as well.  it worked just as well and was just as engaging for him as for my first.  i took out the batteries and put it in the attic in a box of ""save for grandkids"" toys that are things i just can't part with.  maybe it won't work in 20-25 years, but i hope it does.  just like i wish my parents had kept that clown hat sprinkler that now sells for hundreds on ebay because it's so ""dangerous"" (we had a lot of fun!)",old walmart toy loved go round round next learned use pull awesome balance recommend liked apart feel air blow sure time spit tube bad able clean easily damp rag tube durable toy way ball changed ball pop put hand hole remove quickly chute still around flow toy great buy last long second lot well well first put attic box save part maybe work hope wish clown dangerous lot fun,,,,

Positive,Positive,"our 20 month old played with this at a friend's house and didn't want to put it away, which is not like her since she bores easily with most toys.  we purchased one for her and the moment she sets it down to play, her face lights up, she squeals with delight when she presses the big red ball to start the action, and then once the balls start popping in the air, she is overjoyed.the colorful balls are placed in the chute on top of the unit, then as they slide down the ramp, the air popper forces them up through the top hole and they pop around like popcorn!  we watch our daughter laugh and have a blast with this toy all the time, but she is learning so much from it as well.  first she learned cause and effect when pushing the red lever to start the machine.  she learned that the music will not start until the balls begin moving.  next she learned where to place the balls, and how to catch them if they scooted away, and finally she learned words like ball, stop, out, play, dance just from the repetition of the activities.  the fun music reminds me of a circus parade and several songs randomly play while the popper is activated.storage is a snap since it's heavy enough to stay upright while playing, and light enough to grab and go when it's time to clean up.  there are three main pieces that an adult has to screw together, and though a child might be able to pry off the top piece, it easily snaps back into place.  just don't lift it from the top piece and you shouldn't have a problem.i recommend this toy for babies who are able to sit up unassisted so that an adult can help them play with the balls, but highly recommend it for walking toddlers since they will love chasing after the balls.a+ from this parent on this one!",month old house put away easily moment play delight big red ball start action start air colorful chute top unit slide ramp air top hole pop around popcorn watch daughter laugh blast toy time learning much well first learned cause effect pushing red lever start machine learned music start begin moving next learned place catch away learned ball stop play dance repetition fun music circus parade several play snap heavy enough stay upright light enough grab go time clean three main adult screw together child able pry top piece easily back place lift top piece recommend toy able adult help play highly recommend love parent,,,,

Positive,Positive,"the busy ball popper is something of a rarity in today's toy market - it's unapologetic fun that makes very little attempt to teach anything at all.  as long as you understand what you're getting, then it's great.our son gets a kick out of watching the balls loop through the machine and into the air;  he gets an even bigger kick when the balls bounce wrong and rebound throughout the room.  it's a mini-workout chasing after them, but it's worth it to see him enjoy it so.i agree with other reviews that the unit could be easily tipped over, but the last time i checked, the easy solution to this problem is to supervise your child.  trust me - you'll have as much fun as he/she does watching the ball popper at work.  but again, this isn't suitable for any pull-up or lean-on activity.the fan motor that propels the balls is about as loud as a hair dryer on a low setting.  however, the music snippets make up for the white noise as they're better than most toys.  the balls themselves are very lightweight in order to allow them to travel;  as a result, they are likely too fragile for play beyond the ball popper.again, the busy ball popper is a lot of fun and does what it's intended to do very well.  it's not educational (get something leapfrog) and it's not a pull-up toy and it's not trying to be either.  if you go in understanding what you're getting, you won't be disappointed.",busy ball toy market unapologetic fun little attempt teach long understand kick loop machine air bigger kick bounce wrong rebound throughout room worth see enjoy agree unit easily last time easy solution problem supervise child trust much fun ball work suitable fan motor loud hair dryer low setting music make white noise better lightweight order allow travel result likely fragile play beyond ball busy ball lot fun intended well educational get toy trying go understanding disappointed,,,,

Positive,Positive,this toy is great for my 13 month old!  my son loves to try to catch the balls as the pop out of the top.  he also tries to push the balls down while the others are trying to pop out.  one downside to this toy is that the balls will pop out of the tube and bounce out of the top and onto the floor.  if my son already is holding a ball in each hand he wont go after the others on the floor so eventually there is no balls in the toy and i have to put them back in it.  but really this is a good toy to play alongside with your child.  it is fun to watch him frantically try to stop the balls from going back down the slide and into the tunnel.  a hint if you do buy it and the balls pop out all over the place: us batteries that are halfway dead!  the first batteries i put in this toy were dying and i did not have a problem with the balls going onto the floor because the air was not so forceful.  we have put this toy in a corner so usually the balls bounce on the wall and back onto the top of the toy.,toy great month old try catch pop top push others trying pop downside toy pop tube bounce top onto floor already holding ball hand go others floor toy put back really good toy play alongside child fun watch frantically try stop going back slide tunnel hint buy pop place halfway dead first put toy dying problem going onto floor air forceful put toy corner bounce wall back onto top toy,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this turtle is awesome.  it was a hit with the kids for the month of july then, toward the end of the month, i noticed it was looking a little deflated.  i will be honest and say that the kids (3 of them) were kind of hard on this poor little turtle including jumping on him at long distances from the side of the pool, trying to all pile on at the same time, and jerking it away from one another when trying to take possession.  so...sadly...mr. turtle is going into the recycle bin since it's clear he has a hole somewhere and i'm not spending hours and hours looking for it just to patch it up.however, next summer, i'll be buying another one.  (i didn't get mine on amazon.  i bought it at a local walmart and actually paid more than what it's listed on amazon for.)  this turtle is really large, very stable for the kids which is important when they're on its back, and they go crazy over this thing because it's like a floating island yet so irresistible because it's a turtle!",turtle awesome hit month toward month looking little honest say kind hard poor little turtle including long side pool trying pile time away trying possession turtle going recycle clear hole spending hours hours looking patch next summer buying get amazon local walmart actually paid amazon turtle really large stable important back go crazy floating island irresistible turtle,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i have to admit i thought they could have made more of an effort to have the ropes equal before shipping. when i got my swing, one side was about 2 feet and the other about 5 feet. i spent an hour trying to equal the ropes on both sides and finally gave up and put the swing back in the box. the next day i put both feet on the swing and pulled the short end of the rope with both hands and finally got the two back ends equal. once i did that, the swing hands beautifully. i don't think it can fall over backward, as i've read here, not if it's hanging properly. i also found the try very easy to release, just reach under the try on both sides and pull the plastic locking pieces so that they unlock and the try pops up so you can pull it up the rope and swing it away.. the swing itself is very sturdy, had a lot of room for baby or toddler and the harness is easy to snap together.. i hung the two attached hooks to an old chain i had already attached to a tree. i'm more worried about the old chain than i am about this swing. i can't believe the others are selling for so much money. this is sure as good as any i've seen and a lot less expensive. if it had come with the ropes a little more equal on both sides, i'd have given it five stars. personally, i don't get the negative comments, especially the security issues. unless there is something wrong with the swing and/or the ropes, i just don't see how it could tip over. i tried to see if i could get it to tip or twist (before putting baby in it) and i couldn't. the ropes in the back are shorter than the ropes in the front and the back of the chair is higher than the front, i just don't see how it could tip if it's locked into place in the back like it's suppose to be and the ropes are as shown. i'd recommend it, and i'm using it for my grandson.",admit thought effort equal shipping swing side hour trying equal put swing back box next day put swing short rope two back equal swing beautifully think fall backward read properly try easy release reach try pull plastic unlock try pull rope swing away swing sturdy lot room baby toddler harness easy snap together two old chain already tree worried old chain swing believe others much money sure good lot less expensive little equal five personally get negative security wrong swing see tip tried see get tip twist baby back shorter front back chair higher front see tip place back suppose recommend using grandson,,,,

Positive,Positive,this has become one of my favorite toys. my daughter just turned 1 and she adores it. it comes with the mother and a baby in a car seat as well as her stroller. the van has eyes which move when the wheels spin and you can honk the horn. it also palys the music to if you're happy and you know it.... when the horn is honked again. it does seem a bit loud but it plays for only a short time when pressed. my daughter can't fit them in properly yet but she gets them in the car and pushes it around anyway. i love this toy because it is one of the few for children her age that lets her use her imagination. i will be picking up the little people zoo or barn next since my daughter loves animals. this toy is durable and easy to clean. it can also be taken everywhere since it is a good size to carry along. the only thing that bothers me is that my daughter always throws the mom on the floor and plays with the baby. is she trying to tell me something ;-))??,become favorite daughter mother baby car seat well stroller move spin honk horn music happy know horn bit loud short time daughter fit properly car around anyway love toy children age use imagination little people zoo barn next daughter animals toy durable easy clean everywhere good size carry daughter mom floor baby trying tell,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we purchased for dd when approx 1 yr of age.  at first she was only slightly interested in the car part and even less interested in the fact that it played music and that she could place people in the car. however in about a month, it became a favorite of her's.  we always bring along on trips to grandma & grandpa's as we know it's sure to occupy time and spur creativity.pros:- small enough & light enough for little ones to push around easily- play several catchy tunes such as london bridges and if you're happy and you know it, in addition to a few sounds (ie car noises, a horn honking)- hatch that opens in the back to place buggy (or wheel chair from the little people bus set) or to place/ remove people from car- large window and roof openings to place/ remove people from car- comes with a few ""people"" and can be used inter-changable with other little people sets- ""megablocks"" disney block buddies fit in the car seats also (we happen to have the piglet, pooh and tigger set)cons:- pink in color !  not very gender nuetral.- sometimes it's hard to place/ remove people from the car, as their arms get stuck in the window and roof openings.- depending on which people you try to place in the car, 2 people that have arms extended on each side of their bodies do not fit next to each other in the front seat, which frustrates dd.- music is slightly loud, however not to the point that i'm putting cotton in my ears :)overall this toy has gotten a lot of use in our family and i would definitely recommend it.",age first slightly interested car part less interested fact music place people car month favorite bring grandma know sure occupy time spur small enough light enough little push around easily play several catchy london happy know addition car horn hatch back place buggy wheel chair little people bus set place remove people car large window roof place remove people car people little people disney block fit car happen piglet pink color gender hard place remove people car get stuck window roof people try place car people side fit next front seat music slightly loud point cotton overall toy lot use family definitely recommend,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we bought this swing to put on our swing set for our 10 month old.  he fits in it perfectly (he weighs about 25 lbs) and his 3 year old brother fits in it as well (but he is big enough for the regular swings).  the swing is the perfect height for a premade swing set.  at first i thought it was a little high, but then i figured out that it's high so that parents don't have to lean down to push.  i'm 5' 7"" and it's a great height for me.  but if you are trying to hang it from a tree, you will probably need extra rope.it swings level on the swingset.  the only thing i have noticed is the slouching problem, but it's not that bad with our son, just a little slouching.  he doesn't find it uncomfortable (in fact he has fallen asleep in it 2 times in 3 days).a great feature of this one is that the front plate swings underneath and snaps there for when you don't want to use it anymore!  i have so many things that i have to search for pieces for when i need it for another child...i just love self contained baby items!there are no problems getting him in and out of this one when he is awake or sleeping as the front plate swings out of the way.",swing put swing set month old perfectly year old brother well big enough regular swing perfect height swing set first thought little high high lean push great height trying hang tree probably need extra level problem bad little find uncomfortable fact asleep great feature front plate underneath use anymore many search need love self baby awake sleeping front plate way,,,,

(can see pic in customer picture area)  i bought some of the porch swing attachments and the swing rides very smooth!many people complained about the swing causing a slouch.  to me, this is the next step up from his infant swing which he's been used to reclining in.  he's very laid back and relaxed in this swing and really enjoys it.  he's just now one year old, so it's my belief that when he's older (2-3??) and wants to sit up more while swinging, we may have to get another type of swing because of the design on this one, but for now he loves it and seems very comfortable in it, so i can't complain.",granny christmas swing well rope strong frame two ground top see customer picture porch swing swing people swing causing slouch next step infant swing back swing really year old belief older get type swing design comfortable complain,,,,

Positive,Positive,we bought this climber for our 20-month old son and he absolutely loves it!  we had it put together in 15 minutes and he was off playing on it immediately.  we were not ready for a big swingset/climber yet and this works great.  when he's on the platform he has 4 walls around him to keep him from falling off.  the colors are great because it doesn't look like a bright big toy in the backyard.  we put it off to the side and it doesn't even catch your eye when you look out the window. definitely money well spent.,climber old absolutely put together immediately ready big great platform around keep falling great look bright big toy backyard put side catch eye look window definitely money well,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we received this as a birth gift for our son, who is now one year old. it was wonderful watching him grow with this chair. at first, it was a snuggly hammock where he spent some of his more restless naps and nights. the vibrating feature was great for calming him, and we could rock the chair to help him get to sleep, then leave him safely buckled in.what was superior about this chair, as compared with the typical bouncy seat, is that when the kickstand is up, it is not on as steep an incline. this means it can be used by younger infants, even when they aren't great at holding their heads up. with bouncy seats, their heads tend to flop over.eventually he began batting at and grabbing the toys on the toy bar, which helped keep the chair interesting enough that he'd remain calm while i took a shower, checked e-mail, etc. this chair was one of those priceless items we would pack up and take with us when we travelled so he'd have a familiar place to hang out, wherever we were.so for those first 6 months, this chair was definitely a winner. but since he's gotten more active, he is not content to sit there for long at all, and when he tries to sit forward, it does appear that the chair might tip over (though it never has). the one remaining thing i find useful about it is that it's a good place to buckle him in when i need to trim his fingernails. it keeps him still if i put the kickstand up.i'm not getting rid of it yet. i am hoping that when he reaches an age that he's willing to sit still at all, this chair will be a place he enjoys.

Positive,Positive,"as another reviewer said, this item was useful from day 1 at home.  as a newborn, our son would take long naps in the cradle position.  in a few weeks, he began to enjoy the rocker position and began to rock himself when on a hard floor.  (this was especially helpful when fixing bottles, etc.) then he began to kick the ball.  his interest only declined when he could sit up on his own, but now that he's had months of practice sitting up, he's starting to show interest in the rocker again.  (in the meantime it was part of the bedtime routine as we placed a favorite stuffed animal in it to go to sleep each night.)one warning (especially for first time parents):  like other sleeping situations, make sure that your newborn's head doesn't lean to the same side every times he naps. his head shape can be affected.",reviewer useful day home newborn long cradle position enjoy rocker position rock hard floor helpful kick ball interest practice show interest rocker meantime part bedtime routine favorite stuffed animal go sleep warning first time sleeping make sure head lean side every head shape,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we bought this rocker/vibrating chair for our 3 mo old son after pondering over which bouncer to buy for him. most of the bouncers are hardly as versatile compared to this product. the mutliple recline positions are helpful for when our son wants to either sleep or sit and &quot;vibrate&quot; and rock and watch everything happening around him, including the tv. the only problems are; 1. the seat could have been more padded rather than a cloth covered board on his bottom. 2. the on/off switch for the vibrating mode can be easily turned &quot;on&quot; by accident and uses up the battery power without your knowledge. 3. after some time when using the vibrating mode, it makes the screws (holding the chair together) loose and makes a loud, annoying &quot;buzzing&quot; sound and then the structure of the entire chair can feel a little loose. 4. the velcro straps holding the toys on the toybar are too small and the toys tend to fall off on their own. otherwise, since these complaints are minor, the chair does a much better job than a standard bouncer. i even considered the new baby papasan chair, but it did not nearly have as many options and was not as versatile as this chair, plus this product was almost half the price of the papasan chair. we are happy with this choice.",chair mo old pondering bouncer buy hardly versatile product recline helpful sleep rock watch everything happening around including seat cloth board bottom switch mode easily accident battery power without knowledge time using mode holding chair together loose loud annoying sound structure entire chair feel little loose velcro holding small tend fall minor chair much better job standard bouncer new baby chair many versatile chair plus product half price chair happy choice,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i bought this for my 2.5 year old and he loves playing with it.  the velcro helps keep his creations together, which is needed because most of the ingredients are very thick and a simple sandwich quickly becomes too big for his little hands.besides the slices being so thick, which i guess is needed to keep them from breaking easily, i wish there were compartments in the wooden box to help keep it looking neater.  it always looks like just a bunch of stuff thrown in a box and that does bother me.  we have other wooden sets from melissa and doug and they do have compartments so i don't understand why this one does not.",year old velcro keep together thick simple sandwich quickly big little thick guess keep easily wish wooden box help keep looking bunch stuff box bother wooden doug understand,,,,

Positive,Positive,"while we have several of these wooden puzzles, this appears to be the one they didn't think through.  it's a wonderfully constructed book but easily dismantled.  my 2 year old can remove all the magnetic pieces but rarely puts them back.  and like another reviewer it must be used under complete supervision.  unlike the ""noisy"" puzzles that my son will not leave alone.  they are wonderful toys but this one really should have some improvement to it since the age range is really wrong for it.  i love it, don't get me wrong but it does need some re-thinking since it is a product that young children can take apart and with small pieces there is a choking hazard.  or at least a chance that they will get stuffed into little mouths unless properly supervised.",several wooden think wonderfully book easily year old remove magnetic rarely back reviewer complete supervision noisy leave alone wonderful really improvement age range really wrong love get wrong need product young children apart small hazard least chance get stuffed little properly,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i bought this for my daughter when she was 3.  she's now close to 5.  she gets easily frusterated with this toy since the pieces do slide around easily.  it seems like that is a common complaint with this toy.  i don't really think it's that big of a big deal.  things in life aren't always going to stay exactly how you put them.  the only time my daughter plays with this is when i'm sitting with her playing.  she usually ends up wanting me to put the pieces on the board for her.  so we make it a game where she needs to find the piece i need and tell me the color and shape of it.  my 2.5 yr old also participates. or we sort the shapes or count how many of each shape there is.  so i guess the bottom line is don't buy this toy if you don't want your child to have any frustration in life.  if you can over look the fact that the pieces do slide around easily, then this is a great toy.  i do wish it came with a decent cover or lid though!",daughter close easily toy slide around easily common complaint toy really think big big deal life going stay exactly put time daughter wanting put board make game find piece need tell color shape old count many shape guess bottom line buy toy child frustration life look fact slide around easily great toy wish decent cover lid,,,,

Positive,Positive,"preschools have similar pattern blocks and pattern sheet sets, but those are usually thin plastic.  this is nice painted wood pattern boards and sturdy wooden shapes.the pieces are small, so definitely keep away from toddlers/infants.  the largest piece is the yellow hexagons and those are about 2"" diameter (corner to corner). the smallest is the elongated white diamonds which are about 2"" long and only 1/2"" across.the pattern boards are flat, so the pieces are not going to fit into slots or indents.  that means building the pictures requires a steady hand which may frustrate some children but provides a nice challenge for those not easily frustrated.the 5 boards are double sided; the 10 pictures are:a sun/flower pattern (top right in main amazon photo)a bird (we think)a butterfly (lower right in main amazon photo)a puppy/wolf cuba snaila tug boata flower in a flowerpota rabbit (lower left in main amazon photo)a train enginea fishone of my only complaints with mellisa and doug toys (which i love, btw) hold true with this toy:  they come with incomplete storage solutions.  this has a nice divided tray but no lid!  all those little pieces and no lid--even if you store it flat, if it gets bumped, they are everywhere!  we keep the pieces in a cloth bag i had around--so you can come up with a solution, but really how hard would it have been to include a lid?  these are for little kids after all!  this is why i rated 4 stars on durable, because you won't be able to make the pictures if you loose the pieces!overall a nice sturdy set.",similar pattern pattern sheet thin plastic nice wood pattern sturdy wooden small definitely keep away largest piece yellow diameter corner corner smallest white long pattern flat going fit means building steady hand frustrate children nice challenge easily double pattern top right main amazon bird butterfly lower right main amazon tug flower rabbit lower left main amazon train doug love hold true toy incomplete storage nice tray lid little store flat everywhere keep cloth bag solution really hard include lid little durable able make loose nice sturdy set,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i asked grandma to purchase this for my 3 1/2-year-old son for christmas because we have a similar melissa and doug puzzle set that he and the kids i babysit have outgrown.  i wanted something more difficult for them to do.  i love the small pieces because they are a step up from what we already have.  contrary to other reviews, we found that the pieces match the corresponding spots perfectly.  and, despite other reviewers, no one got frustrated when the pieces were bumped out of place  two 3 1/2-year-old boys had little to no trouble with this item.  my son didn't match the pieces up exactly and he was still pleased as punch with his accomplishment.  my son's fine motor skills are not advanced for his age, so if he can do it, most other average 3-year-olds can as well.  =)  the boy i babysit is above average with his eye-hand coordination and fine motor skills, and his creations looked perfect.  just as with my other melissa and doug puzzle set, i keep the pieces in a zip lock back.  no biggie.",grandma purchase christmas similar doug puzzle set babysit wanted difficult love small step already contrary match perfectly despite frustrated place two boys little trouble match exactly still pleased punch accomplishment fine motor advanced age average well boy babysit average coordination fine motor perfect doug puzzle set keep zip lock back,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my son received this toy over three years ago.  i must admit the pattern blocks & boards wasn't a favorite, as it caused frustration.  i'd help him pull the boards out of the box, and i'd place some of the tiles close by, so he wouldn't have to reach into the box.  william would match the colors, yet he had difficulty with the tiles sliding on the boards.  he became so aggravated i put the toy away.the next time the toy came out, i put the boards up, and we started sorting the tiles.  we'd discuss the colors, the shapes, and counted the tiles.  we also started combining the tiles to make our own designs.  in time, he adjusted to the boards, and became quite good at reproducing the patterns.  now that he's 6, he likes the pattern blocks & boards.since we have many melissa & doug sets, i like that the lid is clear, so kids can identify the toy.  i wish the box had a groove on the board side so it would be easy to grasp, and remove the boards from the box.  it's a tight fit, and i have noticed william turning the entire contents out on the table, or floor because he struggles with removing the boards.  as it's completely made from wood, this set is very durable.  overall, the pattern blocks & boards is a well-made, educational toy.",received toy three ago admit pattern favorite frustration help pull box place close reach box match difficulty aggravated put toy next time toy put discuss make time adjusted good pattern many doug lid clear identify toy wish box groove board side easy grasp remove box tight fit entire table floor completely wood set durable overall pattern educational toy,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my son got this for christmas and he likes it ok, maybe as he gets older he will like it more (he is only 2.5). one of the main reasons he gets tired of it so fast is because the puzzle board is flat so the shapes do not stay in place and he gets frustrated with it and doesnt want to play with it anymore. however i knew this when i bought it so i am not going to rate it really low, but its also not gonna get 5 stars either. it does encourage developing fine motor skills and its very colorful so i am glad i bought it, i just hope my son comes around to liking it :)",christmas ok maybe older main tired fast puzzle board flat stay place frustrated play anymore going rate really low gonna get encourage developing fine motor colorful glad hope around liking,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my eighteen-month-old loves this toy.  i carried it with us to the doctor's office last week and it kept her happily occupied for a good 30 minutes.  she enjoyed stacking the pegs and putting them in the holes.  she also liked playing with the crepe rubber puzzle pieces.  she's still a little young for puzzle skills, but she'll be there soon.  in addition to the obvious, here are a few other things you can do with the toy:*use the animal pieces for mini puppet shows*use the pegs for patterning or comparing (which stack is taller?  how can we make them the same?)*play a memory game. put out the pieces and ask your child to cover his eyes while you remove a piece, then ask him to tell you what's missing.*talk about shape, colors, numbers, etc.lauri also says that they will replace lost or missing pieces.  that's a great bonus, especially for a toy meant to be carried with you.the one negative--and the reason i'm giving this toy four instead of five stars--is that the box is made out of cardboard with a velcro closure.  that's not going to last, especially if your toddler likes taking the toys out and putting them back in the box.  i'm going to put everything in a fabric drawstring bag.  if you want a quiet non-electronic toy to pull out for doctor's visits, traveling, restaurants, etc., this is a good toy.  just know that you'll probably want a different method of storage.",toy office last week happily good liked rubber puzzle still little young puzzle shell soon addition obvious animal puppet comparing stack taller make memory game put ask child cover remove piece ask tell shape replace lost missing great bonus toy reason giving toy five box cardboard velcro closure going last toddler taking back box going put everything fabric bag quiet toy pull good toy know probably different method storage,,,,

Positive,Positive,"when santa delivered this toy my boys were almost 3 yrs & just turned 5 yrs. after careful reviews this was one of two bruder trucks we purchased. the truck, because of its size, colors, and because it really works, was and is super cool to my guys. they both love it and play with it equally. will it break? it may at some time, nothing in this world is lasting, it's plastic, and played with by boys. there are no obvious plastic pieces that stick out and look as if they'd be the first to break. however, i took the time to show my boys what parts could break and how that might happen. they can sometimes be rough boys, and they carry it around the house and up and down flights of stairs, but they love their trucks. however, days go by where they didn't even touch the truck, which surprised me. then one day i dumped a bag of dried white beans into a kitchen pan of mine, placed the pan on the floor in the playroom, and showed the boys how the beans could be turned into the barrel of the mixer, or cranked out, while the beans pour out of the chute as concrete would. i have to be creative during our long wi winters. this the boys fell in love with. this changed everything. now every day the beans and concrete mixer are taken out and played with. when summer comes, i'm not too sure i like the idea of sand in the truck, any type of dried legumes, beans, or corn kernals seems preferable. as for the educational factor, we barrow library books and dvds about concrete mixers & learn the proper names of its parts, how one has to drive slower and use even greater care when driving such large equipment. the boys love it. i'm pretty frugal, and a lot of thought and research goes into each gift my children receive. this will be played with for a few years, and i am happy (with the addition of the beans) how much they play with it. it is a great purchase i recommend.update- almost 3 years have gone by since i've purchased this toy, it's still very special to my boys, it's still one of the first toys played with by visiting friends, and still in perfect condition.",santa toy boys careful two truck size really super cool love play equally break time nothing world lasting plastic boys obvious plastic stick look first break time show boys break happen rough boys carry around house love go touch truck surprised day bag white kitchen pan pan floor playroom boys barrel mixer chute concrete creative long boys love changed everything every day concrete mixer summer sure idea sand truck type corn preferable educational library concrete learn proper drive slower use greater driving large equipment boys love pretty frugal lot thought research gift children receive happy addition much play great purchase toy still special boys still first still perfect condition,,,,

Positive,Positive,"pros:- quality paint, vibrant colors, not thin or transparent- washable- great price per ouncecons:- need different containers use paint out of.- if you buy a bunch of colors, storing the bottles of paint starts to take up spacei was looking for inexpensive paint so my kids could go hog wild painting anytime they wanted without breaking the bank. my girls would burned through typical paint sets in no time. this fit the bill. i bought 10 different colors of crayola artista ii paint. you get a lot paint for your money with these 16oz jars, but you need to buy something to store the point in that is kid friendly. you're not going to be able to dip you paint brush in these paint containers. if you just squirt some on a palate, then you will end up through a lot of paint away after each painting session. you also lose a lot of paint if you rinse out a single brush between colors. my solution was to buy 10 paint cups and 10 paint brushes one for each color. it works great; my little girls have fun and don't have to worry about running out of paint.for paint containers and paint brushes i bought- chenille kraft no-spill round paint cups- chenille kraft preschool paint brush assortmenti like the bushes; a lot of brushes with good variety of styles and widths.i'm not a fan of the paint cups. they work alright, but they don't seal very well so the paint may dry out over time. see my review on the product page: http://www.amazon.com/chenille-kraft-no-spill-round-assortment/dp/b000jl54ii/ref=sr_1_3?ie=utf8&s;=toys-and-games&qid;=1280030345&sr;=8-3",quality paint vibrant thin transparent washable great price need different use paint buy bunch paint looking inexpensive paint go hog wild painting wanted without bank burned typical paint time fit bill different paint get lot paint money need buy store point kid friendly going able dip paint brush paint squirt palate lot paint away painting session lose lot paint rinse single brush solution buy paint paint color great little fun worry running paint paint kraft round paint kraft preschool paint brush lot good variety fan paint work alright seal well paint dry time see review product page,,,,

,,,,,,,
Positive,Positive,"while i've been discovering how chalks are not created equal, neither are chalkboard surfaces. this is actually perfect to chalk your board with. it's inexpensive and if you have a large board(like i do), and a few smaller ones(like i do), then this is the perfect choice because you will go through a lot of it. chalking your board makes it easier to erase any chalk. just wash(i use dawn dish soap but any household cleaner will work unless it's wall paint) your board and rinse thoroughly and dry. once your board is completely dry, take your chalk side ways and start drawing in wide strokes, covering your whole board completely. then take a dry cloth and rub/wipe the chalk into your board with a cloth. i use my sham-wow's that i've cut into smaller pieces. you will end up with chalky look, but it will be easy to wipe off any chalk. i know, you will lose the pretty and clean look, but if you rub it good enough, it will still look good. i've learned the hard way to do this with all my boards from the very expensive porcelain chalkboard to the cheapie easels. it works wonders. guess you could just wash it every time you are done, but i don't have time for that and this way the kids don't get frustrated. i only wash if the boards get gunked up.if you really want a silky and dust free chalk to write with, get the rikagaku dustless chalk. it's a bit pricey, but you won't regret it.",equal chalkboard actually perfect board inexpensive large smaller perfect choice go lot board easier erase use dawn dish soap household cleaner work wall paint board rinse dry board completely dry side start drawing wide covering whole board completely dry cloth board cloth use cut smaller look easy wipe know lose pretty clean look rub good enough still look good learned hard way expensive porcelain chalkboard guess wash every time time way get frustrated wash get really silky dust free write get bit regret,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we saw wedgits in the toy bin of a friend's toddler, and when we asked, our friend was so excited to show us this toy. ""it's the best toy ever,"" he said. then we watched him and his two-year-old assemble a fantastic tower together, take it down, build something else, and so on. we were sold.(we bought this item, the normal wedgit set, instead of the baby-safe one which has none of the smallest pieces. we simply took away the smallest pieces before putting it out for our 18-month-old, and when they're not a choking hazard anymore, we'll add them back in.)so why are wedgits the best toy? you'd have to ask a child to get the real answer, but good luck distracting them from the toy long enough to ask. basically, wedgits are an angled-stacking-toy instead of a flat-stacking-toy like building blocks. this gives them a little more stability, but also much more flexibility. you can build towers with peep-holes in the middle, weird branching structures, whatever you want.once our toddler got the hang of the fact that same-colors don't stack on each other, he's been in love with this toy. sometimes i come around a corner and find a pyramid or a tower in the middle of the floor. sometimes i go into the playroom and see him surrounded by a scattering of wedgits as he destroys one construction to start the next....and when our son's asleep, we play with the wedgits too.",saw toy toddler friend excited show toy best toy assemble fantastic tower together build else normal set none smallest simply away smallest hazard anymore well add back best toy ask child get real answer good luck distracting toy long enough ask basically building little stability much flexibility build middle weird branching whatever toddler hang fact stack love toy around corner find pyramid tower middle floor go playroom see scattering construction start asleep play,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i bought these blocks for my 3 year old grandson for christmas 2009.  my daughter actually thought that these were ""old fashioned,"" but guess what--over a month later and out of all of the toys he received, what does he play with every single day?  yes, the blocks.  when his cousins visit they, too, head for the blocks.  these blocks are durable and lead free and are brightly colored and attractive.some of the concepts that can be taught with these blocks:  colors, color grouping, , numbering, and let's not forget that stacking these blocks develop coordination and through trail and error a child learns what will and will not work. my grandson has learned that if he wants to build a tall tower he must make sure his foundation is sturdy and that the blocks are stacked evenly.  he's used mega legos since he was a one year old and i initially thought that since the new blocks didn't snap together he might get frustrated.  not so!great fun for the whole family!  highly recommended.",year old grandson christmas daughter actually thought old guess month received play every single day yes visit head durable lead free brightly colored color forget develop coordination trail error child work grandson learned build tall tower make sure foundation sturdy stacked year old thought new snap together get frustrated fun whole family highly recommended,,,,

Positive,Positive,"both of my children (5 and 2) love these blocks.  they will sit at the table and build ""castles"" and ""towers"" for an hour straight.  the box they came in is a good storage case, and the variety of shapes makes the possibilities endless.  or would if we had 3 more sets of blocks.they are small, and will not stack well on carpet.  using a hard stacking surface removes the ""tumbling"" frustration for us, except when one child wants to build and the other wants to demolish.  that's no fault of the blocks.  in my opinion, their size is great for the development of hand-eye coordination and finer motor skills.my only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that some of the paint has already begun to chip off some corners.  i am a little concerned about the long term durability, though i suppose that is purely a cosmetic issue and they will still stack even with chipped paint.",children love table build hour straight box good storage variety endless small stack well carpet using hard surface frustration except child build demolish fault opinion size great development coordination motor complaint reason paint already chip little concerned long durability suppose purely cosmetic still stack paint,,,,

Positive,Positive,"after seeing the gushing reviews here on amazon, we decided to get this &#34;toy&#34; for our almost 8-year-old. he's expressed interest in learning about electricity and how electronics worked, so i thought we would try this. in a word, he has loved it (and we have too)!cost: we bought this on amazon for roughly two-thirds of the price found in some retail stores. and, as usual with amazon, it arrived quickly and in great condition.durability: there are many small electronic components, so this is not something that younger children can get into. resisters, switches, diodes, a small motor, and integrated circuits are mounted on small, hard plastic pieces. if not cared for properly, these pieces could break. needless to say, we don't let his younger siblings near the confines while this is out on the table.the pieces snap together onto a plastic board, much like snaps on a coat or jacket work. i think that with a great amount of force, items might break, but as i already mentioned, with good care, this should last a long time -- several years, maybe even for the grandkids.educational: this is a fantastic educational kit. it starts slow with simple series circuits -- creating a light, making a motor turn, making sounds, and quickly gets more complicated. what i like about it is that you don't just build one item and go onto the next item. for example, one project has you build a &#34;space&#34; alarm. the next &#34;project&#34; then calls for you to adjust the circuit slightly and watch what happens to the noise, volume level, indicator light, etc. it helps you identify why certain things change as the circuit changes, thus giving the builder a better idea of how the electronics on the toy works.fun level: very cool to watch what the circuit does once it is completed. we've only done about 20-25 of the projects listed so far, but it has sparked imagination about what is possible.recommendation: definitely worth it for kids in 2nd grade and above. any child that has demonstrated interest in why things work or how things work would probably enjoy this set.",seeing gushing amazon decided get interest learning electricity electronics thought try word loved amazon roughly price usual amazon quickly great many small electronic younger children get small motor integrated mounted small hard plastic properly break needless say let younger near confines snap together onto plastic board much coat jacket work think great amount force break already good last long time several maybe fantastic educational kit slow simple series light motor turn quickly complicated build go onto next example project build alarm next adjust circuit slightly watch noise volume level indicator light identify certain change circuit giving builder better idea electronics toy level cool watch circuit completed weve far imagination definitely worth grade child interest work work probably enjoy set,,,,

Positive,Positive,"anyone with even the slightest electronic background will appreciate the value of this toy.  as a kid i remember the long frustrating hours of deciphering components from circuit diagrams and soldering them to create projects that were way too much effort. the limited success with these projects, i believe, is the reason i gave up my hobby.as a parent of a six-year old, i have been trying to introduce him to all facets of science and this is a wonderful tool. he immediately created a circuit - a combination light/fan circuit - in parallel and in serial - and he understood the difference between them. it was just amazing. he always appreciates what we get him, but he fell in love with this toy instantly. he was engrossed for the next hour experimenting with the various components.there are about 60 components which create a total of 300 projects. count on there being about 125-150 basic projects (i have not conducted a detail count!) with the remaining coming from tweaks in these 125-150 basic projects. however, i do not want to discount the value of these tweaks...they are designed to teach the value of electronic components and instigate independent thinking. this is definitely a ""learning"" toy. with the limited emphasis on science in our schools, the approx. [item price] is worth the investment.for people who cannot envision how these snap into place (i couldn't!), the ""snap"" is from ""snap-button"". the component is soldered onto a large piece of plastic which have snap-buttons on it. these snap-buttons snap onto a large plastic grid or onto other components. simple concept - snap-on and snap-off!!all the components have their respective symbols stamped on them which aids in early familiarization. the pieces are also individually numbered so that there is no confusion in identifying the right component. the manual is all-color and very easy to follow, however, some might prefer more detailed explanations.the model i purchased was ""snap circuit 300 with computer interface"" an upgrade to the one available here. the interface package includes software and a cable which connects to the ""line-in"" jack of your pc. the other end of the cable has two alligator-clips which can connect to any two points in your circuit. the software turns your pc into an ""oscilloscope"" so that you can ""see"" the electrical activity between any two points in your circuit. i have yet to fully learn and appreciate the value of the oscilloscope.for teenagers, there is a snap circuit 500. i believe it features more components and more complex circuits for about [item price].warning: please read up on basic electricity and explain the principles to your child. my son connected the positive and negative poles of the power supply for only 5-7 seconds - the battery heated up and popped into his hand. did not burn, but taught a valuable lesson - to me!! i should have taken the time to explain basic electricity to him. those 2 aa batteries really heated up!!if you are going to buy only one toy this year - you just found it!",slightest electronic appreciate value toy kid remember long frustrating hours circuit create way much effort limited success believe reason parent old trying introduce science wonderful tool immediately circuit combination circuit parallel difference amazing get love toy instantly engrossed next hour various create total count basic detail count coming basic discount value teach value electronic instigate independent thinking definitely learning toy limited emphasis science price worth people envision snap place snap component onto large piece plastic snap onto large plastic grid onto simple respective early confusion right component manual easy follow prefer detailed model snap circuit computer interface upgrade available interface package software cable cable two connect two circuit software see electrical activity two circuit fully learn appreciate value snap circuit believe please read basic electricity explain child connected positive negative power supply battery hand burn valuable lesson time explain basic electricity really going buy toy year,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i was a firecontrolman in the navy, its got nothing to do with firefighting but instead is an electronics intensive job. we controlled the firing of guns and missiles. move ahead 20 years and i now have a son that was interested in electronics. problem is he is too young to do a solder type of kit.when we found this it seemed to be exactly what we were looking for. within a few minutes of opening we had a working am radio! it is very simplistic and easy to follow. he has come up with circuits on his own that actually function. it was a great teaching tool to show him a resistor on the schematic, hand him the piece and have him snap it into the circuit. you build the circuits in 3 dimensions; (more on this later).pros:+ excellent way to teach kids about electronics+ many fun circuits to build from the book+ interesting results that can be assembled safely.cons:- too few pieces at times to build a circuit. what i mean is there is exactly the right number of pieces to build a radio say. because no soldering takes place you build this in 3 dimensions. some parts require you to build a bridge over another part by using risers. these pieces can be hard to find if you used them earlier on and the schematic doesn't show the 3 dimensions as well.- some of the 300 circuits offered are merely just hybrid versions of previous circuits so its not _really_ 300.summary:overall it is a fantastic kit to teach your kids about electronics. it is basic enough for people that are not trained in electronics, yet advanced enough to allow for many cool circuits to be designed.thank you for reading my review.",navy nothing electronics intensive job move ahead interested electronics problem young type exactly looking within opening radio simplistic easy follow actually function great tool show schematic hand piece snap circuit build excellent way teach electronics many fun build book interesting build circuit mean exactly right number build radio say place build require build bridge part using hard find schematic show well merely hybrid really fantastic kit teach electronics basic enough people trained electronics advanced enough allow many cool reading review,,,,

Positive,Positive,"one of my kids received this as 5th birthday gift. the age on the package is 8-108, so i wasn't sure she'd be ready for it. as it turns out--she loves building the projects and is building an understanding of how electronics work.this deluxekit comes with almost everything you need to build over 300 projects. (you will have to supply your own aaa batteries and the kit needs 4.)there are a lot of warnings with this kit, so if your child is on the younger side, prepare to be involved. do not touch the motor or fan during operation, do not connect to electrical outlets in your home (shock hazard), don't create short circuits, don't leave a project on and unattended...and there are the dreaded batteries!the snap circuits are so easy to use that my 5-year-old has no problems snapping the circuits together. where we can run into issues are with the reading of the project diagrams (she is only 5, after all). if a component is placed on the board upside down, you might not be able to complete the circuit correctly. however, the pieces are easy enough to snap on and snap off.  the project diagrams are pretty easy to follow. they show the layout of the circuit, placement on the board, and the order in which to stack the pieces. each project lists an objective, an explanation of what should happen when you turn the switch on, and any changes you should see when you make adjustments to the circuit. if there are any special warnings, like not to touch the spinning motor, those will be listed, too.one of our favorite projects is the dc motor & switch project. it shows how electricity is used to run a direct current (dc) motor. the circuit is a very simple design and you attach a plastic fan to the top of the motor. the motor spins so fast that the fan flies up into the air like a &#34;flying saucer&#34;.  another project, the lamp & fan in series, adds an led to the circuit. the light, which turns on at the same time as the fan, will prevent the motor from getting the full voltage. the fan will spin, but will not fly into the air. while not really understanding the details, the kids did notice that the fan spins faster in one project than the other.there are a variety of other projects including games, burglar alarms, night lights, and more.the projects only take a few minutes to complete. the more complicated projects can take a little longer because they have more pieces. depending on the purpose of the project, you might play with it for only a few minutes (slide the switch to make a sound) or longer (the flying saucer because it's fun).  this seems like a perfect rainy day activity. and with over 300 projects, you can make projects for hours...",received birthday gift age package sure shed ready building building understanding electronics everything need build supply kit lot kit child younger side prepare involved touch motor fan operation connect electrical home shock hazard create short leave project dreaded snap easy use together run reading project component board upside able complete circuit correctly easy enough snap snap project pretty easy follow show circuit placement board order stack project objective explanation happen turn switch see make circuit special touch motor favorite motor switch project electricity run direct current motor circuit simple design attach plastic fan top motor motor fast fan air project lamp fan series led circuit light time fan prevent motor full voltage fan spin fly air really understanding notice fan faster project variety including games burglar night complete complicated little longer purpose project play slide switch make sound longer fun perfect rainy day activity make hours,,,,

Positive,Positive,"our five-year old son received this as a christmas gift last year.  after a year of use, he still enjoys playing with it.  all of the parts and the board itself are well constructed from heavy-duty plastic.the board, which acts as the base for all the electrical designs, has several &#34;pegs&#34; on it which all the electrical circuits snap onto.  the board has an alphanumeric grid which corresponds to the layout of the circuits in the user's manual.  the user looks at the manual, grabs the necessary component, and snaps it into place on the board.  when two or more components stack on top of each other, the directions indicate if the component is on level one, two, three, etc.  this tells the user that all components on level one should be placed on the board first, those labeled two placed second, and so on.  it's a very ingenious way of telling the user how to construct the circuit.  the pictures are very clear and well laid out.once the circuit has been built, i'll read the explanation to my son so he knows what to expect when he turns the switch on.  likewise, i tell him what each piece is and point to it as i'm reading the description to him; resistors, led lights, speakers, etc.  he's learning more about electricity and circuits than i ever did at his age and up until college.the circuit board operates on two aa batteries for most designs.  the remaining circuits use four aa batteries.  we opted for the ac adapter to save on buying batteries.  but, at one year later, have hardly used the adapter.  i probably wouldn't buy it if i had to do all over again.  with all the batteries we buy for other toys we've always got an ample stock in the house.  the adapter was just another expense we probably didn't need.  that being said, it does work well and we have had no problems with it.kids who like to create and build things with their hands, such as legos & trio blocks, should enjoy the snap circuits sc-300.  this does not require any tools whatsoever.",old received christmas gift last year year use still board well board base electrical several electrical snap onto board alphanumeric grid manual user manual necessary component place board two stack top directions indicate component level two three user level board first two second ingenious way telling user construct circuit clear well circuit read explanation expect switch tell piece point reading description led learning electricity age circuit board two use adapter save buying year hardly adapter probably buy buy weve ample stock house adapter expense probably need work well create build trio enjoy snap require,,,,

Positive,Positive,"the sc-300 kit, with its over 60 parts and 300 documented projects could be viewed as the entry-level option of a series that include general purpose models sc-500 (75 parts, 500 projects), sc-750 (80 parts, 750 projects) and special kits such as model scrov-10 that would involve the building of a remote control snap rover.snap circuits stimulates a child's curiosity and understanding of electricity and electronics as well as the child's creativity.it would be difficult to overstate how impressed i am with this set but that won't mean much because i'm a grownup. the good thing is that my 2 boys, 12 and 13 found it interesting too. they've been building 'devices' shortly after opening the box and, a few projects later, they were already building their own variations and seeking explanations of 'why' certain changes worked while others didn't. i am not sure about including 8 or 9 yr. olds in the recommended age range but, by the time they are 11-12, most kids should be naturally curious about what is it that makes electronics work the way they do and this kit helps them to begin to understand what it is that's making our increasingly intelligent machines act the way they do.contentsthe kit includes a large number of electronic components: wires, switches, lamps, diodes, resistors, transistors, capacitors, motor, microphone, special purpose integrated circuits.the plastic base grid simulates a printed circuit board in that it allows the components to snap in place making it easy for the schematics presented in the manuals to look exactly as illustrated.the 2 manuals ""projects 1-101"" and ""projects 102-305"" complete the kit.operation and educational valueeach of the two manuals includes brief tutorials on how to use and how to troubleshoot a project. they also provide brief descriptions of each of the parts, explaining how they work. the do's and don'ts section should be read by both parents and children before beginning, especially the section on short circuits and what one should never do.once the children have a basic understanding of 'circuits' and what they should not do if they are to prevent destroying some of the parts, they are ready to begin and begin they will.each individual project, usually presented on half page includes:- project number, name and objective.- a colorful schematic showing exactly the parts to be used and exactly where on the base grid they should be placed.- a couple of paragraphs of text explaining how to proceed with assembly, what to expect and, more importantly why.projects range from the simplest circuit - battery, lamp and switch - to building logic gates and transistor radios.children will not learn physics and will not be able to fix tvs after completing these projects but this practice, hopefully combined with the help of a grownup, they will gain some understanding of 'why' and 'how' some of our gadgets perform some of their functions. if their curiosity is stimulated to the degree that they seek to learn and understand more, this kit should be viewed as a good investment.my own experience showed the kids almost immediately thinking of variations to the projects the book was instructing them to build - replacing the light bulb with a motor or the 'whistler' to see what happens or, once they understood how 'circuits' worked, trying to build and test 'parallel' circuits on their own.my ratingeverything is right with this kit and i can't think of anything wrong, really. we are not through with all 300 projects yet but the first 50 generated at least twice as many variations. for the money, it can't get much better than this.it's 5 stars without reservations except for the suggested age group. except maybe for the genius sons and daughters of electronic engineers, i would say that 10 and older is more realistic than 'over 8'.",kit documented option series include general purpose special model involve building remote control snap curiosity understanding electricity electronics well difficult overstate set mean much grownup good boys interesting building shortly opening box already building certain others sure including recommended age range time naturally curious electronics work way kit begin understand intelligent act way kit large number electronic motor special purpose integrated plastic base grid circuit board snap place easy look exactly complete educational two brief use troubleshoot project provide brief work section read children beginning section short children basic understanding prevent ready begin begin individual project half page project number objective colorful schematic exactly exactly base grid couple text proceed assembly expect importantly range simplest circuit battery lamp switch building logic transistor learn able fix practice hopefully help grownup gain understanding perform curiosity degree seek learn understand kit good experience immediately thinking book build light bulb motor see trying build test parallel right kit think wrong really first least many money get much better without except age group except maybe genius electronic say older realistic,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we got this seat as a gift from my mother-in-law at our shower.  the plan was for it to be a second car seat until she outgrew her carrier.  well, our lil' monkey is pretty long and has great head control so she is now using this as her primary carseat at 3 months old.it is lighweight and easy to install in every car we've had it in (everything from an altima to a durango). the teather strapes are the perfect length and once they are secured that thing will not move!  it reclines in snap and the belts adjust with ease.  i'm not sure what some found difficult about them.  the belts are also easily adjusted for height too.  it is also easily cleaned when yo uhave a minor spill.our daughter likes it better than her carrier becasue it sits her up higher and she can see out the back window if we position her just right.  it sitting her up higher also makes her easier for us to see in her mirror.all in all, this seat is great and we are getting a second one soon so we can stop switching it from car to car.",seat gift shower plan second car seat carrier well lil monkey pretty long great head control using primary carseat easy install every car weve everything perfect length move snap adjust ease sure difficult easily adjusted height easily cleaned minor daughter better carrier higher see back window position right higher easier see seat great second soon stop switching car car,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i bought this car seat to replace the cosco alpha omega i had. we found that the ao with the shield was a hazard to use and the shield would bust off just from use. (found out from someone who works for cosco. we decided on this seat since the adjustment knobs are easy to get in the rear facing position. i love the fact that the straps don't twist like the ones on my older son's toddler booster. my youngest son loves his carseat, he only complains when first being placed in it since he wants his soft toy car seat steering wheel right away. he is very comfortable in his seat. he always screamed and cried in his old seat until he fell asleep because he couldn't really see that well over the shield. adjusting the straps while the child is in the seat is a little difficult at first, but after 2 tries, it was a breeze. i would recommend this seat to anyone.the only bad thing i have found that is a little annoying, is how far apart the straps are and that they easily slip off the baby's shoulder until you have the straps tightened. i always have to make sure the straps are over his shoulders before i tighten the straps more snugly. this only seems to be a problem while the child is rear facing and the straps are below shoulder level like they are supposed to be. once forward facing the straps shouldn't slip off since they will be above shoulder level. overall this is a great seat.",car seat replace alpha omega shield hazard use shield bust use decided seat adjustment easy get rear position love fact twist older toddler booster carseat first soft toy car seat steering wheel right away comfortable seat old seat asleep really see well shield child seat little difficult first breeze recommend seat bad little annoying far apart easily slip shoulder make sure tighten snugly problem child rear shoulder level forward slip shoulder level overall great seat,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i have spent about 2 hours researching on the internet for which convertible car seat was the safest, simplest, most comfortable and affordable for our 5 month old baby girl, who still needs to be rear-facing for another 7 months. her former carseat (eddie bauer travel system w/base) was making us crazy because to have the handle down, it required the passenger side seat to be scooted up to where your knees were practically in your chest in our '98 corolla.  we couldn't imagine doing that for another 3-6 months.  so, we started looking. i was disappointed first of all to discover the last study consumer reports did on car seats was june 2001. so much has changed since then and their top picks (fisher price) are no longer on the market. so, i read a ton of parent reviews and tried to use what was left on the june consumer report. i narrowed down the choices to the triump 5, the graco comfortsport & the ever-popular britax roundabout.  we tried out the first two in the store. the triumph 5 immediately caught my eye because of it's comfort factor and shape. when we put her in it, she seemed happy and as if she was in a recliner.  the comfortsport seemed less padded, more boxy and bigger (although it is lighter). we also chose the triumph seat because of the knobs on the side of the seat that adjust the straps (instead of buried against the seat).  it's so easy to make adjustments. also, i like the fact that it has 5 reclining positions. i took the new seat to a car safety check yesterday and the officers and volunteers were very impressed with the design, features (especially the knobs on the side) and one told me that it was in the same class as the britax (but of course [$$$] less!).  also, with the seat rear-facing and in the middle of the backseat, both driver and passenger seats are able to go back to almost their maximum setting! no more knees in the dashboard!",hours internet convertible car seat safest simplest comfortable affordable month old baby girl still carseat travel system crazy handle passenger side seat practically chest imagine looking disappointed first discover last study consumer car much changed top fisher price longer market read parent tried use left consumer report roundabout tried first two store triumph immediately eye comfort shape put happy less boxy bigger lighter triumph seat side seat adjust seat easy make fact new seat car safety check yesterday design side class course less seat middle backseat driver passenger able go back maximum setting dashboard,,,,

Positive,Positive,"these mats are great. they are easy to clean. i just run the vaccum cleaner over them with the brush off, then i mop them when i do the rest of the house. i also found them in other colors at target to included a blue camo, a pink camo and green. tyhe camo ones can be used on either side. the reverse side of the blue camo ones is a light blue, and pink for the pink ones. we have wood floors and theses are great to go over them. they are also good for toys that move by themselves. carpet sometimes slows toys like this down and wood floors really aren't that fun to lay on, so this is reat. i dropped a ceraminc piggy bank from 4 1/2 feeet up on to them and it didn't break. they can be a bit slippery especially the ones with the camo on them for kids with socks. bare feet of socks with the grips on the bottom are good for this, but if you live in a house where you have wood florrs, that is probally the only kind of socks you buy anyways. overall great product and they can be found in other colors you just need to be on the lookout.",great easy clean run cleaner brush mop rest house target blue pink green side reverse side blue light blue pink pink wood great go good move carpet wood really fun lay piggy bank break bit slippery bottom good live house wood kind buy overall great product need lookout,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i bought this for my daughter when she was two years old and she immediately loved it.  she loved the blinking lights and the songs for each of the letters.  it also identifies each letter with an example word and plays a few other tunes, like ""old macdonald had a farm"".  there are two volume settings, loud and soft, and soft is pretty reasonable, while loud isn't super loud either.  the toy is very durable.  even a child who is rough with toys would have a hard time breaking it.the only thing my daughter doesn't like about it is the games.  i think the only minus for parents would be they the tunes might get stuck in their heads.  it's awfully embarrassing to find yourself singing ""the letter b really swings/it's the song it sings!"" while at work.  other parents might understand, but everyone else will look at you funny.overall, i would recommend this for parents with toddlers.",daughter two old immediately loved loved letter example word old farm two volume loud soft soft pretty reasonable loud super loud toy durable child rough hard time daughter games think minus get stuck awfully embarrassing find singing letter really song sings work understand everyone else look recommend,,,,

Positive,Positive,"bought these for my daughter when she was one years old but she didn't actually play with them until she was 18 months old. she doesn't normally chew on things unless she is teething so i wasn't too worried about colors or wood splinters. since then she has been building towers with them and they just keep getting taller and taller and more complicated.i know a lot of reviewers are surprised that they are so small, 1"" x 1"" x 1"", but they are supposed to help children manipulate them and place them and learn about various things like balance. i asked a child development specialist what i should definitely not miss out on in terms of toys and he mentioned 1"" blocks! i think they even use them as a milestone test or something.now that she's two plus, she enjoys the letters and numbers and has begun using them to make collections of colors or pictures on a theme. i actually think i'm going to get more use out of them in the upcoming months as she starts recognising more and more letters.------september 2012 update - she can read! :) and i found out thanks to these blocks. trust me, two weeks earlier she couldn't and then i overhear her putting them together and saying phonetically, 'c', 'u', 'p' - cup. i then asked her to read and spell out pot, cat, sat, hot, dot, mat, bat etc. :) her school gets the credit for the phonics, but these blocks get the credit for me getting to watch her in action!",daughter old actually play old chew teething worried wood building keep taller taller know lot surprised small help children manipulate place learn various balance child development specialist definitely miss think use test two plus using make actually think going get use upcoming update read thanks trust two together phonetically cup read spell hot dot mat bat school credit get credit watch action,,,,

Positive,Positive,"purchased this kitchen from toysrus.com and just received it a few days ago. it took my husband *maybe* 10 minutes max to put together. the directions are fairly useless as all they show are pictures and aren't *that* clear but it could not be more simple to put together. not too many screws and some snap in pieces. the stickers came all crumbled but i was able to salvage them somewhat but will contact little tikes for a replacement set (due to a poor packaging job on their part, i've had stickers from almost all of their products arrive in that condition).ok, on to the features, pro's & con's.... the kitchen in my opinion is the perfect size, not too little not too overwhelming. it fit perfectly in my kitchen (which is not large at all) and my son loves cooking right next to me. he loves the microwave but he's still a little short for it (he's 21 months) but stands on his tippy toes and that's fine (he will have lots of time to really grow with this kitchen in a variety of ways). the microwave is fabulous and i took the tip of another reviewer to not put the popcorn sticker on it which was an excellent tip, otherwise you can't see what's inside and my son loves to check out what's ""cooking"" in there. also, as another reviewer said the microwave door doesn't completely close but it's close enough and i think the only people that actually care about these little nuances are us parents:)  same thing with the oven door, that doesn't completely close either (it's a little ill-fitting) but completely unimportant. my son loves loves loves when it's says ""what would you like to cook""? ...""a hot dog"", ""eggs and bacon"" etc. he gets so excited from the sizzling sounds and that it ""speaks to him"", he also loves the sound of the running water and pushing the puttons on the microwave. i also must say little tikes did a fantastic job with the voice work on this kitchen. the voices are all little kids and they are sooooo cute, and speak very very clearly which i love. yes, it is a little loud but a very easy fix is a piece of clear packing tape over the voice box which can easily be accessed under the black ""grill"", it made a huge difference, now it's just right. the only real con i can say about this kitchen is, it would have been nice if the dishwasher and the oven opened just like a regular one not side to side but i do understand why they made it this way. i think they incorporated just the right about of sounds into this kitchen as well, enough to be engaging and not too much to take away from using their imagination. the colors are awesome, nice and clean and modern looking and the best part gender neutral! i know some people love the look of the step2 kitchen but i personally think it's old fashioned looking, dark and dreary and an eye sore -- this is fun and fresh! i know they don't sell additional food for this kitchen but really don't think you need any more sizzling and cooking food that's interactive. i will buy additional play food but what they provided that works on the stove (eggs and bacon, hot dog on a bun, mac and cheese, spaghetti & meatballs & chicken) is truly sufficient. my only concern as others have stated is losing these pieces because they don't sell replacements...yet. but, i decided to make it into a learning game with my son and teach him that food and cooking utensils do not leave the kitchen i.e. so we don't lose the pieces (so far so good;)i highly recommend this kitchen and feel that it's a wonderful toy for a toddler on up that will help foster their imagination and bring many years of smiles and laughter. it's very well made as are all little tikes products are and i love how easy it is to clean. all drumsticks up on this one!",kitchen received ago husband maybe max put together directions fairly useless show clear simple put together many snap able salvage somewhat contact little replacement set due poor job part arrive kitchen opinion perfect size little fit perfectly kitchen large right next still little short tippy fine time really grow kitchen variety fabulous tip reviewer put popcorn sticker excellent tip see inside check reviewer completely close close enough think people actually little oven completely close little completely unimportant cook hot bacon excited sizzling sound running water pushing say little fantastic job voice work kitchen little cute speak clearly love yes little loud easy fix piece clear tape voice box easily black grill huge difference right real say kitchen nice dishwasher oven regular side side understand way think right kitchen well enough much away using imagination awesome nice clean modern looking best part gender neutral know people love look kitchen personally think old looking dark dreary eye sore fun fresh know sell additional food kitchen really think need sizzling food interactive buy additional play food stove bacon hot bun cheese spaghetti chicken truly sufficient concern others stated sell decided make learning game teach food leave kitchen lose far highly recommend kitchen feel wonderful toy toddler help foster imagination bring many laughter well little love easy clean,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we had a hand-me down kitchen since my first b/g twins were 18 months, they are now 3 and have 8 month old twin brothers. we decided that a pink kitchen wasnt fit for our family, so we went in search of a new one. it was between this one and the dream kitchen. they were both, non gender specific, and both interactive. we liked this one better because the colors are more appealing to kids (atleast it was to our 3 year olds in toys r us) and that it is a little more interactive. of course this kitchen should be for pretend, but its nice that you can put eggs on the stove and it will tell you what it is, you can also buy additional interactive foods from toysrus and from amazon. it is very durable and has held up to much abuse. my 3 year olds love to cook when mommy does (ours is in the kitchen and the old one is in the playroom). we have a lot of dishes and food, and for the ones that dont fit in the kitchen, we put in a small basket next to it. its big enough for about 3-4 toddlers to play with at a time. it encourages sharing and cooaperation. my kids have alot of fun with it and they espcially like the oven, who knows why! i think this kitchen is great, cute friendly and a little more interactive than the lifestyles!",kitchen first month old twin decided pink kitchen fit family search new dream kitchen gender specific interactive liked better appealing year little interactive course kitchen pretend nice put stove tell buy additional interactive amazon durable much abuse year love cook mommy kitchen old playroom lot food fit kitchen put small basket next big enough play time alot fun oven think kitchen great cute friendly little interactive,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i decided to try these for my 4 yr old's room, despite the somewhat negative reviews. he loves learning about the planets, and also loves the glow in dark stars on his ceiling so i thought these would make a great addition. and they are wonderful!! we are so in love with them every night when the lights go out. the plastic is lightweight so they can easily hang from fishline, not necessarily cheap. assembling the planets and stringing them to fishline is fairly easy. tying a little loop on the other end to hang from the pin took a little patience, but not too bad. the star-shaped pins hold them securely to ceiling with no problem. the different colors and patterns make each planet glow brighter or dimmer, for a realistic touch. i will agree a downfall is the sheet of glow stars they include....they are tiny, could fit on my thumbnail. but they are great filler stars if you buy some larger glow stars to fill the ceiling, and i highly recommend you do! the star sets made by great explorations & university games are great, or the jar of stars made by the toysmith are great too - all available on amazon. the key is to get sets with different size stars, it really makes your ceiling universe pop. i was so impressed by how amazing his room looked at night....that i bought another set of planets and large set of stars for our room (keep watch on these, as amazon often puts them on sale - i got mine for $9.99 w/ free s/h!) and now i'm so in love with my nighttime universe, as much as my little boy! i look forward to gazing at it every night before my eyes quickly close on another exhausting wonderful day.",decided try room despite somewhat negative learning glow dark ceiling thought make great addition wonderful love every night go plastic lightweight easily hang necessarily cheap fairly easy little loop hang pin little patience bad hold securely ceiling problem different make planet glow realistic touch agree downfall sheet glow tiny fit great filler buy larger glow fill ceiling highly recommend star great university games great jar great available amazon key get different size really ceiling universe pop amazing room set large set room keep watch amazon often free love nighttime universe much little boy look forward every night quickly close exhausting wonderful day,,,,

Positive,Positive,"the educational value of having the planets hang from our son's room is great.  at 4 years-old, he could name the nine planets thanks in large part to this ""toy"".  so i give it the highest marks in educational value.  a little tid-bit about each of the planets is provided on a panthlet in this set and i read it to our son as my husband hung the set.  our son actually memorized much of what i read to him and when the set was new he asked me to reread the panthlet to him several times to fill in the pieces of information that he had forgotten.it's also fun in that our son enjoys showing it to our guests and telling them about the planets.  however, i rate the set as 4 out of 5 stars in the fun category simply because it is more like decoration.  this set hangs from the ceiling, so you never play with it or even touch it once it is hung.  you simply enjoy looking at it and talking about it.the downside of this set is that the stars are really small stickers so you will want to purchase some larger glow-in-the-dark stars.  also it is a pain to hang this set since you have to tie fishing line to each of the planets and then use tack-like objects to connect them to the ceiling.  but once you have it all set up your child will probably be pleased.",educational value hang room great nine thanks large part toy give highest educational value little tidbit set read husband set actually much read set new several fill information fun telling rate set fun category simply decoration set ceiling play touch simply enjoy looking talking downside set really small purchase larger pain hang set tie fishing line use connect ceiling set child probably pleased,,,,

Positive,Positive,"the most tedious part of this set, for me, was putting saturn's ring into place.  hanging it was not hard.  i used putty that i had bought from the store, i just figured it would work better than the included putty.  i installed this whole thing myself (stay at home mom), with a 1 year old and a 3.5 year old and a huge ladder, everyone in the same room that includes a thomas the train table to work around, and i was able to get them up in no time.  i used the smoke detector as the ""sun"" and lined them up from there.  my 3.5 year old knows the name, and color of every planet after 1 hour.  so i would say it is educational.the kit glows well, really well.  the stars included are what you would expect. they are kind of poor.  i bought a tube of the 3d stars by the same company.  it is a tube of just 30 stars.  i placed putty on them and stuck them to the ceiling.  i just figured the stars should have some dimension like the planets.  1 tube was enough for the whole ceiling.the room looks great.  i highly recommend the tube of 30 3d stars too!  they are also fantastic!  we have them in both kids rooms.  if you buy them, you will need to use a different brand of putty to hang them to your ceiling.  my husband hung the stars by string in my daughters with the included putty and they all fell.  i stuck them flat with a different putty and they are fine.i cannot tell you if they glow for an acceptable amount of time b/c i don't use them as a night light.  that seems like an unrealistic expectation of anything glow in the dark.  i use a really dim night light and my children can still see the bright stars over the dim night light.  and i am able to check on them later without walking around in a dark room.  in the day time i wish there was a sun, but at night time i wouldn't want it so it isn't that big of a deal to me that it isn't in the kit.  still haven't figured out what to do with pluto though...",tedious part set ring place hard store work better whole stay home mom year old year old huge ladder everyone room train table work around able get time smoke detector sun year old color every planet hour say kit well really well expect kind poor tube company tube stuck ceiling dimension tube enough whole room great highly recommend tube fantastic buy need use different brand hang ceiling husband string stuck flat different tell glow acceptable amount time use night light unrealistic expectation glow dark use really dim night light children still see bright dim night light able check without around dark room day time wish sun night time big deal kit still,,,,

Positive,Negative,"we found this product in our local toy shop and for $15 i figured why not.  of course my 4 year old thinks the object of the game is to get the pirate to shoot out so that's always our goal.  the plastic that the knives are made out of are decent and have some flex to them to wiggle them into the slots (which occassionally you do have to tweak it just right), the plastic that the barrel is made out of is a bit cheap.  the spring that causes the pirate to shoot out is decent and so the pirate gets decent height (see the picture album for an example.)the biggest complaint that i am seeing in the lesser starred reviews is that the spot to eject the pirate is always the same.  this is user error and not the fault of the game.  the way that you randomize the pop up spot is with the pressure peg that the pirate ultimately rests on.  before you push it down to reset it - you simply twist it this causes the location of the ""the spot"" to change.my son plays this over and over and over again.  he's made that pirate pop up at least 100 times.  there have been about 5 times in that 100 that he gets all the knives in and the pirate didn't pop.  so it's not 100% accurate, but for less than 10% error on the part of the popping pirate there is no fun lossed.  if this product cost more than $20 i might complain about the general quality of it all, but for under $15 you really can't go wrong with the element of fun that it has associate with it.if you have a child that loves pirates this is a must.",product local toy shop course year old game get pirate shoot goal plastic decent flex wiggle tweak right plastic barrel bit cheap spring pirate shoot decent pirate decent height see picture album biggest complaint seeing lesser spot eject pirate user error fault game way pop spot pressure peg pirate push reset simply twist location spot pirate pop least pirate pop accurate less error part pirate fun product cost complain general quality really go wrong element fun associate child,,,,

Positive,Positive,"on the surface, pop-up pirate looks like it's aimed towards the younger crowd, but underneath that kiddy exterior is a game so complex and demanding that we mensa members even bust it out occasionally. what you don't know is that pop-up pirate uses super-advanced algorithms and formulas to determine what slit will blow that silly little pirate's top off.it is very hard to explain, but i will try to put as best as i can in layman's terms. every slit and sword color combination produces a certain number. for example; slit #17, combined with a red sword, produces the number 678. this number by itself means nothing, but once another sword is put in the barrel, a certain condition is made. for example; slit #12 with a blue sword followed by slit #8 with a green sword produces the condition ""factor of 4"". subsequent numbers that are produced must adhere to this condition, or else the pirate pop meter raises by 1. when the meter reaches 5, the pirate of course pops out of the barrel. the meter may raise more than 1 depending on the severity of a produced number's unfaithfulness to the condition, but we're not sure yet how this severity is measured.another factor to the game is where exactly the pirate lands. the location were his head meets the ground will affect the pirate pop meter in the next match. we believe that is the pirate lands on his northwestern quadrant, the pirate pop meter changes its maximum capacity to 7 in the next match. this is only a claim, but rest assured we are doing extensive testing to prove this and other hypotheses.so you see, to you it is but a simple child's game. to us here at mensa, it is an ongoing intelligent battle that we may never come to fully understand unless we preform at our very best.",surface popup pirate younger crowd underneath exterior game demanding mensa bust occasionally know popup pirate determine slit blow silly little top hard explain try put best every slit sword color combination certain number example slit red sword number number means nothing sword put barrel certain condition example slit blue sword slit green sword condition subsequent adhere condition else pirate pop meter meter pirate course barrel meter raise severity unfaithfulness condition sure severity game exactly pirate location head ground affect pirate pop meter next match believe pirate pirate pop meter maximum capacity next match claim rest assured extensive testing prove see simple game mensa intelligent battle fully understand preform best,,,,

Positive,Positive,"a few years ago, we bought the book, the scrambled states of america, from a school book fair.  my son loved the colorful, silly illustrations of the states, and the funny concepts of states getting bored with where they are on the map and deciding to switch places.  in the story, all the states loved their new locales at first, loved the weather changes, loved the different neighbors they had.  after a while, florida caught a cold.  montana lost part of itself into the ocean.  you get the idea.  the book is a fresh way to learn about geography.  instead of rote memorization, the kids had fun trying to locate all the states on the maps, and trying to remember which states we'd been to and how we drove/flew from place to place.when i saw the game in our local toy store, i thought it might be an amusing extension of the book concept.  it was a bit expensive, i thought, for two decks of cards and a few paperback maps.  but we had many other game wright games and believed the company's philosophy of designing fresh, creative games that required out-of-the-box thinking and beautiful graphics.i was delighted when we started to play the game.  the game, as it is designed, requires some basic ability to read.  the 50 ""state cards"" have state names, capitals, nicknames, and an illustration of the state shape on them.  the 60 ""scramble cards"" have instructions to find state cards within each player's hand with certain criteria, such as ""state name that starts and ends with a vowel,"" ""state closest to tennessee,""  or ""nickname that contains a person's name.""  other scramble cards ask for players to identify the card in their hands that are closest to another state.  we had an instance of this challenge (called a ""go the distance"" challenge) with hawaii--- we had to decide which state was closer, new mexico, oregon, or washington.all players are provided with their own little maps with funny states on them, as a reference.the kids loved playing the game, and did not consider it an ""education.""  it was just fun to play.  i would love to see a game like this with countries of the world.  good job, game wright!  you knocked it out of the park again.  other game wright games i would recommend are sleeping queens, match of the penguins, dweebies, wig out, and moose in the house.  yes, we bought all of them...and were glad we did.",ago book scrambled america school book fair loved colorful silly funny bored map deciding switch story loved new first loved weather loved different cold lost part ocean get idea book fresh way learn geography rote memorization fun trying locate trying remember place saw game local toy store thought extension book bit expensive thought two paperback many game wright games philosophy fresh creative games thinking beautiful play game game basic ability read state state illustration state shape scramble find state within hand certain criteria state vowel state closest nickname scramble ask identify card closest state challenge go distance challenge decide state closer new little funny loved game consider education fun play love see game world good job game wright park game wright games recommend sleeping match wig moose house yes glad,,,,

Positive,Positive,"the following review was written by ty, one of my 4th grade students:the scrambled states game is a fast pace learning game that my classmates like to play at  indoor recess when its raining or snowing. this game is so fun that when you play it once you will have to play it again and again. this whimsical mad-dashing geography game is fun for the whole family.how to play :this game can have up to four players and is ages eight and up. you will start by giving each player a u.s. map and shuffling the state (blue) and the scramble (red) cards. do not mix them. you must deal five cards out to each player. put your cards in a row. when you turn up a find it card you do what it says and try to find a match on your cards row. to start the game you turn over a find it card in the scramble deck. if you have a match to a find it card you slap the card and say the state on the card. when ending the game or the scrambled pile is depleted players count their home pile. that is the pile that you put your state cards in after you have found a match. the winner is the one who has the most states home. there will be an occasional ""go the distance"" cards and in that case you flip over the next state card and the closest one to that state gets to go home. this is a fun indoor recess game and an even more fun as a family game.pros: this game very easy to set up and put away. this game is also easily able to be stored away and can almost fit anywhere.cons: this game can loose cards easily. the game cards and box can tear easily and be broken if not taken care of.",following review grade scrambled game fast pace learning game play indoor game fun play play whimsical geography game fun whole play game eight start giving player map state blue scramble red mix deal five player put row turn find card try find match row start game turn find card scramble deck match find card slap card say state card ending game scrambled pile depleted count home pile pile put state match winner home occasional go distance flip next state card closest state go home fun indoor game fun family game easy set put away game easily able away fit game loose easily game box tear easily broken,,,,

Positive,Negative,"this is the nerf reactor. it's a pump action blaster that fires round rigid foam balls about the size of golf balls. i am a nerf afficianado and have used lots of nerf guns, from the single-shot pistols to the full automatic ones, and it seems like i always grab this one when the battles get going. the reactor is basically a tube with a spring loaded follower inside, a stationary pistol grip at the rear and a pump action sliding hande at the front. the muzzle has a rubber seal inside to hold the balls in until fired.it's super-simple. no clips to load, handles to cock, or sights, sort of like a shotgun. there's not much to go wrong either. all you so is rack the pump. it holds 5 foam balls. the box came with four, which i thought was weird. why not give us 5 nerf?firing is also super-simple. just push the balls into the front and pump the handle. that's it! unlike some other blasters, it has never jammed, failed to fire, or disappoint me. i love the loud pop noise it makes, and the balls do fly pretty far. distance depends on how fast you pump the handle, and i could get good distance out of it. you can also fire it quickly, i can get off all 5 shots in under 4 seconds! as a note, even though the balls are rigid foam, they aren't that heavy and don't have much power behind them so even a hit to the face wouldn't hurt much, unlike a smaller dart that's flying faster.there is a slight problem though, and a big one for some. the issue is that it does take extra effort to get it to work. it's not like pulling a trigger and letting the gun do the work. even cocking a handle on other nerf blasters is easier than this. a  five or six year-old probably (you never know though!) wouldn't be able to fire this, so it does limit it to older kids.pro'slots of funsuper simplecool popping noiselightcontakes a bit of effort to work it, so it's really designed for older kids.overall, i really like the reactor. it's a classic nerf blaster that will keep going for years. i highly recommend it to anyone who loves to have fun.",pump action round rigid foam size golf full automatic grab get going basically tube spring loaded follower inside stationary pistol grip rear pump action front muzzle rubber seal inside hold load cock shotgun much go wrong rack pump foam box thought weird give push front pump handle fire disappoint love loud pop noise fly pretty far distance depends fast pump handle get good distance fire quickly get note rigid foam heavy much power behind hit hurt much smaller dart slight problem big extra effort get work trigger gun work handle easier five six probably know able fire limit older bit effort work really older really classic keep going highly recommend fun,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i have wanted to buy a musini for my son for a few years now, but never found one in a retail store, online or local. i recently gave in and bought one gently used on ebay for a fantastic price including the cartridge. my entire family loves it, including my 2-year-old son. it was very easy to figure out how to use, even without a manual. on the battery case are very clear, easy to follow instructions on how to calibrate the sensitivity of your musini. within minutes we had found the perfect setting for our carpeted living room and we were all dancing. even my parents who came to visit one night were bopping to the musini! my dad couldn't keep his feet still, insisting on drumming them on the floor constantly to keep the music going when my toddler had taken a seat to rest for a minute. i have found myself taking it out during my son's nap time to put near me while i do the mundane chores around the house. it is really addicting and keeps us all moving!i can't say enough good things about this toy. the music quality is absolutely wonderful and is clear and crisp and a joy to listen to. you also tend to feel like you are actually playing an instrument when you're dancing around or even sitting on the floor tapping your fingers. the songs are mostly familiar and well-loved songs that you will instantly recognize. i have also noticed that you can use the musini to up your child's physical activity. if you change the sensitivity so that they must jump or stomp hard, you suddenly have an even greater outlet for energy and a great source of exercise! you can, of course, adjust the sensitivity so that a single finger tap across the room will register. it's up to you, and i think it's fantastic! highly recommended!",wanted buy store online local recently gently fantastic price including entire family including easy figure use without manual battery clear easy follow calibrate sensitivity within perfect setting living room dancing visit night dad keep still floor constantly keep music going toddler seat rest minute taking nap time put near mundane around house really addicting say enough good toy music quality absolutely wonderful clear crisp joy listen tend feel actually instrument dancing around floor mostly familiar instantly recognize use physical activity change sensitivity jump stomp hard suddenly greater outlet energy great source exercise course adjust sensitivity single finger tap room register think fantastic highly recommended,,,,

Positive,Positive,"neurosmith makes good toys. they're well made, durable, and stylish. their new hit, musini, is no exception to this.however, let's not go overboard on the praise.musini is a ""dance synthesizer"". it creates patterns of music based on sensors that track vibrations on the surface on which the device is placed. while the ads would have you believe it is truly a sophisticated movement tracker, it is limited to just picking up footsteps - no amount of arm waving or hand flapping will be picked up. sensitivity to footwork is adjustable.the musini has five major settings (on a twist dial in the center of the unit) for types of music: ""bach"", ""child's play"", ""latin jazz"", ""carnival!"", and ""orchestral overture"". within each type it is possible to isolate particular instruments in the polyphonic sound by pressing four colored buttons on the unit. this provides quite a bit of variety. neurosmith promises additional sound cartridges that can be plugged into a connector on the side of the unit, too.the sound of the musini is very good, driven through two stereo speakers. sound is adjustable in two spots. in the battery case is a parental control that can select a high and low range for volume. this can then be tweaked from a volume control on the top of the unit. we found the low range to be nearly inaudible. the unit does conveniently include a headphone jack that might function better with this lower range of volume. otherwise, on high the unit sounds nice. (one caveat with our unit: the higher the sensitivity setting for footwork, the more prone the speakers were to static - an annoying problem.)the unit takes four ""c"" size batteries. we would recommend using rechargeables as this device does not cycle power like some of neurosmith's other toys. kudos to the designers for including a connector for a (not included) ac power adapter.working, the musini does get people moving. it plays patterns of synthesized music based on speed and styles of footwork. the unit will increase or decrease tempo and it is possible to get it to play single notes drawn out over time. the tempo sensing lags a bit, perhaps by about five seconds, but it is still fun to get it to speed up and slow down.the musini isn't perfect, though. those hoping that it functions like a children's theramin will be disappointed. one day an advanced version of the musini will use some kind of infrared sensors to provide input via other kinds of motion, not simply picking up stomping feet. and i wonder how long the toy will remain novel for most kids - it's tough to predict, and at its price it's a potential parental heartbreaker and walletbreaker.overall, i give it about three and a half stars.",good well durable stylish new hit exception go overboard dance music track surface device ads believe truly sophisticated movement limited amount arm hand sensitivity footwork five major twist dial center unit music play jazz carnival overture within type possible isolate particular sound colored unit bit variety additional sound connector side unit sound good two stereo sound adjustable two battery parental control select high low range volume volume control top unit low range inaudible unit conveniently include function better lower range volume high unit nice caveat unit higher sensitivity setting footwork prone static annoying unit size recommend using device cycle power kudos including connector power get people moving music speed footwork unit increase decrease tempo possible get play single notes time tempo bit five still fun get speed slow perfect disappointed day advanced version use kind infrared provide input via motion simply wonder long toy remain novel tough predict price potential parental heartbreaker give three half,,,,

Positive,Positive,this is a toy that was bought for the grandkids to play with at our house. i think it should be a bit more sensitive but they don't seem to mind. if the music doesn't play they just stomp their feet when they dance and then it does. and they think stomping is fun. however they do tire of it after 20 minutes or so. it doesn't play on the carpet at all but does o.k. on the kitchen floor. i have to say though i got it at the sale price and with the clarity of the music it was worth the money and i don't regret buying it at all. besides its something all of the kids can do at the same time so i consider that a good deal. if this one quit working i would buy another one because while they're playing with it they're having a ball. the really nice thing about it is all you have to do to activate it is dance--even the babies can do that and it doesn't take them long to get the idea. a good deal.,toy play house think bit sensitive mind music play stomp dance think fun tire play carpet ok kitchen floor say price clarity music worth money regret buying time consider good deal quit buy ball really nice activate long get idea good deal,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we gave this to our daughter as a christmas gift when she was 12.5 months old.  she was a bit young at that point to enjoy it very much, but she definitely has grown into it!  i'd say at about 18 months she really started to take a lot of interest in the train.  now at 21 months she loves to sit on the family room floor and remove the blocks and replace them on different pegs.all of the blocks fit on all of the pegs--sometimes more neatly than others.  there is no way a child can put the blocks on the pegs that will prevent the wheels from turning, so your little engineer won't experience that frustration!!  we have berber carpet in our family room and this train scoots along easily on the carpet as well as on the wood floor in the kitchen.although my child can replace all of the blocks (in a different order than originally intended!) she cannot reconnect the train cars yet, so she often uses them as three seperate choo-choo trains.  the nice thing about the pegs used to connect the cars though, is that they are the same size as the pegs the blocks are ""supposed to"" go on--so she often sticks blocks on those pegs too.we are thrilled with this purchase and i have already given it as a birthday gift to two other one year olds!  i love toys that children can grow into!",daughter christmas gift old bit young point enjoy much definitely say really lot interest train family room floor remove replace different fit neatly others way child put prevent little engineer experience frustration carpet family room train easily carpet well wood floor child replace different order intended reconnect train often three seperate nice connect size go often purchase already birthday gift two year love children grow,,,,

Positive,Positive,"at first, i wondered if the stacking train was ever going to entertain my son.  you see the cars slide off the linking dowels, if pushed down too hard.  well, at least when traveling on carpet, which is the main playing surface in our home.  what's more, the order in which the blocks stack onto the cars is essential for movement.  the blocks don't have to stack in perfect order, but certain blocks must be stacked in the appropriate places, otherwise the wheels cannot rotate.  my husband and i noticed how aggravated will became when he first started playing with the stacking train; thus, we intervened as the toy frustrated him so.  once he became familiar with the puzzle, (2 weeks later) he began to enjoy playing with it.  the stacking train soon became a favorite, and now, 7-months later, it still amuses him for 30 minutes or more a day.i have found that sometimes the age recommendation on toys is not always accurate.  this plaything is appropriately labeled for 2 and up, and will probably continue to entertain my son for another 6 months or more.  as a side note, the stacking order is quite complex for little minds.  although this does not take away from the fun-factor, it can add to the level of frustration.  this mommy had to go on-line to see the stacking sequence so she could teach her son.the stacking train is a well-built puzzle!  it has been tossed around, stepped on, and even chewed upon, yet keeps on rolling.  there are no sharp edges on this toy, but we have had a few minor mishaps when my son, who plays rough, has pulled the dowels off the cars.  we glued them back with wood glue, and the following day this choo choo is back to rolling around on the floor.  recently, my son lost one of the blue dowels, which links the cars together.  i called the customer service number, found on the bottom of the toy, and the company replaced the entire train for nothing.  now that's excellent customer service!  overall, i recommend the stacking train as it's engaged my son for hours on end, plus the educational values are significant.other points of interest: no batteries required there are no safety concerns with this plaything, i.e. strangling, smothering, cutting, or swallowing gender neutral plaything no assembly lifetime guaranteehappy playing,mary",first train going entertain see slide hard well least carpet main surface home order stack onto essential movement stack perfect order certain stacked appropriate rotate husband aggravated first train toy frustrated familiar puzzle enjoy train soon favorite still age recommendation accurate plaything appropriately probably continue entertain side note order little away add level frustration mommy go online see sequence teach train puzzle around upon rolling sharp toy minor rough glued back wood glue following day back rolling around floor recently lost blue together customer service number bottom toy company entire train nothing excellent customer service overall recommend train engaged hours plus educational interest safety plaything smothering gender neutral plaything assembly lifetime,,,,

Positive,Positive,"are you tired of the usual stacking rings that fail to challenge your child to think - if so, the melissa & doug stacking train may appeal to both you and your child.  the bright colors are visually appealing and will grab a child's attention.  the designs the stacked blocks create are interesting; they may also help you remember how the blocks are to be stacked.  this is important because the train's cars/engine will not take the proper form if the blocks are stacked incorrectly.  and believe me after the first few attempts, you will begin to question your own ability in attempting to correctly stack these.the colorful blocks are reasonably well finished.  the paint seems to be evenly applied; the interiors of the holes are a bit rough, but a light sanding with very fine-grit sandpaper takes care of that issue.  the posts on the engine and cars are short enough that i do not foresee their snapping off as did the posts on the geometric stacker which we also gave to our grandson.  however, they might still break if the pieces were dropped on a hard surface or thrown down.because there has been some concern over possible levels of barium contamination in melissa & doug products, we have chosen to reserve this toy as one that requires an adult playmate.  i have awarded the stacking train five stars because it is more challenging and more interesting than the usual stacking toy.  if it does not challenge your little one, it may still challenge you!",tired usual fail challenge child think doug train appeal child bright visually appealing grab attention stacked create interesting help remember stacked important proper form stacked incorrectly believe first begin question ability correctly stack colorful reasonably well finished paint bit rough light sandpaper engine short enough foresee geometric grandson still break hard surface concern possible contamination doug reserve toy adult train five interesting usual toy challenge little still challenge,,,,

Positive,Positive,"zingo is bingo and ""snap"" together in one. each player is given a card with 9 pictures on it. a dealer slides a mechanism and two tiles pop out of a plastic box. the first individual to match the tiles to their card claims the appropriate tile. play continues until someone covers the entire card or creates a previous agreed upon pattern (four corners, three in a row, etc.)durability: the tiles are a hard plastic, the dealing mechanism is also a hard plastic with no tiny mechanical parts. i expect these to last a long time. the cards are roughly 5x7 and are a thick cardboard, so as long as they are not exposed to liquid, should be fine for years to come. the only thing is that the tiles need a little bit of a strong push to be placed back in their holder. this could be an issue for younger kids; however i don't expect any breakage due to the extra force that is needed.level: this is for young kids. our oldest of four kids is 6, and he loves to play this game. however, his younger brother, who is only 2 1/2, caught on quickly to the concept and was able to start matching tiles to his card within 2-3 rounds of the game.time: the games can be completely fairly quickly. we finished games anywhere between 5 and 10 minutes. this is good with the young kids because they like clearing their cards and starting over.educational: this game can help with matching, recognition, memory and, eventually, word recognition (each picture, whether it is on the card or the tile, also has a word underneath it.)price: best price was on amazon that i could find.overall: a fun, family-friendly game for young players. wouldn't recommend for anyone older than 10 (and that is pushing it a little bit). box and pieces are sturdy. if taken care of it, it will last a long time.",bingo snap together player card dealer mechanism two pop plastic box first individual match card appropriate play continues entire card agreed upon pattern three row hard plastic mechanism hard plastic tiny mechanical expect last long time roughly thick cardboard long liquid fine need little bit strong push back holder younger expect breakage due extra force young oldest play game younger brother quickly able start card within games completely fairly quickly finished games good young clearing game help recognition memory word recognition picture card word underneath best price amazon fun game young recommend older pushing little bit box sturdy last long time,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my five-year-old and three-year-old love this game! it's like bingo, but with pictures/words. you slide the &#34;dealer&#34; forward and back to reveal two tiles at a time. each tile has a picture and a corresponding word. each player has a card with various pictures/words corresponding to the tiles. if you have that picture/word on your card, you say the word out loud, and then put the tile on your card. the winner is the player who fills their card first. each card has a red side and a green side. the red side is for older players, and the green side is for younger players. it appears that the red side utilizes only a subset of the total available tiles, making it a bit more difficult to fill your card (i.e., all of the potential tiles are represented on the green cards, but only some are represented on the red cards). when a player fills his card, he yells &#34;zingo!&#34;",love game bingo slide forward back reveal two time picture word player card various card say word loud put card winner player card first card red side green side red side older green side younger red side subset total available bit difficult fill card potential green red player card,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my kids loved this bingo game, particularly my younger son.  it is mostly a game of luck, but also reflexes, because the first person to call out that they have the picture on the chip on their card, gets to keep the chip.we used to take this to a nursing home to play with the seniors.  it is perfect for that situation (a 4 year old and a couple of seniors), because it is a simple, familiar game, and the graphics are simple and easy for everyone to identify.and, for my son, half the fun of this game was setting it up (stacking the chips in the dispenser) and sliding the dispenser forward and back to reveal the chips.highly recommended for the preschool/early elementary set.  my son is 6 now, and he still pulls this out sometimes, but he has a hard time convincing his 11 and 9 year old siblings to play.an option for older children, which has the same type of dispenser (and the dispenser is what makes this game) is ""smart mouth"", which dispenses two letters and players have to shout out a word that begins with the first letter and ends with the second.",loved bingo game younger mostly game luck first person call picture chip card keep nursing home play perfect situation year old couple simple familiar game simple easy everyone half fun game setting chips forward back reveal recommended elementary set still hard time convincing year old option older children type game smart mouth two shout word first letter second,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we received this for a gift for my then 3 year old. it was so much fun. my kindergartener loved it and so did my friend's 18 month old. the kids pick a card and match the letter, color, shape with one of the doors. when they find a match, they use a key to open the door to see if they can find a ball. if they find the ball, they put it in a special hole. when enough balls fill that hole, a treasure chest opens. it looks made to have a non-competitive feel, with all kids working together to open the chest. however, competitive kids will find a way to compete, and my daughter decided the way to win was to be the first to open the chest. younger kids like the 18 month old don't pay attention to the cards, they just poke around looking for the ball, but i could tell even she had the right idea.pros:+educational, teaches letters, numbers and colors+can be played by one player or multiple players+two difficulty levels to provide appropriate challengecons:-don't lose the balls or you won't be able to open the treasure chest-cards on doors can fall off easilysummaryexcellent preschool game for toddlers through kindergarteners. learn through play!",received gift year old much fun kindergartener loved month old pick card match letter color shape find match use key open see find ball find ball put special hole enough fill hole treasure chest feel together open chest competitive find way compete daughter decided way win first open chest younger month old pay attention poke around looking ball tell right player multiple difficulty provide appropriate lose able open treasure fall preschool game learn play,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this is a review of the children's game, cariboo, by cranium.  it requires no batteries, which is great.  it has two sets of cards for either beginner or advanced levels of playing, which is also nice.  it's ideal for preschool-age children.  the skills required include simple counting, matching colors/shapes/letters - even in the 'advanced' level.  however, the fun is in hoping to find a treasure ball under one of the doors, so older children often enjoy playing this with a younger child.  i wouldn't buy this game for anyone beyond kindergarten-level, although, as an adult, i haven't gotten tired of playing it yet.  =o)  one game takes only 5-10 minutes to play, which goes by fast.  (much speedier than candyland!)when you remove the lid of the box, you find the bottom part of the box - the game itself -  already assembled.  =o)  there are three holes along the top of the game board to drop six bright rubber balls.  they roll around and randomly settle under different doors, in shallow pockets.  it helps to jiggle the game slightly, to make sure each ball found its own pocket to settle in.  you need to play this game on a hard, level surface, because otherwise the balls can be easily jarred from their pockets.  even then, sometimes a ball won't settle into a pocket, and when you open the door you see two balls crowded there.  we just consider that a special bonus.if you want to play the beginner level, you're ready to play now.  the youngest player goes first.  she draws a card from the beginner deck, and it will either be a letter (a,b, or c), a number (1,2,3, or 4), a color (blue, yellow, red, or green), or a shape (circle, square, or triangle).  no reading is required for either level of this game.in each door, a card-insert shows a picture.  (you would have to flip over the card-inserts  to play the advanced level.)  for the beginning level, the card-inserts each show a picture like three red round cupcakes, or one green square alligator.  if you drew a c card from the beginner deck of cards, you can choose any door that has a c---- picture.  the pictures are all clearly labeled, so nonreaders just match the beginning letters which are bold and capitalized.the player inserts the tip of the key into a little hole above the door, which makes the door pop open.  then you look down in there, to see if a treasure ball happened to settle underneath that door.  if so, the player pulls it out and drops it into the hole/chute along the right side of the game board, which leads to the treasure chest.

Positive,Positive,"this game is one of the best i have bought for my almost 3 yr old. she can sit and play it with a friend (with my supervision for turn taking) and they can figure out most of it by themselves! she even explained to grandma how to play. it is holding up to much abuse and use. the kids open doors with their ""key"" (which she loves to do) and are looking for balls. once they find all six and drop them into the collection hole the treasure chest opens. my daughter doesn't mind that it opens to the same purple jewel all the time. one time i did remove the purple jewel and put in a hersey kiss and she thought that was great too! but just finding the balls and matching the cards to the game board is plenty of fun in and of itself. i highly recommend this game for little kids. the nice thing is the cards turn over for a more advanced matching game. i forsee that by age 4-5 she will grow out of it, but with younger siblings still to come i think this game will get plenty of use.",game best old play friend supervision turn taking figure grandma play holding much abuse use open key looking find six drop collection hole treasure chest daughter mind purple jewel time time remove purple jewel put kiss thought great game board plenty fun highly recommend game little nice turn advanced game age grow younger still think game get plenty use,,,,

Positive,Positive,"first i'd like to point out that even if your child already knows his/her abcs etc., you then use the ""advanced"" level of the game, in which you flip the cards over and there is something different on the other side. on the back side of the abc/color cards are different pictures with a whole word written out in all lower case letters. this is great for repetition of reading skills and phonics. there is a different set of playing cards for the advanced version, all this is included when you buy the game.my only gripes are if you do have to flip the cards back and forth between beginner and advanced on the ""doors"", they are pretty thin and can get bent easily, so i can see how you could really wear this game out. we use the ""beginner"" cards when my 2 year old is playing with us, the ""advanced"" cards when it's just my 5 year old and i (daddy plays too, when he gets home from work).also, if you are not right above the board, there is the possibility of cheating by being able to see where some of the balls are. but that's not necessarily a bad lesson, either (learning to resist the temptation)!anyway, we just love this game and the very first day we had it, my 2yr, 5yr old and i played 5 games together, then my 5 yr old and i played 10 (count 'em, 10!!!!) games in a row during the little one's nap!! wow! she would have kept going but we were sitting on the floor and my back was hurting!!! :)",first point child already use advanced level game flip different side back side different whole word lower great repetition reading different set advanced version buy flip back forth beginner advanced pretty thin get easily see really wear game use beginner year old advanced year old daddy home right board possibility cheating able see necessarily bad lesson learning resist love game first day old games together old count games row little nap wow going floor back hurting,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i thought this was a rather cute and endearing spin on the classic ""kerplunk"" game.  (it definitely doesn't win any points for originality).  the game is well-made and nicely designed.  it does take a while to get all the leaf sticks through there, and once you get down to the last five or six, it's rather tedious to get them in properly.the bees are cute, and add an extra element to keeping them up or making them fall than plain marbles.the one thing we didn't really like was that the instructions state to turn the trunk of the tree for each player's turn, so if they get any bees, they fall into their well.  well, the thing is full of bees, and it's really difficult to turn the trunk, and that takes more time than anything.  we ignored that bit of instruction after a few turns, because it was just ridiculous.  it doesn't rotate easily enough to do that every turn.  also, the wells in the ""meadow"" base aren't big enough to hold more than a few bees.  what we ended up doing is just rotating the whole unit and keeping our bees in front of us on the table.so the wells are basically useless (half the time the bee comes shooting out over it anyway) and the instructions to rotate the tree trunk are clearly given by people who haven't even tried to play the game, but other than that, we found it to be a fun and enjoyable game to play for our family game night.  it's definitely great for smaller kids too, as it's not too difficult to play.  my seven-year-old son loved it.also, it does come in a nice, sturdy box, but once you've unpackaged everything, there's no way to organize it within the box.  you kind of just end up dumping it all back in.",thought cute endearing spin classic game definitely win originality game nicely get leaf get last five six tedious get cute add extra element keeping fall plain really state turn trunk tree turn get fall well well full really difficult turn trunk time bit instruction ridiculous rotate easily enough every turn meadow base big enough hold ended rotating whole unit keeping front basically useless half time bee anyway rotate tree trunk clearly people tried play game fun enjoyable game play family game night definitely great smaller difficult play loved nice sturdy box everything way organize within box kind back,,,,

Positive,Positive,"james was the first battery powered thomas train we bought for our 2 year old son.  he takes a single ""aa"" battery, which is installed by unscrewing a single screw on the bottom, and lifting the body of the train off.  when you push the button on the top, he comes to life, moving at a surprisingly fast clip, and his lantern glows brightly.  the great thing about the battery powered trains is that they are perfectly capable of being played with without power, and as long as the button is not pushed down (even without battery), the wheels roll freely.  if you have the button on, the wheels will lock up and grind when you try to free-wheel it.  just something to be aware of.all of the battery powered trains are built the same way, and they are all die cast metal instead of wood (with the exception of the tender car, if the train has one like james).  this adds considerable weight to the train, and if dropped (or worse, thrown), really can hurt.  so be aware if you have a temperamental engineer!the speed of the engine with a fresh battery may pose some problems when navigating particularly curvy or technical track layouts, but with guidance does just fine.another thing to be aware of is that if you use track other than the thomas track with the traction etched into it, these engines may have some difficulty going up steep hills.  we have a few pieces of track from other random sets (like brio), and sometimes the train won't make it up and over a hill depending on how big of a load they are carrying and how new a battery is in there.i have not experienced that they make my son ""lazy"" about pushing his other trains, as some other reviewers have noted, but of course, all children are different.  he really enjoys the hands on approach, and even when james or his other battery powered engines are going on their own, he gently keeps a finger or two on them constantly!overall these are really fun additions to the set.",first battery train year old single battery single screw bottom body train push button top life moving surprisingly fast clip lantern brightly great battery perfectly capable without power long button without battery roll freely button lock grind try freewheel aware battery way cast metal wood exception tender car train considerable weight train worse really hurt aware temperamental speed engine fresh battery pose curvy technical track guidance aware use track track difficulty going steep track random brio train make hill big load new battery experienced make lazy pushing course children different really approach battery going gently finger two really fun set,,,,

Positive,Positive,"pros:- very powerful, can pull a long chain of trains on a wooden track (or take it off-track to watch it pull a train across the house on smooth floors)- moves relatively slow, but not too slow (slow enough that it's not racing around the track and derailing, but not so slow that it's sluggish)- runs on a single aa battery- grippy rubber-lined wheels- 4-wheel pulling (the two front and two rear)- center wheels lift up and out of the way around tight turns- strong die-cast metal housing lasts long with rough play (kind of like a matchbox car)- heavy weight helps give it good traction to pull trains- gears disengage when not turned on (so kids can push it along the track without breaking the gears)cons:- stupid battery-draining incandescent light that's too weak to see, but drains the battery quickly (i cut mine off; see below)- no auto-shut-off (on the model i have), so the battery dies quickly after a child lets it run into an object and never turns it off- no visible indication for when it's turned on other than a slightly depressed power button (the black patch on top of the train)- motor brushes wear out sooner than i'd expect (see below)i bought this train here on amazon on march 1, 2010 (~19 months ago) for my 2.5-year-old kids.  they loved it and have played with it often.  it has survived many droppings, slobber, being left running against a wall, tossed in toy boxes, etc.  the train is unbelievably strong -- i've had it pull about 10 other cars around a track and up ramps with no hesitation.  it's heavy and has grippy rubber-lined wheels, so it doesn't slip.  my kids play with this train both on and off the track; sometimes they just put a long train to run across the whole house on the floor.  my kids have played with this often and it has caused me to stock up on aa batteries.the things i don't like is that it has a stupid lamp in the front that isn't even noticeable, but drawn a lot of battery power (kind of like running a small flashlight in addition to the motor).  battery life increased substantially after i made a small incision above the front-right wheel to cut the red power wire for the light (used a dremmel with a cut-off wheel to carefully cut through the housing and snip the wire).another thing is that it doesn't have an automatic off feature (or at least the version i have doesn't).  so, often a brand new battery would go dead in a day because one of the kids left the train running after it smashed into a wall or other obstacle.  the product description now indicates that it has an auto-off -- i hope that's the case.the train's motor and gearbox is sealed using two triangular head screws, making it very difficult to open (if you want to try to make repairs).  i got past this by using the dremmel cut-off wheel to notch a flat head into the screws.  i did this recently because after 19 months of abuse, the engine seems to be running sluggishly and batteries don't last.  i figured the motor needed a little tune-up, so i disassembled it.  i found that the brushes on the motor had worn out pretty badly and could not be feasibly replaced.  i helped it a little, but it still runs like it's ""tired"".so, i've just added a replacement train to my shopping cart!  yup -- this train was so worth the money that i'm getting a replacement for the old worn-out one my kids love.update on 10/10/2011:the train does not have an automatic shut-off feature, as the product description claims it does (see the description from the manufacturer).the new train i ordered is running great (after i cut-off the battery-draining lamp); the train it replaces really was worn down from too much play.  =-)",powerful pull long chain wooden track watch pull train house smooth relatively slow slow slow enough around track slow sluggish single battery two front two rear center lift way around tight strong diecast metal long rough play kind matchbox car heavy weight give good pull disengage push track without stupid incandescent light weak see battery quickly cut see model battery quickly child run visible indication slightly depressed power button black patch top train motor wear expect see train amazon ago loved often many droppings slobber left running wall toy train unbelievably strong pull around track hesitation heavy slip play train track put long train run whole house floor often stock stupid lamp front noticeable lot battery power kind running small flashlight addition motor battery life increased substantially small incision wheel cut red power wire light cutoff wheel carefully cut snip automatic feature least version often brand new battery go dead day left train running smashed wall obstacle product description hope motor sealed using two triangular head difficult open try make past using cutoff wheel notch flat head recently abuse engine running last motor little motor pretty badly feasibly little still replacement train shopping yup train worth money replacement old train automatic shutoff feature product description see description new train running great cutoff lamp train really much play,,,,

Positive,Positive,"battery-powered thomas was purchased after we had such a good experience with battery-powered james, and seeing how much my 2 year old enjoyed this added dimension to his train play.thomas is powered by a single ""aa"" battery, which is installed by unscrewing a single screw on the bottom, and lifting the body of the train off.  when you push the button on the top, he comes to life, moving at a surprisingly fast clip, and his lantern glows brightly.  the great thing about the battery powered trains is that they are perfectly capable of being played with without power, and as long as the button is not pushed down (even without battery), the wheels roll freely.  if you have the button on, the wheels will lock up and grind when you try to free-wheel it.  just something to be aware of.all of the battery powered trains are built the same way, and they are all die cast metal instead of wood (with the exception of the tender car, if the train has one like james).  this adds considerable weight to the train, and if dropped (or worse, thrown), really can hurt.  so be aware if you have a temperamental engineer!the speed of the engine with a fresh battery may pose some problems when navigating particularly curvy or technical track layouts, but with guidance does just fine.another thing to be aware of is that if you use track other than the thomas track with the traction etched into it, these engines may have some difficulty going up steep hills.  we have a few pieces of track from other random sets (like brio), and sometimes the train won't make it up and over a hill depending on how big of a load they are carrying and how new a battery is in there.i have not experienced that they make my son ""lazy"" about pushing his other trains, as some other reviewers have noted, but of course, all children are different.  he really enjoys the hands on approach, and even when james or his other battery powered engines are going on their own, he gently keeps a finger or two on them constantly!overall these are really fun additions to the set.",good experience seeing much year old dimension train single battery single screw bottom body train push button top life moving surprisingly fast clip lantern brightly great battery perfectly capable without power long button without battery roll freely button lock grind try freewheel aware battery way cast metal wood exception tender car train considerable weight train worse really hurt aware temperamental speed engine fresh battery pose curvy technical track guidance aware use track track difficulty going steep track random brio train make hill big load new battery experienced make lazy pushing course children different really approach battery going gently finger two really fun set,,,,

Positive,Positive,"if you have a child that is a thomas fan, this battery-operated thomas is sure to please them.  this is one of my son's most-often played toys, among all of his (many) thomas trains.  it was one of the first trains he was able to use, because it didn't require him to understand how pushing down on a track with a train can make it come apart.  he could turn on thomas, let thomas do the navigating, and add cargo cars to for thomas to pull.despite the fact that he is a little older, tracks are more elaborate, and he is capable of pushing long car trains around the track himself, battery-operated thomas still gets lots of play.  thomas and his cars go one way, while my son pushes a train another way, and eventually they meet (and sometimes collide!)the fun factor is definitely here on this toy, however we have owned this train for about a year, and it is worn out and we are in need of a replacement.  the rubber around the wheels has worn almost completely off in spots, making it impossible for thomas to navigate/travel the track.  this is disappointing to me, especially for the price you pay for one train.  we did get a lot of use out of this, but it seems disappointing that this would be rendered useless after a year.despite this, i have bought another one of these for my son's christmas presents.  he likes it too much not to.",child fan sure please many first able use require understand pushing track train make apart turn let add cargo fact little older elaborate capable pushing long car around track still play go way train way meet fun definitely toy train year need replacement rubber around completely impossible track disappointing price pay train get lot use disappointing useless christmas much,,,,

Positive,Positive,"in the last few months my three year old son has become a big thomas/wooden railway fan, so last week his grandma bought this for him.  it's fun to watch thomas go around the track that i've helped him make, and this instantly became his favorite train.  yes, it does get derailed occasionally, and sometimes it stops running (at which point you have to press it down and give it a solid push for it to go again), but overall i'm pretty pleased with it.  i would like to caution everyone on its battery consumption - we have gone through about one a day.  as far as i'm concerned, that's the only major drawback.review update -the first one stopped working in exactly one week.  the replacement stopped working in the same way after 4 days.  amazon is having me send it back for a refund.  we bought the battery powered percy before the second thomas stopped working, and the percy is fine after more than one week.  and, it only went through one battery in that week.  so, i would definitely not recommend the thomas, but the percy might be fine.",last three year old become big railway fan last week grandma fun watch go around track make instantly favorite train yes get occasionally running point press give solid push go overall pretty pleased caution everyone battery consumption day far concerned major update first exactly week replacement way amazon send back refund battery second fine week battery week definitely recommend fine,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my wife and mother in law were standing around trying to figure out what maddie might want for a holiday gift, and maddie was playing with the leapfrog table, ignoring everything else on display. when they tried to get her to leave, with one of her own, she wouldn't let go of the one in the store. it's got the place of honor in the living room, and so far hasn't lost it's appeal.as with all musical toys, the big thing is how much does the child like the sounds it makes. our child loves the sounds this one makes. there is a large variety of possible sounds, and some are more or less favorite. the banjo and the piano sounds will get her dancing, so those are clearly good. i hear the drum sounds a lot too. a big thing from a parent point of view is that there is a way to turn the volume on this toy down, and it's loud enough for her to hear while the child plays with it, but no so loud that the banjo tune burns itself into the parent's memory forever. it has a lot of different controls that all move differenly, which encourages some exploration, which is good from a learnign perspective, but it's not terribly challenging, except for the switching modes by turning the page. i'm inclined to think that concept is way over our 13 month old's head, but then i notice that while she plays with the page, it never ends up on the ""letters and numbers mode"", and i know she likes the music mode better. so maybe she does understand it.the dog doesn't seem inclined to chew on it, so my usual yardstick for durability doesn't apply, here. it seems sturdy enough, but the door for the secret compartment seems a little flimsy.",wife mother law standing around trying figure holiday gift table everything else display tried get leave let go store place honor living room far lost musical big much child child large variety possible less favorite piano get dancing clearly good hear lot big parent point view way turn volume toy loud enough hear child loud tune memory forever lot different move exploration good perspective terribly except switching page think way month head notice page mode know music mode better maybe understand chew usual yardstick durability apply sturdy enough secret compartment little flimsy,,,,

Positive,Positive,"the leapstart learning table by leapfrog has not only been a source of smiles and distraction for our 9-month old (who has been playing with it for a couple of months now). it has been a truly educational toy for him. the table has detachable legs, so your baby can begin using it as soon as s/he can hold the head up and sit still. it has a &quot;page turner&quot; in the middle which swicthes all the buttons, keys and devices from a 'song mode' to an 'instrument mode'. when in song mode, all the devices sing back to the baby: some of them &quot;a-b-c&quot;, others &quot;1-2-3-4-5...&quot;, and a few others sing opposites such as &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;. when in instrument mode, pressing the buttons and keys and turning the wheels will make sounds of musical instruments come out of the learning table.today, months after starting to use it, i see santiago flip pages in a book with ease, and his love for music increased. i can only say: leapstart and diapers are two things that you cannot leave home without. and that's to remind you: it doesn't weight too much, so it's highly portable! forget about the copycats that followed suit. this is the original and it's worth every penny.",learning table source distraction old couple truly educational toy table detachable baby begin using soon hold head still middle song mode instrument mode song mode sing back baby others others sing instrument mode make musical learning use see flip book ease love music increased say two leave home without remind weight much highly portable forget suit original worth every penny,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this table is great because it has 2 sound settings and 2 learning settings.the table has nice chunky legs so it will not tip over.  if you have a little explorer like i do you may want to find a table with smaller legs.  my little one keeps getting stuck under the table.  he likes to crawl under things.  he is only 20 lbs and is my peanut.the table has many activities.  my boys favorites are the sliding trombone and the spinning wheel.  there is also a little lever toy, a key board, push button and door.  in the middle is a hard plastic book where they can decided between the two settings of learning.  the first page is learning with counting and the alphabet the second page is music.  my boys prefer the second page.  i do not know if it has to do with the page colors.  the music page is soft reds and oranges.  the learning page is cool whites, blues and greens.my only concern about the table is the little purple door.  my boys keep taking the door off.  i find them walking around with their prize.  it is not small enough to fit in their mouths but still presents concerns.great table for the money.",table great sound learning table nice tip little explorer find table smaller little stuck table crawl table many boys wheel little lever toy key board push button middle hard plastic book decided two learning first page learning counting alphabet second page music boys prefer second page know page music page soft learning page cool blues concern table little purple boys keep taking find around prize small enough fit still table money,,,,

Positive,Positive,"based on the reviews here i felt this activity table would be too overstimulating for my often times sensitive (almost) 11 month old.  however then we saw the table in the store and he loved it.  we purchased it for him for his birthday, but let him play with it for a day to make sure he'd like it enough to warrent the price tag.  he couldn't get enough of it!within minutes he'd learned to slide the trombone, push the lever for the cello and flip the lever for the bango.  the little door that says ""hello"" and ""bye-bye"" fasinates him as well as the spinner with the beads.  he has never really danced to music before, but after playing with this table for one day, he is now dancing to the music this and his other toys make.  i think he noticed that the table was not in the mix of other toys the next morning and i'm sure he's wondering where it went.pros:unlike some other tables we tested, this one has some rubber grip on the feet to keep it from scooting on the carpet.  it does scoot a little on the hardwood, though.two volume settings, and the louder isn't too loud.can still be utilized if the table is turned off completely, unlike some other tables we looked at.  great to keep baby occupied and save mommy's sanity.wide variety of music.  i'm not sure exactly how many songs this plays, but i would guess at least 20.cons:the sound the trombone makes is really a muted trumpet.  baby isn't going to know this, but it bugs me.the hinge on the little door on the hidden compartment is flimsy and the door comes off easily.  maybe that's just on our table, though, because we got a display to save a little money.there are limited places for baby to put his hands that don't have ativities associated with them.  as such, my supported stander keeps flipping one thing but balancing himself on another activity, which overrides the first.  eventually he'll grow out of that ""challenge"" but it seems to frustrate him a bit now.overall this is a wonderful table and i'm glad i didn't make too hasty of a judgement of it before seeing it in the store.  it's well worth the money.  i think this will be a favorite for some time.",activity table often sensitive month old saw table store loved birthday let play day make sure enough price tag get enough learned slide push lever flip lever little hello well spinner really music table day dancing music make think table mix next morning sure tested rubber grip keep carpet little hardwood volume louder still table completely great keep baby save variety music sure exactly many guess least sound really trumpet baby going know hinge little hidden compartment flimsy easily maybe table display save little limited baby put activity first hell grow challenge frustrate bit wonderful table glad make hasty judgement seeing store well worth money think favorite time,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my 10 month old son loves this toy. he cruises all around it in order to play with all the sides. he loves flipping the book, which switches mode from music to learning. it teaches colors, numbers, abcs, different instrument sounds and songs.the legs are detachable so the child can play on the floor. although this would make the table slide quite easily. with the legs attached, it still could move on carpet but not enough to worry about the child falling. but on non carpeted floors, this slides very easily and could cause the child to fall if the child is not walking yet. you're going to have to rest it on heavy furniture to prevent sliding.overall this leapfrog table is awesome. my son always goes back to it even if he has so many other toys. he never gets tired of it!",month old toy around order play book mode music learning different instrument detachable child play floor make table slide easily still move carpet enough worry child falling easily cause child fall child going rest heavy furniture prevent table awesome back many tired,,,,

Positive,Positive,my daughter loves this toy. she stands up with it all the time and just plays. if i'm doing laundry and don't want her to crawl up my leg i put a few puffs in the little box area. (under the purple lid is empty space we use for puffs.) she plays and grabs a snack here and there. she normally plays for at least 30mins. before getting poor which is the longest she'll play with any of her toys. it's also just the right height for my 9months baby which makes it just that much better. we actually tried a few out at second had stores just to check height and most are a lot lower to the ground so she'd rather sit that stand with them and i was looking for something to help he stand by herself so this was all around perfect.,daughter toy time laundry crawl leg put little box purple lid empty space use snack least poor longest shell play right height baby much better actually tried second check height lot lower ground shed stand looking help stand around perfect,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my sister-in-law sent this to my 1 year old daughter as her christmas gift, and she loves it! she quickly learned how to spin the wheel to make the music play or play the abc song (her favorite song right now!). she also loves to open and close the purple flap repeatedly and is especially delighted when we hide something small in the pocket that she discovers when she opens the flap. she can spend quite a few minutes at a time dancing to the music, spinning the wheel, opening the flap, etc. and walks around the table to reach the different elements. my only mild complaint is that the purple flap keeps coming off. my daughter has learned that she only needs to pull at it a little and it will come off. i would have given this product 5 stars except for that little (but annoying) detail.",year old daughter christmas gift quickly learned spin wheel make music play play abc song favorite song right open close purple flap hide small pocket flap spend time dancing music wheel opening flap around table reach different mild complaint purple flap coming daughter learned pull little product except little annoying detail,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my son received this table when he was 8 months old, and still plays with it on an almost daily basis.  the legs are detachable, i guess so it can be placed on the floor for babies, but we never did that...  this table helped our son into a standing position, and encouraged him to &quot;cruise&quot;. the variety of music it provides is great, and hasn't even begun to get old yet (even for mom &amp; dad). now at almost 2, i've noticed that my son is starting to make his own music instead of just &quot;pressing buttons&quot; .  pressing the drums, the piano, then back to the drums... i'm sure this table will last for years to come, especially once he becomes more interested in his letters, numbers, and colors. i would definitely recommend this product for every child!",received table old still daily basis detachable guess floor table standing position encouraged variety music great get old mom dad make music piano back sure table last interested definitely recommend product every child,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we purchased both a fisher price laugh and learn table and a leapstart learning table.  the plan was to see which one our daughter (7 months at the time) liked best.  we would keep the one she liked best at home and send the other to grandma and grandpa's house.  here is how the two compare.1.  the fisher price table is shorter than the leapstart table and baby seems to be able to pull up on it at a younger age. baby can also sit at the fisher price table easier because it is lower.2.  both have stable legs and do not tip over when baby leans up against them or pushes on them. both have legs that can be removed for floor play when baby can not stand.  (we never used it this way because our daughter was early to stand.)3.  both have a learning mode with abc song and counting to 10 song and a musical mode.4.  in the musical mode the laugh and learn table plays tunes to familiar children's songs.  it has a traditional feel to the music.  the leapstart table has music based on the different instruments on the table such as a banjo tune, a sax sound, etc. and it has a jazzier feel to the music.5.  the laugh and learn table has a food theme and looks like a set table.  in the learning mode concepts such as color, shapes, texture, manners, shapes, open/shut, empty/full, peek-a-boo, and naming of common items such as apple, blueberries, banana, juice, etc.  the leapstart table has a musical theme with instruments such as a piano, maracas, sax, violin, and banjo.  in the learning mode concepts include colors, shapes, high, low, on, off, hello, goodbye, etc.6.  on the laugh and learn table the parent has to change the mode.  on the leapstart table the child can change the mode by turning the page on the book in the center of the table.7.  the laugh and learn table has a bowl in the center that spins and can hold favorite objects.  the leapstart table has a small purple door that can hold favorite objects in the indentation underneath the door.as a parent, i like the leapstart table more.  the music is parent friendly and even after repeated use, it does not annoy adults.  i also like the different musical instruments and musical sounds that are introduced.  that said, my daughter (now 9 months) likes the laugh and learn table better.  she likes putting objects like small balls, cheerios, and her pacifier in the bowl in the center.  she also likes the peek-a-boo napkin with the peas underneath which says ""peek-a-boo.  i see you."" when she opens the door.  it makes her laugh. another favorite is the spoon rattle that can be removed from the table and the alphabet letters that float in the water sealed in the bowl that move around when the bowl spins.  this is her favorite toy.  she does play with the leapstart table at her grandparents house now, but her attention span is short with this toy.  she can play with her laugh and learn table for long periods of time.",fisher price laugh learn table learning table plan see daughter time liked best keep liked best home send grandma house two fisher price table shorter table baby able pull younger age baby fisher price table easier stable tip baby removed floor play baby stand way daughter early learning mode abc song counting song musical musical mode laugh learn table familiar traditional feel music table music different table tune sax sound feel laugh learn table food set table learning mode color texture peekaboo naming common apple banana juice table musical piano sax violin learning mode include high low hello goodbye laugh learn table parent change mode table child change mode page book center laugh learn table bowl center hold favorite table small purple hold favorite indentation underneath parent table music parent friendly repeated use annoy different musical musical daughter laugh learn table better small pacifier bowl center peekaboo napkin underneath peekaboo see laugh favorite spoon rattle removed table alphabet float water sealed bowl move around bowl favorite toy play table house attention span short toy play laugh learn table long time,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my son got this when he was four months old.  at that age, he liked to watch us play it for him, but at five months he started playing with it himself.  the keys are easy for him to press and he really likes looking at himself in the mirror.there are three different learning modes (colors and shapes, songs, and free play). there are also four different instruments to choose from (banjo, flute, sax and piano).  each instrument plays several different songs which are selected by pressing the instrument buttons surrounding the mirror.  the mirror has four flashing red light bars around it that light up when the keys are pressed.the only complaint i have with this toy is the volume.  as with some other leap frog toys we own, the sound is too loud on the lowest setting. the speaker is on the upper left side and i find it easy to hold my palm over it to lower the volume when i am helping play with the toy, but i am considering putting some tape over the speaker for times that my palm is not available.",old age liked watch play five easy press really looking three different learning free play different choose flute sax piano instrument several different instrument surrounding mirror mirror red light around light complaint toy volume leap frog sound loud lowest setting speaker upper left side find easy hold palm lower volume play toy tape speaker palm available,,,,

Positive,Positive,"among the leap frog products, this learning piano is terrific.  we've had it in our home for the last two years, and it's just as much fun as it was when it first entered our home.there are basically four areas of interest on this piano.  there's the piano sound, banjo, woodwind sound, and saxophone sound.  then when you push each little circle with the picture of the instrument, you get a variety of different songs.  for example, the banjo sound plays the tune, among others, of ""oh susanna,"" and the piano sounds gives a really neat instrumental version of a ragtime piece.if for some reason you just push the button, the music will play for several seconds, and then the little voice will come on and say ""press any key to play the song,"" and then you can continue the music up to the end by continuing to hit the keys.  it looks as if you're really playing the piano, too.our girls have loved this, and its importance is in teaching not only the variety of music, but the different kinds of instruments, and the fun of interacting physically with the sounds, among other things.this product is really great!!  and highly recommended!!",leap frog learning piano terrific weve home last two much fun first basically interest piano piano sound woodwind sound saxophone sound push little circle picture instrument get variety different example sound tune others oh piano really neat instrumental version reason push button music play several little voice say press key play song continue music continuing hit really piano loved importance variety music different fun physically product really great highly recommended,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my son received this for christmas last year.  as i was going through other leapfrog items, i noticed that the imagnination desk didn't have 5 stars.  i am amazed!  the toy is great.  my child has high functioning autism and it was the best way for him to learn his alphabet.  in fact, he learned all of his letters and the sounds they make in only a few days.  the visual and musical combination while using a motor skill, i guess is what did it.  i have loaned out my son's desk to other special needs children and they have had similiar results.  i love that you can directly print new coloring pages from the internet.  we haven't had any type of mechanical problems and the page is always on the correct sensors.  any child who has been to my house has gravitated to this toy.  it is a winner and definitely worth the money.",received christmas last year going desk amazed toy great child high autism best way learn alphabet fact learned make visual musical combination using motor skill guess desk special children love directly print new internet type mechanical page correct child house toy winner definitely worth money,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i use this with my 2 year old(27 mo), and the level is about right, i think a child who knows their abcs etc would not appreciate it, but my son who was reluctant to use crayons loves to hear pooh bear or tigger talk to him.  so he spends 30-40 min at a time coloring which he would not do previously. the basic abc sheets are not very interesting, but we color a few of those and then move on to pooh bear each day and i guess some of the information sticks.for his age group, i have to play with him, but he is catching on to the go circle, and i am thrilled when he attempts to color within the lines, and matches specific colors with specific objects like yellow bananas... this is also a redesign.  it does not have snap on templates with numbers, or the coloring template like the previous design.  the blue lid which holds the coloring page in place does come off occasionally, but only if he tries to open and pry it off, not while coloring.  i don't notice any problems with sensitivity so far, but if you are not right in the middle of an object, it won't identify it for you.  not a problem so far since he seems just too young for the game mode where this might lead to frustration.for the future, i'm not sure if this toy will lead to independent play since you have to keep changing coloring sheets etc.  all of which can lead to numerous toddler decisions and frustrations.  despite the high price, this is a great great way to encourage coloring / writing skills though for your boy who would much rather be playing with trains or cars.",use year mo level right think child appreciate reluctant use hear bear talk time basic abc interesting color move bear day guess information age group play catching go circle color within specific specific yellow redesign snap template design blue lid page place occasionally open pry notice sensitivity far right middle identify problem far young game mode lead future sure toy lead independent play keep changing lead numerous toddler despite high price great great way encourage writing boy much,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this year for christmas my two and a half year old and my 10 month old daughter recieved this as a gift. it is one of the most played with toys so far that they recieved for christmas this year. they love it! it is absolutely adorable...although i do wish it had an off and on switch but it doesn't!this mailbox has cute butterfly that can be batted around on top of it, three brightly colored envelopes, spinning lady bug on the base of the toy, a worm that makes a zipping noise when moved side to side on the base as well, an opening in the back of the mailbox to retrieve or put letters inside the mailbox, a clicking flag, spin the bee around and hear it make buzzing noises, slide the letters in the front of the mailbox in the slot or in the slot on the side of the mailbox as well, stackable packages. my two year old loves to put the mail in the mailbox and take it back out and my 10 month old loves to play with the stackable packages and hear the bee making noises! this toy does topple. took for what seemed like forever to put it together especially since it was all visual instructions, but worth it though. it is not really heavy...my 2 year old will pick it up and carry it around and she is pretty rough with it and the mailbox post stays in even when she has thrown it around a couple of times. i do have to say that i wish the bee would say a few phrases to make it a little interactive, in my opinion that would have been a nice added feature but all in all no complaints here. my girls are happy with it and enjoy it and so am i. it is worth it for the price....by the way the plastic that this toy is made out of is pretty decent....nice and thick and durable. i am happy they get so much enjoyment out of this toy. also, this toy is going to make a nice addition to all of our pretend kitchen and cooking/house items as well....good for older children and toddlers to pretend play with house too.",year christmas two half year old month old daughter gift far christmas year love absolutely wish switch mailbox cute butterfly around top three brightly colored lady bug base toy worm noise side side base well opening back mailbox retrieve put inside mailbox flag spin bee around hear make buzzing slide front mailbox slot slot side mailbox well stackable two year old put mail mailbox back month old play stackable hear bee toy topple forever put together visual worth really year old pick carry around pretty rough mailbox post around couple say wish bee say make little interactive opinion nice feature happy enjoy worth way plastic toy pretty thick durable happy get much enjoyment toy toy going make nice addition pretend kitchen older children pretend play house,,,,

Positive,Positive,"although i've read the reviews and the manufacturer's description of the toy, actually having it in my hand: it's amazing.  on one page your child can hear the story read to them; touch any word and it is verbalized (""sing""); in phonic mode, touch the same word and it is sounded out (""s-ing""); touch the characters or pictures on the page and it would say who or what it is or imitate person/thing; spell words; the game will ask you to find similar items - you touch it and it would agree and count the item if correct; music!!! on one page!!! and each book has about 25 pages!!!  the pages are chuck filled with characters (people and things) so that it can take a while to go through if your child is really curious.5 stars for fun because of the myriad of activities and the fact that she doesn't have to hear mommy's voice reading to her all the time.5 stars for educational value because of what i described above.5 stars for durability because i bought this used and it's in excellent condition.  i believe you have to show children how something is to be used - open on table, or on lap if sitting on floor mat - and the likelihood of it being destroyed is reduced.  parents also need to know that the child would still need their attention to go through the book even though they can touch, because it makes the child feel encouraged/loved/special.  so give them the book, but spend time doing the activities too.people complained in their reviews that there aren't enough books - but each book does so much it can hold attention for a long while.  for example, the child may only want to hear the story and touch the pictures initially but as they grow the words and their sound/pronunciation and the spelling will become more important/relevant to them.  and actually, there are at least 6 beginner books that i've found - i've purchased 3 for now because i think it will hold my daughter's interest for a long while.(nb: i may not be so excited if i'd paid $99, but at $15-30 i'm ecstatic)",read description toy actually hand amazing page child hear story read touch word sing mode touch word sing touch page say imitate spell game ask find similar touch agree count correct music page book people go child really fun myriad fact hear voice reading educational value described durability excellent condition believe show children open table floor mat likelihood destroyed reduced need know child still need attention go book touch child feel give book spend time enough book much hold attention long example child hear story touch grow spelling become actually least beginner think hold interest long excited paid ecstatic,,,,

Positive,Positive,"first the description:  you open it up, slip in the book --simple enough for my son (3 yrs old) to do himself, even changing the cartridge --  and switch it on, you are set! this is an incredible improvement over leappad and my first leappad for a totally self directed learning experience.  he has never ended up frustrated while using this toy.about the add-ons, i currently have two and he enjoys the i spy even though he is not in the recommended age group.  he is able to follow along anything it requires.  the volume slide is so nice and easy vs having to hit + and - symbols with a pen on the leappads. the blues clues one is for his age group and he loves that too.now for more comparisons:i own both the leap pad, and the my first leap pad for my now 3 year old son.  i would pass on that and go for this toy. after more than 1 1/2 years of owning them, i still need to pull them out for him, and watch over and remind him to hit the go circle etc.  in fact, he probably prefers a paper book to them, given that with normal 2- 3 yr old boy handling, the pen's contacts are iffy, and the pads shut off at random etc after just a few months of use.  i have to say, he does truly enjoy the dora, thomas, jay-jay, bob the builder, bear in the big blue house etc.  theme books for the leap pad / my first leap pad also.and as for leap pad plus, lets just say that the same go circle, and delicate pen problems still exist for a rambunctious boy :-) i do like the imagination desk, which does get him coloring and sounding out letters and words quite a bit, especially with pooh bear, or clifford.  wish they had a familiar character themed alphabet book too for that as well as the leap pad.  if you look at the parent complaining about a stray wrist making other stuff on the page sound out with the power touch, imagine a stray pen touch resetting the entire page to some other go circle.  much easier to teach them to point. at least, here the sounds relate to the page under view always.  i pull out the leap pad occasionaly if i have a sore throat and can't get through the dozens of books he likes for night time reading.  my son pulls out and plays with the power touch by himself.  enough said with that...",first description open slip book simple enough old changing switch set incredible improvement first totally self learning experience ended frustrated using currently two spy recommended age group able follow volume slide nice easy hit pen blues age group leap pad first leap pad year old pass go toy still need pull watch remind hit go circle fact probably paper book normal old boy iffy shut random use say truly enjoy builder bear big blue house leap pad first leap pad leap pad plus say go circle delicate pen still exist rambunctious boy imagination desk get sounding bit bear wish familiar character alphabet book well leap pad look parent complaining stray wrist stuff page sound power touch imagine stray pen touch entire page go circle much easier teach point least relate page view pull leap pad sore throat get night time reading power touch enough,,,,

Positive,Positive,"like other parents, we have struggled between the powertouch and the leappad systems from leapfrog. after having owned a few of them now, this one is easily our favorite.pros:1. powertouch only requires that you buy one system. leappad has 3 different systems for the different ages of your child, so every few years you need to buy a new system to access the books for older children. powertouch has books ranging from ages 3 and up so you will only ever need one system.2. bigger books. leappad book pages are about half the size of powertouch books, and leappad books have a border around each page that significantly cuts down the active play area. if you've used the leappads before, you'll immediately appreciate powertouch's big, brightly colored pages.3. more activities. from our experience with the littletouch leappad and my first leappad, powertouch has tons more activities on every single page.4. no stylus. although my 2-year-old uses the stylus just fine (lots of practice from his magna doodle!) it is just easier and more natural for a toddler to use their fingers. not to mention the leappad stylus can actually leave black marks all over your books!5. volume control. the volume on the powertouch system is controlled by using a slider on the actual system, like most toys. the leappads require you to tap the + and - icons on the actual book pages and it gets really tedious really quickly and the taps don't always register.6. master on/off switch. powertouch has a switch on the back that you can turn off to prevent the system from accidentally turning on when bumped. leappads do not!7. books are easier to insert. powertouch books just slide right onto the system. the my first leappad especially is annoying for my toddler because you have to align the tabs on the system just right with the spirals of the book and he can't ever seem to get it on straight by himself.8. no ""go"" button! the ""go"" button on the littletouch leappad is silly. for the ages it's targetted at, those children probably won't understand the concept of touching ""go"" when they want to play on a new page. my son received a my first leappad at about 18 months old and picked up on the idea of the ""go"" button fairly quickly, but before he learned how to do it himself he would very frequently get frustrated because i'd have to stop him and use the stylus to push ""go"" for him. powertouch has sensors along the top edge that reads the page without having to push any buttons to advance the pages.9. durability. after only a few months with our my first leappad, it is behaving erratically. sometimes it reads the movements of the stylus, sometimes not. we don't really know what causes this, it just started acting crazy one day. my son takes very good care of his toys and has never broken any of his toys. our powertouch was given to us by a friend that had been handed down between several children! it is still working like new for us.cons:1. the system is bigger than the two smaller leappads, but it has a carrying handle and you can purchase a backpack. the larger size also allows for larger books, which means more activities for your child so i don't really see this as much of a con.so there is my rundown. we love fisher price and leapfrog toys so i am not biased towards one or the other, this is just an honest comparison and powertouch clearly wins in every category. i wish i would have purchased the powertouch in the first place! it's fantastic and my son loves it!!",easily buy system different different child every need buy new system access older children need bigger book half size border around page significantly active play immediately appreciate big brightly colored experience first tons every single fine practice doodle easier natural toddler use mention actually leave black volume control volume system using slider actual system require tap actual book really tedious really quickly master switch switch back turn prevent system accidentally easier insert slide right onto system first annoying toddler align system right book get straight go button go button silly children probably understand go play new page received first old idea go button fairly quickly learned frequently get frustrated stop use push go top edge page without push advance durability first really know acting crazy day good broken friend several children still new system bigger two smaller handle purchase backpack larger size larger means child really see much rundown love fisher price honest comparison clearly every category wish first place fantastic,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this is an excellent toy that allows a child to learn with or without a parent helping out.  my son (3 yrs old) has four books for this unit and they all read and count accurately and our unit has never frozen up on us.  my favorite thing about this toy - no green go circle!  i'm sorry, but reminding my son to ""press the green go circle"" every time he turned a page on his leappad jr was seriously annoying.  the powertouch, on the other hand, knows what page you are on automatically.  also, there is no stylus to worry about, the child simply presses words and pictures with his/her finger.  this product is far superior to the leappads.another thing i like about this system is the multitude of activities.  there are multiple counting, phonics, and game activities on almost every page.  also, when the system does not have a book in it, there is an alphabet with activities built right into the system.the unit has an easy on/off switch in the front that is easy for kids and a master on/off reset switch in the back.  it is easy for kiddos to open and close and use without help, so mom can have a bit of a rest (thank you fisher price!!).",excellent toy child learn without parent old unit read count accurately unit frozen favorite toy green go circle sorry press green go circle every time page seriously annoying hand page automatically worry child simply finger product far superior system multitude multiple counting game every page system book alphabet right unit easy switch front easy master reset switch back easy open close use without help mom bit rest thank fisher price,,,,

Positive,Positive,"so my 17-month old is always underfoot in the kitchen, and keeps playing with the tupperware.  she's beginning to show the emergence of pretend play, so i thought that this would be a nice kitchen set that she could grown in to as she gets older.  boy, this set really does have everything ""except the sink""!  everything's packaged separately in the box it comes in, so nothing's loose and rattling around.  the bright primary colors immediately attracted my little one.  the set is marked ""ages 3+"" and i can see why -- there are small pieces, like the cookie cutters, and some of the saucers (for the teacups, i guess) are the size of chips ahoy cookies.  needless to say, i'll be storing those pieces away until she's older...and wants more pieces for her pretend play.  she especially likes the tea kettle and the saucepan -- i think the handles are the attraction -- they're just right for her little hands.  i also like that the set it easy to clean....i'm not sure if it's dishwasher safe, but i just hand wash them, it doesn't take a lot of time.  some of the cups survived a short drop from the kitchen table (she was playing before dinner was served) and no scratches or cracks on the toy or our hardwood floor.  i read other reviews that said this set is too expensive for what you get, and it's cheaply made, but i have to disagree.  the pots are a little on the small side to fit some of the play food she already has, but that's a minor thing -- we can adjust to that (and it'll be good for her problem-solving skills and spatial development).  i think it's a great buy, and even if it doesn't contain any play food, it helps her develop her imagination (and she's mimicking what i do in the kitchen), and keeps her busy where i can keep an eye on her as i cook.  i think it's a great buy!",old underfoot kitchen tupperware beginning show emergence pretend play thought nice kitchen set older boy set really everything except sink box loose rattling around bright primary immediately little set marked see small cookie guess size chips needless say away pretend play tea kettle saucepan think attraction right little set easy sure dishwasher safe hand wash lot time short drop kitchen table dinner toy hardwood floor read set expensive get cheaply disagree little small side fit play food already minor adjust good development think great buy contain play food develop imagination kitchen busy keep eye cook think great buy,,,,

Positive,Positive,"the math mat is kinda cool and my children (3.5 and 5.5 years of age) and i have been having fun playing with it since we got it for christmas.my daughter uses it to practice addition.  the math mat gives her an equation, such as `what is 2 + 8' on the ""easy"" level and she runs around and jumps on the usually correct number.  if you don't get the number correct, the mat tells you what the answer is.  and key to the math mat's success and popularity is that it always keeps a positive outlook.my 3.5 year old son on the other hand can't do equations so he plays at identifying the numbers.  the ""easy"" level on the mat is just that: identify the numbers from 0 to 10.  the more ""difficult"" level gives children a sequence of numbers for which they must give the missing number.  for example, the mat will say something like, `what number comes next"".  then it will say the sequence ""3, 4, _"" and your child has to come up with ""5"" for an answer.i foresee a slight lag problem where the mat might not get much use.  a toddler might have fun identifying their numbers, and a preschooler might have fun filling in the sequence, but there will probably be a gap in time before they progress to an age where they can do simple addition equations.  (then again, if they have the math mat maybe there won't be a gap.)four stars.  good educational fun.  toddlers and preschoolers will probably need parental help and motivation.the math mat takes 3 aa batteries.  to play you put the mat on the floor and then choose whether you want to do addition or subtraction or number identification.  it is all pretty intuitive and we haven't had to look at instructions.",math mat cool children age fun daughter practice addition math mat equation easy level around correct number get number correct mat answer key math success popularity positive year old hand easy level mat identify difficult level children sequence give missing number example mat say number next say sequence child foresee slight lag problem mat get much use toddler fun preschooler fun sequence probably gap time progress age simple addition math mat maybe good educational fun probably need parental help math mat play put mat floor choose addition subtraction number identification pretty intuitive look,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this is a great toy!  my son loves the math mat so much that when i challenge him to a game he shouts out the answers to the problems and occasionally tries to step on the buttons even when it's my turn to play!  this is a great toy for letting the kids run off some of their energy as they review their basic math skills.  my 5-year-old son runs around the mat as the computer voice says the equation and then he quickly runs to step on the answer.  the mat has three games (number identification and sequence, addition, and subtraction) and two levels of play.  regarding addition and subtraction, the first level requires you to find the sum or the difference and the second level gives you the answer to the problem and the first number in the equation and you provide the missing number.  we use level 1 as a warm up since it provides a good review and then we play level 2 for a challenge.i'd give this toy more than 5 stars in the fun and educational categories if i could.  since most children are quite active and learn math at different rates and since repetition is good at this stage, most children would get a lot of good quality use out of this game.  i think the durability is pretty good also but it's really too soon to know.",great toy math mat much challenge game occasionally step turn play great toy run energy review basic math around mat computer voice equation quickly step answer mat three games number identification sequence addition subtraction two play addition subtraction first level find sum difference second level answer problem first number equation provide missing number use level warm good review play level give toy fun educational children active learn math different repetition good stage children get lot good quality use game think durability pretty good really soon know,,,,

Positive,Positive,"very young toddlers to preschool age kids have played with the latches board we bought for our son, and they've all loved it!if anyone is worried that this will ""teach"" their child to open locks, my response to that is, this toy is so easy for kids to play with that they figure it out right away. the ease of use of this toy just proves that a child can undo a latch very easily, without being ""taught"" how to do it. if you lock doors in your home with a latch, you're going to have to put the latch out of the child's reach anyway, because it will be very easy for them to open it if they can reach it.  does anyone honestly think their child needs practice in order to learn how to flip these little locks from one side to the other? no, kids are much smarter than that, they already know how to do it.",young preschool age board loved worried teach child open response toy easy play figure right away ease use toy child undo latch easily without lock home latch going put latch reach anyway easy open reach honestly think child practice order learn flip little side much smarter already know,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this ""latches"" board is great practice for problem-solving and manual dexterity/manipulation for toddlers/preschoolers.  i got this one mixed up with the ""locks"" board--much more complicated and for older children.  i caught the difference just before i purchased it, so i did end up with this one--the right one.  our 15-mo-old dtr. likes to fiddle with it for quite a while--she hasn't figured out all of the latches and needs a little help, but she also likes to look at the animals inside the doors.  our 3-yr-old likes to open/close the locks and doors, and it keeps his attention for several minutes (which is good considering his short attention span).  even our 5-yr-old will play with it a little, but i don't think it does much for him developmentally.  the only setback is that two of the latches are attached very tightly and so far, only the adults have been able to open those doors.  probably just a problem when it was made.  overall, a good developmental toy to have around the house.",board great practice manual mixed complicated older children difference right fiddle little help look animals inside attention several good short attention span play little think much setback two far able open probably problem overall good developmental toy around house,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my daughter and i fell in love with the little people sets after she recieved melody the minivan for her birthday. since she loves all things involving animals we got her this little play zoo. the pieces are adorable and just the right size for infants and toddlers. this set comes with animals which when put in their cages make the appropriate animal sounds. the bird sits on top and plays a song which delights my daughter. this toy is not loud or annoying at all. it doesn't just go off as a reviewer noted. my daughter isn't aware of how to activate the sounds yet, with the exception of the bird's song. there is a monkey on a vine which hops up the vine when the lever next to him is depressed and he emits a springy sound. he is the only part that could be improved on. you have to hit the lever hard to get him to the top and he just pops up and down. i feel they could have made him swing instead or move more slowly so it seems as though he is really climbing. the figures are made of a rubbery material (as in rubber ducks) and my daughter loves to carry them around. they have now become her favorite bath toy. she just turned one and doesn't prentend play with them yet but she loves putting the pieces in different places and putting some of the animals in the minivan and the train which we also got for her. the zoo train is a wonderful addition to this set. the zookeeper and his car are by far her favorite part of this set. she always tosses the fish basket out and puts one of the other figurines in with him. she isn't able to fit the pieces in properly yet but that doesn't stop her from giving them a ride. most of the pieces usually get tossed around and we had to search for the zookeeper once. he got lost under the couch. since the pieces are easily washable i don't mind them getting tossed everywhere. my daughter plays with this every day and will point at it when she wants to play with it. it's the only toy so far that she points out. i believe this toy will get much more use as my daughter continues to develop and use the toy in different ways. also by adding a different set or different animals it seems as though it's a whole new toy. i fell in love with these toys since they aren't just noisemakers. most electronic toys recite things we want our children to learn but don't foster their imaginations. this toy definitely engages curious young minds and helps them relate to things that we do and see every day. fisher price is definitely an expert at challenging young minds.",daughter love little people melody minivan birthday animals little play zoo adorable right size set animals put make appropriate animal bird top song daughter toy loud annoying go reviewer daughter aware activate exception song monkey vine vine lever next depressed springy sound part hit lever hard get top feel swing move slowly really rubbery material rubber daughter carry around become favorite bath toy play different animals minivan train zoo train wonderful addition set car far favorite part set fish basket able fit properly stop giving ride get around search lost couch easily washable mind everywhere daughter every day point play toy far believe toy get much use daughter continues develop use toy different different set different animals whole new toy love electronic recite children learn foster toy definitely curious young relate see every day fisher price definitely expert young,,,,

Positive,Positive,"after reading these reviews, i rushed right out and bought this set for my 17 mo. old, who has recently developed an interest in sports and physical activities.  as a 10 yr. veteran preschool teacher,  i have never seen a toddler get interested in bowling, and my son was no different.  of all the toys--soccer goal, basketball, t-ball, this was the only one that he won't go near. i understand why this activity may not appeal to toddlers.  it simply takes too much time to set up all 6 pins,  then walk a distance and roll the ball,  only to have to set up all 6 pins again...over and over and over.  it's difficult for them to coordinate setting the pins up in the first place without knocking the others over and all of this simply takes too long for their short attention spans.  i am hoping that he will grow into it.  i am really disappointed that my son is not interested in this set,  especially since it was more costly than other ones i've seen. yet, i can't totally rate the set based on my son's lack of interest - as the pins are very durable, the bowling ball is the perfect size for little hands, and the internal balls inside the pins are a neat/unique addition.  just be warned:  although this toy is marketed for toddlers and called ""tot sports bowling set,"" older kids in the 3+ range will probably have more fun with it. if you would like to ""experiment"" to see if your toddler will be interested in bowling,  i highly recommend purchasing a much cheaper set before spending this much money.  on the other hand,  if you come from a family of bowlers and want to buy a durable set a little early and plan on spending hours with your kiddo practicing,  i highly recommend this one. hope this helps!",reading right set mo old recently developed interest sports physical veteran preschool teacher toddler get interested bowling different goal basketball go near understand activity appeal simply much time set walk distance roll ball set difficult coordinate setting first place without others simply long short attention grow really disappointed interested set costly totally rate set lack interest durable bowling ball perfect size little internal inside addition toy sports bowling set older range probably fun experiment see toddler interested bowling highly recommend purchasing much cheaper set spending much money hand family buy durable set little early plan spending hours highly recommend hope,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this game is pretty fun - i'm surprised at all the negative reviews for it. the point of the game is to fill up your ""pie"" by getting a question right from each main category. the questions all pertain to the last twenty years. some of the questions are pretty difficult - really obsurd things. but for the most part, the questions are pretty reasonable. i don't know why the recommended age for this game is 13 and up though. i don't know any 13 year old that would be able to get a quarter of these questions. you definitley have to know your trivia. the literature always seems to be the hardest - at least with everyone that i've ever played with - because the questions range from authors personal lives to comic books to newspapers to romance novels and then some. you have to be pretty brushed up on your current events if you want to win this game, but i think it's still fun. anytime i've ever played it's been with a group of people and we've always had a blast.",game pretty fun surprised negative point game fill pie question right main category pertain last twenty pretty difficult really part pretty reasonable know recommended age game know year old able get quarter know trivia literature hardest least everyone range personal comic romance pretty brushed current win game think still fun group people weve blast,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my daughter enjoyed the ocean wonders aquarium in her crib so i decided to get the fish bowl for her to play with in her play yard. she was almost 6 months old and just starting to sit unassisted. the fishbowl was just the right size. it gave her something to hold onto and play with while sitting. after only a couple of days she was sitting for longer periods without falling over. first she was more interested in rocking the bowl and flipping it over to spill the balls out. at 7 months she started rolling the balls and we could pass them back and forth on the floor. i've made a game of trying to make the fish and the sea shell spin inside the flutter balls. i enjoy playing with this toy as much as the baby does. i like to spin the bowl around clockwise to shake the glitter up and make the fish swim by. when i first saw this toy i thought it was only good for was practicing hand-eye coordination by taking the balls out and putting them back in, but there's so much more to it. it lights up and plays cute little water sound effects and music, but even when it's turned off it's still pretty exciting (which is good since my daughter likes to flip it over and turn off the switch on the bottom.) imaginative minds can find many different ways to play with this toy so it's definitely one children can enjoy for years to come.",daughter ocean aquarium crib decided get fish bowl play play yard old fishbowl right size hold onto play couple longer without falling first interested bowl spill rolling pass back forth floor game trying make fish shell spin inside flutter enjoy toy much baby spin bowl around shake glitter make fish swim first saw toy thought good coordination taking back much cute little water sound music still pretty exciting good daughter flip turn switch bottom imaginative find many different play toy definitely children enjoy,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we bought this for our son when he was about 6 months old and he loved it from the start.  when he was younger he would bat or kick at it and make the music come on and he would watch the fish swim around.  as he got older he discovered the flutter balls.  he loves putting them in the bowl and then taking them out.  (this is great for fine motor skill development.)  he also discovered that if he shook the balls or rolled them across the floor that the object inside moved.  he is now almost 15 months old and this remains a favorite toy.  we had purchased another fish bowl toy (soft style) and he showed no interest.this item is also very durable. our son carries it around and drops it on our hard wood floors.  he also turns it over and bangs on it like a drum.  it is still working great!unlike other musical toys, the sounds and music from this item are pleasant, even to adults.  it makes water sounds and has a musical song with a calypso like flair.we have had several other children over our house and this fishbowl attracts them all.  after visiting, several of the parents have purchased a fish bowl of their own upon seeing their child's enthusiasm for the toy.",old loved start younger bat kick make music watch fish swim around older flutter bowl taking great fine motor skill development rolled floor inside old remains favorite toy fish bowl toy soft style durable around hard wood still musical music pleasant water musical song several children house fishbowl several fish bowl upon seeing enthusiasm toy,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we used this first for my son when he was a newborn, and the sounds seemed to stimulate, more than they relaxed him.  later, when he was learning how to pull up, he got plenty of bruises on his head from falling on the aquarium.  even now,  at 1 year-old,  he gets excited,  looses his balance, and bangs his head.  every time he does this, i take it out, then change my mind, and affix it back to the crib.  this aquarium offers different settings: you can turn the lights off and on,  simply play the various soothing melodies, or set the option that stimulates the aquarium/water while the melody plays with the fish moving.  it even inclues a volume feature.  however,  there are some drawbacks.  it is designed to hang on the top of the crib as most all crib toys are. yet, it's hard for babies to see the fish once you lower the mattress.  for my son,  the result of it being attached so high is he stands up to see the visuals - which defeats the purpose of this being a night-time soother.  if you opt to affix it at their eye level at the bottom of the crib,  babies (5 or even 6 mos of age) can use it as a stool to climb in, around, and out of the crib.  for these reasons, and the bruises noted above,  i've recently opted to keep it out.  the aquarium is now placed on a table near his rocker,  and we sometimes play it while we rock him for the last bottle of the night.  i'm tired of moving it around and trying to find a safe place for it.  i wanted to love this aquarium...i had prepared myself to do,  but it just didn't work for us.  i wish the makers had cushioned the edges and made the screen bigger.  final recommendation: try it out.  it may work well for your little one as it did for so many reviewers here.  the price is not bad at all.",first newborn stimulate learning pull plenty head falling aquarium excited balance head every time change mind affix back crib aquarium different turn simply play various soothing set option melody fish moving volume feature hang top crib crib hard see fish lower mattress result high see purpose nighttime opt affix eye level bottom crib age use stool climb around crib recently keep aquarium table near rocker play rock last bottle night tired moving around trying find safe place wanted love prepared work wish screen bigger final recommendation try work well little many price bad,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my daughter received this for christmas when she was 4 months old, and the first time we turned it on for her it kind of freaked her out and we turned it off.  a couple weeks later we gave it another try and she's loved it ever since.  in the past she would thrash and cry on the occassions when we'd put her to bed wide awake.  but now we turn the aquarium on and she becomes mesmerized.  the music, lights, bubbles and swimming fish really mellow her out.  even the motor sound seems to soothe her.  i only wish the toy could hang lower so she could reach it while laying on her back.  now, as soon as we lower the side of her crib in the morning, and the aquarium lowers with it, she hits the button to start it.  also, there is a clam that opens and closes when a little ball is spun, but it is barely noticable and just not very exciting.update: 9 months have passed since i first wrote my review, and during that time my daughter learned to stand up and manipulate things with her hands.  one morning we woke to hear her aquariuim blarring loudly.  she had cranked the volume all the way up and pressed the play button, and the loudness scared her and us.  now we keep the aquarium on her crib with the batteries removed, so she can still play with the non-powered parts.  i still feel this toy is good for little babies, but it would be better for big babies if the volume control were completely out of their reach.",daughter received christmas old first time kind couple try loved past thrash cry put bed wide awake turn aquarium mesmerized music swimming fish really mellow motor sound soothe wish toy hang lower reach laying back soon lower side crib morning aquarium button start clam little ball barely first review time daughter learned stand manipulate morning hear loudly volume way play button loudness scared keep aquarium crib removed still play still feel toy good little better big volume control completely reach,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this was my second favorite item i received for my son (after his ""kick and play bouncer"").  it was right up there because it was a god send in soothing my son and giving me some peace and quiet to go do a task or even just relax knowing his attention was occupied by something and not focused on wanting mommy!this item is beyond cute.  when he first got it as a newborn, the songs played the most important role.  and being able to choose between three different ones was good.  it was not too repetitive or boring.  when he became more alert, he would be able to lay on his back for hours just gazing at the dim lights flickering on and off and at the fishies and bubbles.  now at 9-months-old we put him in his crib sitting and he goes at it.  he's wild with glee watching it and hitting the toys on it.  the songs still sooth him to sleep--this is a much better investment that a mobile for the muscial factor and also much better for keeping their attention.  he's also able to turn it off and on himself and that's great because it's like an additional toy for him with a ""reward"" because it's a big flat button that goes along the bottom.  you just press it on and off.  (there is also of course a regular button to use to turn it completely off.)this product was very easy to attach to the crib and also easy to wipe down.  i absolutely love it.  it has three different ""settings"" so let's say you don't want the music but just the bubbles/lights you can do that.  or you can have just the music so the sound of the bubbles is not heard.  very versatile; excellent product.",second favorite received kick play bouncer right god send soothing giving peace quiet go task relax knowing attention focused wanting beyond cute first newborn important role able choose three different good repetitive boring alert able lay back hours dim flickering put crib wild glee still sooth much better investment mobile muscial much better keeping attention able turn great additional toy reward big flat button bottom press course regular button use turn completely product easy attach crib easy wipe absolutely love three different say music music sound versatile excellent product,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i really was excited when i saw the commercial for this product. i rushed out and bought it for my new baby. fisher price would have a complete winner if they would make only two minor changes!first of all, the button to turn it on and off is right between two ""toys"" on the aquarium. the on/off feature should be in the back with the rest of the controls.secondly, the motor is way too loud! i'm sure technology allows for a much more quiet motor.i would gladly pay [amt] more for this product if it included these two changes. i was completely satisfied with the choices of music and sounds. the songs are better, more modern versions of traditional nursery songs. the sounds of the ocean and waves are cool, but sort of drowned out by the motor. you have to turn the sound up pretty loud to drown out the noise of the motor. the lights could be a tad bit brighter.even with the few flaws, this product is still great. i hope someone from fisher price reads this review and makes the changes soon.",really excited saw commercial product new baby fisher price complete winner make two minor button turn right two aquarium feature back rest motor way loud sure technology much quiet gladly pay product two completely satisfied music better modern traditional nursery ocean cool motor turn sound pretty loud drown noise motor bit product still great hope fisher price review soon,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this one is a favorite because:1. parents (and older babies and toddlers) can choose from several options, depending on how much activity or quiet is desired. at naptime, parents may opt to have only the music play, soothing baby to sleep. at playtime, the toy can be set so that the fish ""swim, bubbles go up through the water and music or the sound of bubbling water plays.2. the music is absolutely delightful, not that awful, tinny music that so many toys have. it really sounds like there is an orchestra inside the toy, fostering an early appreciation of good music. there are 3 tunes as well as the sound of bubbling water for those times when music isn't preferred. the music is soothing, gentle and lovely to listen to.3. young babies can simply watch the fish swim and listen to the music. as they get older, they can interact with the toy, pressing buttons or rolling a ball to make a clam open and close its mouth - or a starfish spin. delightful!4. the toy is sturdy, having survived several falls without a single crack, as well it should (since it is for babies).a lovely addition to any nursery!",favorite older choose several much activity quiet desired naptime opt music play soothing baby sleep playtime toy set fish swim go water music sound water music absolutely delightful awful tinny music many really orchestra inside toy fostering early appreciation good music well sound water music preferred music soothing gentle lovely listen young simply watch fish swim listen music get older interact toy rolling ball make clam open close mouth starfish spin toy sturdy several without single crack well lovely addition nursery,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this toy was a life saver when my daughter was an infant.  we would set it to the different aquarium sounds (rain, waves, etc.) without the lights when putting her in her crib at night.  it was soothing and comforting.  when we wanted her to just relax, we would add the lights and she was mesmerized.  the timer function is only about 10 mins or even less so sometimes i would have to sneak in and re-start it.  when she turned about 5 months old, she figured out how to turn it on and off so it actually became a distraction to her in the crib (she would become alert turning it on and off) so we had to take it out.  we had one of those octogonal shaped play-yards in the house and we attached it to that for play time.  personally i preferred the aquarium sounds to the music - the music is very new-agey.  but my aughter seemed to like the music and that's what's important.  only one caveat - we have an italian made crib and rails are all thin, we had a tough time securing it tightly.",toy life saver daughter infant set different aquarium rain without crib night soothing comforting wanted relax add mesmerized function less sneak restart old turn actually distraction crib become alert house play time personally preferred aquarium music music music important caveat crib thin tough time,,,,

Positive,Positive,"there are not too many toys to choose for crib entertainment that offer both night time and day time stimulation.  we original received an aquarium for each crib (we have triplets).  we returned one thinking that we would buy a different ones so we could rotate the toys between the three cribs.  we bought a leap pad touch and tug discovery book, but it is only good for day time play.  no lights.  so we ended up with 2 aquariums and one touch and tug book and have not been disappointed.the aquarium gives your child a soothing way to fall asleep and when he awakes whether it be from a nap during the day or at night, he can activate the aquarium and put him self back to sleep or entertain him self.it straps on to the side of the crib and had some height adjustment.  it does not hang near the bottom of the crib, it is more of a top rail toy.you can set the aquarium to do many different things.  the best thing is that it does have volume adjustment.  you can set it to soft or loud.  i believe that there is 4 different song settings, river flowing, raining and waves.  you can also have bubbles and lights or none.  it allows you to choose what you want, whether it just be lights and no bubbles or bubbles and no lights.when my boys are having a bad night, i set it to one of the water sounds and that usually soothes them to sleep.as your child gets older he will be able to interact with it more.  there is the large push button in the front that allows the child to turn it on and off.  this was a very exciting night when my son learned how to turn it on and off.  of course all night long we had to listen to it go on and off, no very soothing, but entertaining.  there is a little level on the right side that when they pull it down it makes the star fish spin.  there is a ball on the left side that when they roll it the clam opens his mouth to revel a pearl.now that my babies can stand they love playing with the switches and dials in the back.  we never know what will happen when they turn it on later.this a great toy for the crib.  it combines music and lights to create a soothing environment.",many choose crib entertainment offer night time day time stimulation original received aquarium crib thinking buy different rotate three leap pad touch tug discovery book good day time play ended touch tug book aquarium child soothing way fall asleep nap day night activate aquarium put self back sleep entertain side crib height adjustment hang near bottom crib top rail set aquarium many different best volume adjustment set soft loud believe different song river flowing none choose boys bad night set water child older able interact large push button front child turn exciting night learned turn course night long listen go soothing little level right side pull star fish spin ball left side roll clam mouth revel stand love back know happen turn great toy crib music create soothing environment,,,,

Positive,Positive,"okay, i have to say that this was actually the best toy for our child for her first year.  she loved the music, and sounds when she was a tiny infant.  when she got a little older, she started to learn how to push the buttons, and get music/sounds, or just watch the characters/bubbles move.  it got to the point that we were able to move the baby out of our room by the time she was 5 months old because, when she woke up - instead of crying, she would play with this toy, and that would tell us she was awake.the music is soothing, and our daughter loves the music (but it also has sounds - all are very soothing).  when she wakes up in the middle of the night, she plays with this, and puts herself back to sleep.  i would recommend putting this in the crib as soon as you can, so the child can get used to it.  and then when they can sleep on their stomach, encourage/play with the toy with them.our daughter is now almost a year old, and she still loves that toy.  it is very sturdy, and i really don't have any complaints.  the only reason why i gave 4 stars for education was because, it really just teachers her cause & effect.the only thing that i can think that i would warn people of is that once your child gets older, and starts to pull up, they will fiddle with the controls on the top, and may make the volume a little louder than what you would want the next time they hit the on switch.  so make sure you turn it down before you put them to bed at night.",okay say actually best toy child first year loved music tiny infant little older learn push get watch move point able move baby room time old play toy tell music soothing daughter music soothing middle night back sleep recommend crib soon child get sleep stomach toy daughter year old still toy sturdy really reason education really cause think warn people child older pull fiddle top make volume little louder next time hit switch make sure turn put bed night,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my daughter has had the ocean wonders aquarium for over a year now and she loves it just as much as i do.  when she was only a few months old, it was the only thing that would put her to sleep.  the volume, sounds (music and effects) and light/bubble controls are behind the front display (but easy for parents to get to) so curious cruisers are pretty much unable to adjust them.  there are several different settings available; for example, music with lights and no bubbles  or  water sounds with just lights.other than a blanket, i keep toys out of her crib, so i like that this aquarium hangs safely out of harms way from the crib rails.  now when i put her down for naps, she's not alone sitting there with only her blanket; if she needs a few minutes before she's ready to sleep, i hear her hit the large blue button on the front of the aquarium and music starts to play.  she is able to turn it on all on her own and she watches/listens until she falls asleep.  that's also how i know if she's awake from her nap.  through the monitor, i hear that soft music and i know my little girl is ready to play!this is truly such a blessing - it's entertaining, lulling and nice to look at.  she hardly ever fusses before naps and i know this aquarium is to thank.  instead of crying to get out of her crib, my daughter is able to calm herself at the push of a button!",daughter ocean aquarium year much old put sleep volume music behind front display easy get curious pretty much unable adjust several different available example music water blanket keep crib aquarium safely way crib put alone blanket ready sleep hear hit large blue button front aquarium music play able turn asleep know awake nap monitor hear soft music know little girl ready truly blessing nice look hardly know aquarium thank get crib daughter able calm push button,,,,

Positive,Positive,"my 2 year old  daughter enjoys playing with this toy.  she got it for her first birthday, and though she has used it the entire year, it is not the first toy she wants to play with, nor does she use it every day.the toy has some advantages to it though.  the three modes of play make it easy for a child to grow with this toy.  the first level just plays classical music, the second plays little bits, and the third is strictly an organ.  (my daughter is in the organ stage now)there are a few things i didn't find necessary in this toy.  1)  the rocking- my daughter never wanted to rock when she was on this toy.  in music mode, she would sometimes dance, but never on the piano.  2) the option to switch musicd modes (violin, flute, etc)  my daughter never had any interest in this.  they all sound pretty much the same, and they are tinny at best.  this is not even close to an accurate interpretation to what these instruments sound like.  they should stick with organ/piano.one wish for me was that they would have interchangable disks of different music- even i get tired of these same songs.all in all, i think all children should be exposed to music, and some way of playing it, and that's why i think this toy is worth having in your childs collection.",year old daughter toy first birthday entire year first toy play use every toy three play make easy child grow toy first level classical music second little third strictly organ daughter organ stage find necessary toy daughter wanted rock toy music mode dance piano option switch violin flute daughter interest sound pretty much tinny best close accurate interpretation sound stick wish different music get tired think children music way think toy worth collection,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this phone was on sale, so i decided to get it for my soon-to-be 1 year old. i think you can easily give this toy to a 9 month old and up, because once they start walking this toy will lose a lot of its appeal. that said, at 10 months, when she discovered it hidden in our office, she did love it. she loved to hit the buttons and listen to all of the sounds and music. the voice that announces all the numbers is kind of funny, but not the most annoying voice ever. the complaints i have about this toy are as follows: it's really heavy, and the cord is really short (that is probably for non-strangulation or something). anyway, when your child tries to lift up the receiver to talk, she will inevitably lift up the entire phone and then when she puts the receiver down, she is likely to drop the heavy phone on her foot. now that she is walking she is totally not interested in the phone. however, the packaging says that there is a pull cord hidden near the battery, so if your kid likes to drag things around by a cord, there may be some appeal to a walker, too.",phone decided get year old think easily give toy month old start toy lose lot appeal hidden office love loved hit listen music voice kind funny annoying voice toy really heavy cord really short probably anyway child lift receiver talk inevitably lift entire phone receiver likely drop heavy phone foot totally interested phone pull cord hidden near battery kid drag around cord appeal walker,,,,

Positive,Positive,"carcassonne was my gateway into the eurogame world.  i had played settlers of catan a few times before, but carcassonne was the one that really got me hooked.gameplay is very simple.  starting with one starting tile (or a 12-tile river which is now included in new editions of the game, whichever players choose), players take turns drawing a random tile and placing it in such a way that it fits seamlessly with other tiles that are already placed.  on his/her turn, a player can also place a piece--they're affectionately known as meeple--onto a feature (road, city, cloister or farm) on the tile just placed.  a player can't place a meeple on a feature that already has another meeple on it, but a two features each with their own meeple can be connected by subsequent tile placement, and that's where things really start to get hairy.carcassonne is a nice game because there's a lot of strategy involved, and a lot of ways in which forethought pays off, but there's not a lot of ways in which it's overtly aggressive.  there's no way to remove another player's meeple from the map (unless you're playing with one of the expansions that allows that), and a good working knowledge of how many of each type of tile is available can be very, very helpful.one caveat: you'll need a lot of space to play this game.  as there's no set size for the landscape, you may find it reaching out surprisingly far in many directions.other than that, i've got nothing negative to say about carcassonne.  it's fun for kids and adults, easy to pick up, and gameplay time using just the base game is usually pretty short (30-40 minutes).  enjoy!",gateway world really simple river new game whichever choose drawing random way already turn player place affectionately feature road city farm player place feature already two connected subsequent placement really start get nice game lot strategy involved lot forethought lot aggressive way remove map good knowledge many type available caveat need lot space play game set size landscape find surprisingly far many nothing negative say fun easy pick time using base game pretty short enjoy,,,,

Positive,Positive,"carcassonne is a game that has stood the test of time in my collection.  i've had this for probably 6 years or so, yet my wife and i still have fun every time we take this game out.  i've never been much on tile-laying games until i played this one.the version i bought included the first `river' expansion with it, so we've always used that to start the game.  the game is easy to learn (though scoring the farmers takes some getting used to).  you lay down a tile that has one or more features on it (city, farmland, roads, cloisters), and you can place a meeple (wooden people) on any one feature on that tile to claim it as your own, providing that it doesn't  connect to an entity that already has another meeple on it (i.e. you can't claim a road if somebody already has a meeple on it).  when an entity is completed, the meeple is removed and the owner receives points for the completed entity.  the game ends when the last tile is placed, then the final scoring takes place.the game plays from 2 to 5 players (6 players if you buy the inns and cathedrals expansion), and scales fairly well.  the tiles are sturdy  and colorful, and the meeples stand out nicely when placed on them.  it's pretty cool to stand back and look at the map you've created when the game is done, too.one of the best things about carcassonne is the many expansions that are available.  they let you add different elements to the game that tweak the rules a bit to add layers of strategy without making the game too difficult.  these range in size and price, and each one adds a slightly different twist to an already-excellent game.",game test time collection probably wife still fun every time game much games version first river expansion weve start game game easy learn lay city farmland place wooden people feature claim connect entity already claim road already entity completed removed owner completed entity game last final game buy expansion fairly well sturdy colorful stand nicely pretty cool stand back look map game best many available let add different game tweak bit add strategy without game difficult range size price slightly different twist game,,,,

Positive,Positive,"sometimes you can feel the hype surrounding a game long before you ever play it.  such was the case with carcassonne, a staple among rio grande's catalog since the year 2000 and a game that has spawned literally dozens of expansions and spin-offs.  if all of these facts weren't quite enough to hint toward a winner, the game comes decorated with a host of awards it managed to earn along its storied decade of existence.written originally by klaus-jurgen wrede, carcassonne originally came into being in germany by a firm called hans im gluck and like most rio grande games, was translated into english and reintroduced to the north american market shortly thereafter.  the illustration credit goes to doris matthaus and jay tummelson rounds out the roster as the man behind the english translation.consisting merely of 84 cardboard land tiles, a single cardboard scoring track, 40 wooden pawns and a color rule sheet, i wasn't sure what to expect going in.  it turns out that the reason for the game's near-legendary status among hardcore fans and casual gamers alike has more to do with simplicity in its game mechanics and a highly addictive formula that's nearly subliminal to learn but limited only to the imaginations of the players involved.the system, which is deceptively simple, works like this: players begin by shuffling then stacking the 83 land tiles then place the start tile in the center of the table. they then take turns drawing a tile from the stack and placing it immediately, in other words, no one ever has tiles in their hand.  laying the tiles is quite intuitive in nature as the only rules to follow are to make sure the roads connect.  the strategy comes in the form of the scoring mechanic, which is derived at by when and where a player decides to place his pawns.  pieces in the city segments are labeled knights and score 2 points per tile, pieces on the roads become thieves and earn a single point per tile.  pawns placed in the cloister (monks) can earn 9 points and farmers can make oodles of points depending on how many nearby cities they supply with goods.about the trickiest part is of course learning the scoring method/ point breakdowns (some pieces are scored immediately then the pawns returned to the player's inventory while others, like the farmers, aren't scored until the end of the round).  the game comes to its conclusion once all of the tile pieces have been placed.  since there is an east-to-follow scoring card included, the need for a calculator or scratch paper is pretty much eliminated entirely.rounds take around 45 minutes but that time seems to decrease to closer to a half hour as players get into the swing of things.  the recommended requirement of ages 8 and up seems pretty on par but, and as i've discovered is the case with many games, much of this has to do with the way the rules are presented in the book/ grasping the game for the first time.  it would appear that teaching the game to others once an adult has a firm grasp on it could very well open up the game's playability to children of nearly all ages as the mechanics are brilliantly simplistic.the art itself is nothing too fancy or elaborate, which most certainly contributes to the game's user-friendly charm.  pieces are all easy to identify and it really doesn't take long before the table is just completely occupied by sprawling cities and villages.  an additional bonus to tile-laying games like this is that it is literally a new game each and every time it is played.  since there is no permanent game board, there are no patterns to learn or unfair advantages for veteran players over beginners.in all, i find the game to be quite enjoyable and almost relaxing in its mechanic.  never does it feel like a direct competition between players so much as an opportunity to create various landscapes while earning points in the process.  while the core game supports 2-5 players, this is one of few titles that can truly boast intuitive couple-play.  in other words, playing with just one other person never feels like a scaled down version of the ""real"" experience.like so many timeless classic board games before it, carcassonne's greatest strength and most enduring attribute would have to be its clever simplicity.  it can be enjoyed by players of nearly any age and level of experience, doesn't grow old quickly, and offers up enough strategy to keep players coming back for more.  it's hard to imagine a more successful formula than that!",feel hype surrounding game long

Positive,Positive,"germany delivers again with a very enjoyable--yet highly strategic--board game. assorted tiles about 40 in number can be drawn by two to five players from a box. the player then connects the tile to the main board, where the depictions of grass, castle and road drawings must correspond to other adjacent tiles. once a tile is placed, the player may place a piece on the board, and these men help the player garnish points through completing streets, castles, monasteries or fields. the fun of the game involves the luck of the draw and the strategy of whether to build up your creations or make it difficult for the other participating players.my wife and i laid the foundation for our relationship while playing this game during our courtship, and we continue to play in our marriage. we rate carcassonne among the board game titans of settlers of catan and scrabble.",highly game assorted number two five box player main board grass castle road correspond adjacent player place piece board help player fun game luck draw strategy build make difficult wife foundation relationship game courtship continue play marriage rate board game scrabble,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this is a tile-placement game.  square tiles have roads, monasteries, cities and farmland printed on them.  each player in turn reveals a tile and places it such that all edges match edges already placed.  for instance, a road has to connect to a road, it can not just stop.  once a player places a tile, they can claim part of the tile (road, farmland, city, or monastery).  as these features grow the player gets more points.  monasteries do not grow, points are gained by filling in the nine surrounding spaces.the skill comes from knowing just what to claim.  each player has a limited number of claim tokens.  once a feature is completed (road, city or monastery), the points are collected and the claim token becomes available for use again.  players must balance their use of the tokens and work to complete features so they can claim even more.  one trick is to complete a short road or small city (just two tiles, sometimes three) and then claim it, thus getting the points and getting the claim token back immediately.this is a quick game.  playing time is relatively short (thirty minutes or so) and play is easy.  no two games are ever the same thus keeping the game fresh.  a fun game for two to six players.  the game is reasonably small and easy to transport.  pieces are cardboard tiles and wooden claim tokens.  if you are looking for a fun game that doesn't take hours, then this one might be for you.",game square farmland player turn match already road connect road stop player claim part road farmland city monastery grow player grow nine surrounding skill knowing claim player limited number claim feature completed road city monastery claim token available use balance use work complete claim trick complete short road small city two three claim claim token back quick game time relatively short thirty play easy two games keeping game fresh fun game two six game reasonably small easy transport cardboard wooden claim looking fun game hours,,,,

Positive,Positive,"carcasonne - a cool strategy card laying game - succeeds brilliantly because of its simplicity, strategic depth, and atmospheric beauty.  game play is simple - a river is laid out creating the start for a growing medieval world of fields, roads, rivers, monasteries, and fortified cities.  these features are on the playing cards the players lay down as tiles.  as the game progresses the area of tiled cards grows, painting a medieval landscape in front of you.you have a limited number of playing pieces which you use to take possession of roads, cities, monasteries, or fields for farming as you play your cards.  you get points for completing these items - and whether you complete them depends on the cards you draw - and also on the choices other players make when tiling down their cards.  when an item is completed you get your playing piece back and can use it to take possession of new features on the next card you lay down.  where and how you put cards down is constrained by the features of the card, and what's already been played.  for example you must play a card with road on it only if there's already road - or a road terminus adjacent (no hanging roads - or cities).  you work alone, but also sometimes in cooperation with other players (it's possible for two player's cities to merge in to one, then it benefits you both if you finish).  farming is complicated - but it's about controlling areas of contiguous field.  since the field areas are being created as the cards are laid down - there's an element of chance as well as strategy.  the cards themselves are simple yet pretty and atmospheric.  the game play is cutthroat - yet the visuals of pretty fortified medieval cities and fields, roads and streams is serene and soothing.  this combination of attributes is compelling.  this is a really fun game that gets the juices flowing.as others have noted, except for farming, the rules are simple and kids can play (i'd say kids 8 and up).  this game is sophisticated enough for even jaded gaming adults too.  it's a great family game, and great thing to bring on weekend retreats (because it's quiet and non-electric).  it's  got fantastic replay value too.",cool strategy card laying game brilliantly simplicity strategic depth beauty game play simple river start growing medieval world fortified lay game painting medieval landscape front limited number use possession farming play get complete depends draw make tiling completed get piece back use possession new next card lay put card already example play card road already road road adjacent work alone cooperation possible two merge finish farming complicated element chance well strategy simple pretty game play cutthroat pretty fortified medieval serene soothing combination really fun game others except farming simple play say game sophisticated enough great family game great bring weekend quiet fantastic replay value,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this is a fun game for kids and adults alike. it's a bit more complicated than your ""classic"" (monopoly, not chess) board game, but the strategy and interaction that this complication enables makes this game a winner.the basic gameplay is simple: several tiles are turned face down, with some number of tiles turned up. on your turn, you pick up a face down tile, turn it face up, and place it next to any face up piece. then you must decide if you want to claim a particular section of that tile (the field, or the road, or the city, or the church). claiming a section can earn you points, but you only have a limited number of men to use! each section on a piece is essentially an investment with some amount of risk. road are fairly low risk, with a fairly low investment time, but also a typically low payout. cities are a higher risk, with higher payout, but a longer investment time. churches and fields have their own risk vs reward as well.overall, a fun game, lasting about 45 minutes per session. typical turn lenths are about 10-20 seconds long, and the limited number of expansions that i've tried have been nice additions as well. great for both casual gamers and lighter fare for more serious gamers.",fun game bit complicated classic monopoly chess board game strategy interaction complication enables game basic simple several number turn pick turn place next piece decide claim particular section road city church section earn limited number use section piece essentially investment amount risk road fairly low risk fairly low investment time typically low payout higher risk higher payout longer investment time risk reward fun game lasting session typical turn long limited number tried nice well great casual lighter fare serious,,,,

Positive,Positive,"winner of the prestigious spiel des jahres (german game of the year) in 2001, carcassonne is quite simply one of the best board game we've ever played. the unique concept behind carcassonne has players actually constructing the board as they play, interlocking the finely-crafted selection of 72 tiles that comprise the game and scoring points based on how many cities, roads, fields and cloisters (monk houses) they develop and control. since the game board may expand in any direction a large table is preferred, unless you can play on the floor and avoid toddlers, pets and other tile-disturbing hazards.highly recommended for families and friends aged 10 and above.",winner prestigious game year simply best board game weve unique behind actually board play selection comprise game many monk develop control game board expand direction large table preferred play floor avoid recommended,,,,

Positive,Positive,"carcassonne: 2-5 players, ages 8+, average play time = 60 minutesi was very surprised by how much this game grew on me. at first, i was skeptical by the fact that you didn&#8217;t have a hand and were at the mercy of whatever tile you drew. in the beginning of the game, you won&#8217;t have that many choices in terms of placement, but towards the end, you&#8217;ll be trying to screw up your opponent&#8217;s scoring chances while trying to resolve your own.keeping along those lines, i personally enjoyed how strategic the game turned out to be. i was constantly thinking of ways to extend my son&#8217;s city (the one he had a follower on) so that he&#8217;d never be able to complete it. he&#8217;d still earn one point per city tile at game end, but that was significantly less than the two points per tile he could have earned.resisting the urge to place all of my followers in the beginning became a real challenge. i saw a lot of potential fields that future cities might connect to, but i had to make sure i had enough in reserve to score on the more immediate opportunities. since you and your opponent are limited to how many followers you have, it becomes a battle of wits to see who claims what first and who is able to save enough for when it counts.out of all of the game mechanics, the scoring was the hardest for me to pick up on. at times, i was scratching my head on how farmers scored and what fields were considered theirs. once you overcome this initial learning curve, play is relatively fluid. luckily, the manual is fairly easy to understand when trying to put it all together.i should also mention that this game has a ton of expansions, which shoots up this game&#8217;s replay value tenfold. it seems like there is always something new to keep the game fresh and interesting. not all of the expansions will appeal to everyone, but having the option alone is a plus in my book.carcassonne is a great game to introduce to players that are new to the wonderful world of board games, especially if you have an experienced player on hand to help with the scoring and flow of play. it&#8217;s also a great game for players of all ages (within reason), so if you are in the market for something relatively easy that provides a fair amount of depth, then you may want to look into this game further.",average play time surprised much game first skeptical fact hand mercy whatever beginning game many placement trying screw trying resolve personally strategic game constantly thinking extend city follower able complete still earn point city game significantly less two urge place beginning real challenge saw lot potential future connect make sure enough reserve score immediate opponent limited many battle see first able save enough game hardest pick head overcome initial learning curve play relatively fluid luckily manual fairly easy understand trying put mention game replay value new keep game fresh interesting appeal everyone option alone plus great game introduce new wonderful world board games experienced player hand help flow play great game within reason market relatively easy fair amount depth look game,,,,

Positive,Positive,"carcassonne is a pure strategy game. no dice, not much luck involved, and the board is never the same because the players build it as you go along. essentially you are building cities and roads one piece at a time and have a limited number of tokens (""meeples"") with which to 'claim' them as you lay them down. once you've claimed a build in progress no one else can, although two 'claimed' items in progress can be built into each other and cause it to be split or even stolen from the player with more meeples in it.there are other things to claim like fields and abbeys and there are a great number of expansions. i'd recommend inns and cathedrals and also traders and builders and get your hands on the ""river ii"". there are large box sets combining many of these, but do your research and make sure you're getting a good deal by buying one of those first... sometimes you are better off trying the base game, then reading how the various expansions work and adding them in.the only luck involved with the game is when you draw the piece you will be trying to lay each round. if you play your meeples wisely it will be unusual you have a tile that is of no use to you. however, even if you do draw a useless tile you can sometimes use it to 'block' another players efforts. (after the ""river"" tiles are played i'd recommend having players draw a tile at the end of their turn rather than the start so that they can be thinking about where to place it while others are placing there - it'll move the game along a little quicker).i enjoy carcassonne more than settlers of catan because carcassonne is more versatile in layout and you aren't rolling dice to get your points. you build an item, which gives you point if unfinished at the end of the game, or you get points for (sometimes more as a result of) finishing something you are building (at which point you get your meeple back to place on a new tile, thereby giving you the chance to make more points before the game ends).the game pieces are good quality. they are not going to bend or break without a lot of effort. i suspect you'll eventually see a little wear on their surfaces if you are rough with them. if you become a big fan, or you just like to customize your games a bit, check out a online store called ""meeple source"" as they have a lot of cool game tokens for carcassonne (and other games).there's also nothing stopping you from making your own game pieces. if you want some interesting alternate pieces or want to inject something new into the game there's no reason you can't go get some (very) heavy card stock and create your own add on's.there is an ap version of this game you might want to try out to see if you're like it. the android version is only the basic game with the river ii expansion, pretty simple. the iphone/ipad version is far more robust and includes many of the expansions.",pure strategy game dice much luck involved board build go essentially building piece time limited number claim lay build progress else two progress cause split player claim great number recommend get river large box many research make sure good deal buying first better trying base game reading various work luck involved game draw piece trying lay round play unusual use draw useless use block river recommend draw turn start thinking place others move game little enjoy versatile rolling dice get build point unfinished game get result building point get back place new thereby giving chance make game game good quality going bend break without lot effort suspect see little wear rough become big fan games bit check online store source lot cool game nothing game interesting alternate new game reason go get heavy card stock create add version game try see android version basic game river expansion pretty simple version far robust many,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i am glad that i bought this game.  it does not involve any money or any pen and paper (which is rather unusual!)  scoring is done by moving people around a 50 point track, and if you lap it, you get a 50 point card in addition to whatever else you have on the point track.  this keeps the focus on the game-play, while still allowing for a point reference throughout the game.the pieces (and the box) are of high quality, and the game can be enjoyed by children as well as adults.another reason i like this game is that two players can play this game alone, and sometimes it is hard to find games like that. you typically have two owners of a game and a third person (a friend?) who comes over and plays less often and is always at a disadvantage.also, the game doesn't last too long. you are not going to get bogged down for hours, and you can ""get a game in"" before you go to bed, or before you go out.if you enjoy this game, there are some expansion sets to this game that you can also purchase.  they each add additional pieces and additional rules, and they change the strategy and make it more interesting (just when you might have been getting tired with the game!)they are the following:carcassonne inns & cathedralscarcassonne traders & builderscarcassonne the princess and the dragoncarcassonne the towercarcassonne the river (sort of a mini-expansion)if, however, you think you would like to purchase them all at once, instead of one by one down the road, you can elect to purchase the ""carcassonne: big box"" instead.  this contains the full original game as well all of the expansions listed above.  it is bundled together at a big discount, and as well as with a big space savings -no extra boxes lying around.in addition, if you enjoy carcassonne, you can also purchase separate standalone games related to carcassonne, but which are not expansions, and which cannot be played as part of the original game (or any of the expansions listed above).they are the following:carcassonne hunters & gathererscarcassonne the castlecarcassonne the citycarcassonne the ark of the covenantfinally, for those who enjoyed this game, i must also recommend other strategy games from the manufacturer, rio grande games.  i have also purchased the strategy card games ""lost cities"" and ""san juan"" from this manufacturer, and have enjoyed them immensely as well!",glad game involve money pen paper unusual moving people around point track get point card addition whatever else point track focus still point reference throughout box high quality game children well reason game two play game alone hard find games typically two game third person friend less often game last long going get hours get game go bed go enjoy game expansion game purchase add additional additional change strategy make interesting tired princess river think purchase road elect purchase big box full original game well together big discount well big space savings extra addition enjoy purchase separate standalone games part original game game recommend strategy games manufacturer games strategy card games lost manufacturer well,,,,

Positive,Positive,"it took me forever to get around to buying this game. then it took me forever to get around to actually playing it. now that i have, i have discovered that i absolutely love it!at its heart, this is a very simple game that pretty much anyone should be able to figure out and enjoy. it has beautiful artwork, and a fun theme. when i see the cards i get that scrooge mcduck or indiana jones feeling of adventure and going on a search for lost treasure. the game is extremely short, and you can play it in about 15 minutes. if you want to keep going (or even the odds due to the random nature of the game) you can play as many rounds as you want. all-in-all, i'd say it's about as perfect a game for good friends or married couples as you can get.now for the negative:i suppose if you wanted to, you could play it using just a regular desk of playing cards. like most card-playing games (that aren't deck-builders) you are probably going to get bored if you play it endlessly against the same person (the awesome guillotine has the same weakness, the same person always wins). some people won't care for the theme. with heavy use, the cards will likely wear out. the game is a bit pricey for such a simple game. and of course, the included instructions are little tricky to figure out the first time (play it once and you'll figure it out easily), and some people are going to want a game that's more in-depth (complex).overall:none of the negatives of this game outweigh the positives in my opinion. if you can enjoy a simple game with a colorful, fun theme for two (and about as much strategy as any game you play with a deck of playing cards) you will enjoy this game. you could play it with a regular deck of playing cards, but i like games with some nice flavor, artwork, etc, and this game delivers. if this game is too simple for you, try netrunner or dominion. as for me...i love it. excellent!",forever get around buying game forever get around actually absolutely love heart simple game pretty much able figure enjoy beautiful artwork fun see get feeling adventure going search lost treasure game extremely short play keep going odds due random nature game play many say perfect game good married suppose wanted play using regular desk games probably going get bored play endlessly person awesome weakness person people heavy use likely wear game bit simple game course little tricky figure first time play figure easily people going game game outweigh opinion enjoy simple game colorful fun two much strategy game play deck enjoy game play regular deck games nice flavor artwork game game simple try dominion love excellent,,,,

Positive,Positive,"lost cities is a quick playing card game for two that involves constant choices of calculated risk.each player will have a hand of eight cards, and on their turn will play or discard one of them and then draw to replace it .  there are five possible ""expeditions"" (card piles, separately by player) that can be played to, corresponding to the five colors of cards in the deck.  for each of the five colors there are three investment cards and one card for each number 2-10.there are three key rules that shape strategies:1) once you start an expedition, it will be scored.  score is the total value of the cards played there minus 20 (investment cards multiply score).  this makes starting a pile risky and discourages haphazard playing.2) additional cards in an expedition must be higher in value than previously played cards (investment cards are the lowest ""value"").  this adds depth to choices about what to play vs keep in your hand, as well as making awareness of your opponent's cards important since there is only one copy of each numeric card.3) cards can be drawn from the top of the deck or from the top of one of the face up discard piles (one for each color).  being aware of a card's usefulness to your opponent is just as important as it's usefulness to you when deciding to discard.everything fits together well to form an easy to teach game that's a lot of fun and won't take forever to play.  well, one game won't at least, but i have played for hours at a time before...the theme is purely decorative.  this is a numeric based card game and anyone looking for something that captures a bit of the feeling of exploration will not find it here.  that said the art is well done and gives the game a nice style.lost cities is beautifully designed and executed and is easily my favorite two player only game.highly recommended.note: if you like lost cities you may want to check out the board game version.  it plays 2-5 and incorporates some of the core mechanics found here.  this is the better game, but both are well done and a lot of fun.",lost quick card game two constant calculated player hand eight turn play discard draw replace five possible card piles player five deck five three investment card number three key shape start expedition score total value minus investment multiply score pile risky haphazard additional expedition higher value investment lowest value depth play keep hand well awareness important copy numeric top deck top discard piles color aware usefulness opponent important usefulness deciding together well form easy teach game lot fun forever play well game least hours time purely decorative numeric card game looking bit feeling exploration find art well game nice beautifully easily favorite two player lost check board game version core better game well lot fun,,,,

Positive,Positive,"for those who don't spend their time concerning themselves with international board game affairs, rio grande games is a company who basically searches out some of the very best strategic board games around the globe, brings them to the united states, translates them into english then unleashes their addictive tendencies to a whole new unsuspecting civilization.keeping that in mind, lost cities is exactly one such game, written by the legendary reiner knizia.  made originally in germany by a company called kosmos back in 1999, rio grande brought the game to north america shortly thereafter and has released subsequent identical new editions every few years since due to unwavering demand.  the object of the game, in its very simplest terms, is to end up with the most points after as many rounds as you seem fit (a round takes between 20 and 40 minutes, although, i can attest that after several hundred of them, expect that time to decrease to around 12 minutes).lost cities is perhaps the most addicting strategy game i've ever played and that's saying a lot considering i frequent rio grande's immense catalog very often!  all the game consists of is a fairly small foldout board and 60 cards.  the player is responsible for the pen, paper, and possibly calculator required to do battle.  like all rio grande games, the quality of the materials and detailed artwork are second to none, however, don't expect to be spending much of your time studying the pictures because once you grasp the game's mechanics, it's quick and intense with good-decision making becoming the key to victory.the game is structured to offer players 5 worldly locations (egypt, atlantis, a volcanic island, and the himalayas) with which to attempt an expedition (which in this case means a sequential run of cards beginning with the lowest possible (2) and ending with the highest possible (10)).  additionally the player has the option of playing investor cards, which act as multipliers for the total points at the end of the round.  the trouble is, fail to clear the investment of the expedition and these cards multiply your losses as well.  it sounds rather simplistic in my summary but the game simply does everything right!  it's easy to learn, fun to play, and extremely addicting.  the winner of each round isn't often known until after all of the points are tallied, which undoubtedly adds to the tension of earlier decision making.perhaps the game's greatest strength is the simple fact that like classics such as checkers and tic-tac-toe, it accomplishes an incredible amount of game play with minimal physical setup.  there are no timers, dice, stats, or massive-choice options to consider.  rather the game is as simple as tossing and drawing cards while watching what your opponent is doing on the other side of the board.  it has the charm of card games like uno but with far more strategic and replay value.it is designed only for 2 players and the recommended age requirement is 10 & up.  i strongly recommend this game as a fantastic way to pass the hours of cold winter nights.",spend time international board game games company basically best strategic board games around globe english addictive whole new unsuspecting mind lost exactly game legendary company back game north america shortly subsequent identical new every due unwavering demand game simplest many fit round attest several expect time decrease around addicting strategy game lot frequent immense often game fairly small board player responsible pen paper possibly calculator battle games quality detailed artwork second none expect spending much time studying grasp games quick intense becoming key game offer worldly volcanic island attempt expedition means sequential run beginning lowest possible ending highest possible additionally player option investor act total round trouble fail clear investment expedition multiply well simplistic summary game simply everything right easy learn fun play extremely addicting winner round often undoubtedly tension decision games greatest strength simple fact incredible amount game play minimal physical setup dice consider game simple drawing opponent side board charm card games far strategic replay recommended age requirement strongly recommend game fantastic way pass hours cold winter,,,,

Positive,Positive,"this game is deceptively simple.  it's easy to learn, but hard to score (have paper and pen!  or a scientific calculator!  which most iphones and androids have by turning screen sideways when in standard calculator).basically two players each draw cards keeping 8 in hand.  on their turn they play expedition cards (or handshakes) on their side of the board or discard a card into a discard stack matching the color of the discard.  then they draw a new card.  each card has a color which corresponds to a particular expedition.  players score points by advancing their expeditions.  handshakes multiply the points total.  when the draw stack is exhausted, play ends and players tally their score.but wait!  each expedition costs 20 points to start, so you want to be able to just start every expedition.  and you can only play handshakes before playing the numbered expedition cards.  and you always have to play a higher expedition number than the one previous!  so lots of room for strategy and for massive point loss!  if you play handshakes but don't start an expedition in time (with a numbered card) then the 20 point cost is multiplied!so the game requires a bit of math and planning skill.  it's not for younger folks who might not grasp the pre-algebraic formula (the multiplying of the handshakes with the numbered expeditions), but with parental assistance, i don't think it's too complicated for 10 and up.  it's really best as a 'relationship' game.  meaning partners or room mates can play easily.  each round is about 15 minutes but can last up to 30 minutes depending on the skill and experience of the players and their focus.  because you don't need 100% focus to play this game.  it's easy to play at a coffee shop or even while watching a rerun on tv (or a sports match).bottom line, it's made for two players, easy to learn, and lots of fun.  the only true two-player-only euro game i put ahead of this is rivals for catan.  but unlike rivals for catan (their two player version of catan) this game is easier to learn and quicker to play.",game deceptively simple easy learn hard score paper pen scientific calculator screen sideways standard two draw keeping hand turn play expedition side board discard card discard stack color discard draw new card card color particular expedition score multiply total draw stack exhausted play tally wait expedition start able start every expedition play expedition play higher expedition number room strategy massive point loss play start expedition time card point cost game bit math skill younger grasp formula parental assistance think complicated really best relationship game meaning room play easily round last skill experience focus need focus play game easy play coffee shop sports line two easy learn fun true euro game put ahead two player version game easier learn quicker play,,,,

(i figure you need as much space to lay down your cards as the size of a typical monopoly board).playing note: one thing that was initially a little confusing to us when we were reading the instructions, was that the instructions do not explain that you are to place your cards on the opposite side of the board as your opponent.  you can each play all 5 expeditions, in a head to head manner.  we were sitting on a couch at a coffee table, and we had turned the board horizontally to face us (instead of vertically) and the instructions were confusing until we moved the board 90 degrees.  the game designers assumed that you would play the game as one would play a game of checkers, sitting across from one another, but you don't actually have to play this way, even though you do need to turn your board for the same effect.this game is really fun and i would highly recommend other games from the same manufacturer (rio grande games).  they really have a knack for publishing great strategy games.  they even release expansion sets to their popular games, and they credit the players who gave them the ideas for the expansion cards.  pretty neat!",game great way pass twenty thirty easy learn lose money count numerous equal amount luck skill involved good really liked game two people tired games two really three deck game small board note make game really portable need bring board place put way help organize long pencil paper game play everywhere table figure need much space lay size typical monopoly note little confusing reading explain place opposite side board opponent play head head manner couch coffee table board horizontally vertically confusing board game play game play game actually play way need turn board game really fun highly recommend games manufacturer games really knack great strategy games release expansion popular games credit expansion pretty neat,,,,

Positive,Positive,"lost cities is a simple card game for two people. there is a deck of cards and a play mat (yes, that's all!). the goal is to gain the most points by playing expedition cards in the 5 expedition areas: the sands of egypt, the watery depths of atlantis, the icy wastes of tibet, the jungles of the amazon, and the volcanic mountains of ... mars? mexico? sicily? i'm not sure about the last one. players take turns drawingfrom the deck and playing an expedition card. you keep 8 cards in your hand throughout the entire game. on your turn, you either play an expedition card (numbered 2-10), a funding card, or a card to a discard pile, and draw a card from either the deck or the top discard.each player plays on his/her own side of the playmat, so you do not interfere with each other's expeditions. you cannot play a lower expedition card than the top one in your pile (you've already passed it by), so there's some tension in whether to hold, discard, or play. funding cards must be played before any expedition cards, and they have a multiplicative effect on the points from that expedition; x2, x3, or x4, depending on how many funding cards you played (i keep thinking it is an exponential progression and not a geometric one, but a smarter man than me designed it).the game is over when the last card is drawn. points are awarded in the following way: you get -20 for starting an expedition, then you sum the value of each expedition card (2-10) and apply the funding multiplier to the sum, then sum over all expeditions. i recommend using pen and paper. the funding cards make quite a difference; avoiding them yields a score in the single digits, while using them yields a score around 100. the risk multiplies with each funding card, though, since you multiply negative scores as well.in my experience, you always draw out the deck faster than you think. there are 60 cards total, so with 2 players, you need to be wrapping up after your 15th draw or so. you can expect to nearly complete 1 expedition and dabble in two others, so high cards in your off suit is helpful. drawing from the discard pile keeps the clock ticking longer, even if you don't want the cards. it's almost always worth starting an expedition if you have a 9&10, but 4,5,6 may not be good enough.the best part of the game is the beautiful artwork on the cards, which goes the full length. the colors are vibrant and depict a running scene of the terrain being explored, with some kind of ruins on card 10. it plays quicklly, no more than 15 minutes per game, and the strategy is fairly simple. that makes it an ideal game for just before bed.",lost simple card game two people deck play mat yes goal gain expedition expedition watery icy amazon volcanic sure last deck expedition card keep hand throughout entire game turn play expedition card funding card card discard pile draw card deck top player side interfere others play lower expedition card top pile already tension hold discard play funding expedition multiplicative effect expedition many funding keep thinking progression geometric smarter game last card following way get expedition sum value expedition card apply funding multiplier sum sum recommend using pen paper funding make difference avoiding score single using score around risk funding card multiply negative experience draw deck faster think total need draw expect complete expedition two others high suit helpful drawing discard pile clock longer worth expedition good best part game beautiful artwork full length vibrant depict running scene terrain kind card game strategy fairly simple ideal game bed,,,,

Positive,Positive,"playing structured games is a good way for a child to learn many skills, including counting, matching and the beginnings of strategic thought.  this game is excellent because it can immediately be played even by a two-year-old, although not with perfect strategy.  the game, in other words, allows for some growth of the player without growing old.  some of the things a young player will gradually learn to incorporate:- placing a token for an animal card on the best of two squares available(early on, a new player will naturally just pick the first one found)- using the free squares in advance- saving ""power"" cards (dragon and unicorn) for when needed / most useful- blocking opponents' best movesjust learning to play a turn-based game is a big milestone for a little one.  this game is as good as it gets for sustaining the child's interest, reinforcing many intellectual skills, and growing with the child.  you can't go wrong for the price.  see my other reviews and you will realize that i don't give praise lightly! :)",games good way child learn many including counting strategic thought game excellent immediately perfect strategy game growth player without growing old young player gradually learn incorporate token animal card best two new player naturally pick first using free advance saving power dragon unicorn useful best learning play game big little game good interest many intellectual growing child go wrong price see realize give praise,,,,

(it's nice for my 6 year old, because although he gets the game enough to play the adult version, he can't yet hold all of the cards in his hands for that one, so 3 cards are definatley better then 7 and the cards are almost half the size as regular cards.)  instead of having the normal playing cards of ace's - king's, these are all animals that differ enough that they don't get confused what card goes with what animal.  in this version instead of needed to get two rows of four in order to win, you only have to get one row of four.i'm glad that my 3 year old likes this game, of course we always have to remind her to draw a card after she plays a card, and she can't hold the cards in her hand yet (or at least doesn't care to) and she her strategy of the game is to put down the animals that she likes the best, she still is involved in the game and not left out at family game time.  it's nice to be able to include her in a game, without her gameplay messing us up, even though she doesn't understand how to strategize to win at 3 years old, she is just another person to make our gameplay harder.  as for my 6 year old, it is one of his favorite games.",husband love saw sequence get old board games much person version sequence get three start colored chips lay nice year old game enough play adult version hold better half size regular normal animals differ enough get confused card animal version get two order win get row glad year old game course remind draw card card hold hand least strategy game put animals best still involved game left family game time nice able include game without understand strategize win old person make harder year old favorite games,,,,

Positive,Positive,"i bought this game for my 4-year-old grandson. it is not challenging enough for him, although we happily played it and had a fun time. however, he was much more taken with junior monopoly (which requires an adult to do the reading until he memorizes the cards). the sequence game is really just another version of a bingo/tic tac toe-type game and he has at least one other game like that. for kids that are into games, though, i would say this is a decent choice. the learning is simply in figuring out a winning strategy; there is no content learning as the animals on the playing cards are ones that probably most 3-year-olds already know. one advantage of this game is that it is short, so if you have a small window of time to play a game, it's a good choice (versus monopoly, which is great for a long rainy afternoon).",game grandson enough happily fun time much junior monopoly adult reading sequence game really version game least game games say decent choice learning simply winning strategy content learning animals probably already know advantage game short small window time play game good choice monopoly great long rainy afternoon,,,,

Positive,Positive,"we've had this toy for over 7 years now. each kid loves it just the same! they love it! it's durable and more thought provoking due to it's dual-sided sorting. my only qualm about this toy is that in order to get the shapes out of the sorter, you have to unscrew the top (or bottom as they both unscrew). small ones can't do this themselves and they keep handing it to you over and over again to take them out. you can't leave one side unscrewed because then they tip it over to put in a shape and it falls out so each time it must be screwed back on. the positive value of this toy far surpasses the annoying negative though so don't take this as a reason to not buy the toy. it is a durable, wonderful toy!",weve toy kid love durable thought provoking due qualm toy order get unscrew top bottom unscrew small keep leave side tip put shape time back positive value toy far annoying negative reason buy toy durable wonderful toy,,,,
