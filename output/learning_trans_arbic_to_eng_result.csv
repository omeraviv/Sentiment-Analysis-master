"w barcelona offers residential services i stayed at the w barcelona from day to day, in a great room. i arrived early and registered my name at the hotel. the registration process is always busy, and there is a big and happy surprise but with mixed feelings. sometimes your early arrival leads you to a room that no one else wants. my share of room number, was on the fifth floor. the beach was opposite my room, but a third of the view was obstructing me due to the other prominent rooms at the front. this only affects the first floors, so be careful, as each room ends with a number that has the same problem. these rooms are also adjacent to the storage and laundry rooms, among others. i loved the design of the room, the shared desk with the bed is very soft, what a really good bed spoil me, as well as the spacious space. the shower space can accommodate five people, not joking, so let’s consider, for example, that you took your boyfriend to have sex for the first time. you will inevitably discover the peculiarities of their bathroom laughing out loud. i did not consume anything from the room fridge, as there is a big store and restaurants at the beginning of the beach, and this is a pleasant walk away. prices for the pool area and services are very moderate. on sunday, on the top floor, you do not stop by the pool, the staff working in this area did not check the area even once, so i did not receive any services. another day, i learned that the top floor was open, and i went up. i learned that it was closed when i asked for a service. then i learned that it is not closed, but there is no service. i was just meters away from the main bar. the position of the workers in this area is as if they say, i know, man, that we are very calm. we do a favor for you here. however, i left the area and did not return to it for the duration of my stay. hint i use the signs; i can&#39;t read minds, but if the staff is so lazy that they can&#39;t do the services upstairs, there&#39;s something wrong. at the nightclub, i was disappointed again because of the lack of communication, and the lack of signs or information about the region&#39;s protocols. i saw every two sitting on your sofas, so i had to leave completely. if there were signs, there would be no embarrassment for the people. after eleven o&#39;clock in the evening this region becomes private and the cost of staying in euros is where the excellent service provided by the workers once the place is opened. it seems that those who provide alcoholic beverages are good, but when they are busy like this then there will be speed, yet my drink was moderate. wave restaurant i had a very good meal, and a great attentive service made me happy. managers always work hard, but sometimes regret can be an easy backup. guest services what about the low seating for guests? sitting in this drop feels as if the seat is the one sitting on you, the opposite must be done, according to the known power arrangement. and we ended up changing rooms, on the number floor, room number, which is the same type of room as it overlooks a port, after i mentioned that the wonderful rooms are supposed to have nothing to obscure seeing from them. note that the warm rooms are located on floors from to; these rooms seem to be great except for rooms from to; all overlook the ocean and the harbor. as for all the large rooms and others overlooking the beach and the city location i did not find the location far from the old neighborhoods, so you can walk on foot, or take the bus number / which stops on the main road near the hotel entrance, and the price of the bus ticket. euros, and the taxi may cost you approximately euros. in general, i would probably come here again, as the location fits in with me, as is the layout of the room, the bathroom was excellent and the two rooms were reasonably quiet. it was a shame there was the low pool service as well as what is known as nerve cooling. as the title shows, this place caters to a specific demographic as it focuses on it well, but i am not a fashion fan, but all i want is comfort and kindness. it is a service.

"what makes someone special in his field is not just talent, but talent when it reaches the limit of madness ... i have always wondered ... who is where saramago comes with those imaginary societies? how can he weave a story where everything is so mixed up? in his writings, saramago always creates a state of collective awareness that moves society as a single block towards something, or towards a strange event ... in death interruptions, the writer imagines ... what if death feels bored one day, and then decides to stop? what will happen ? what is the impact of that on the people of this community? he wonders in blindness .. what if everyone becomes blind? what could happen in a community of blind people? how do people deal with this phenomenon? he wonders here in insight .. what if the people decide to challenge the government and not elect anyone? how does the government act on this? what will be the people&#39;s reaction to what the government did? questions you may see as silly and silly, but saramago grasps them wisely and weaves them into a solid and beautiful garment ... the answers to these questions, and the truth is said, illogical, and you may feel that they are unnatural .. but who said that saramago is natural or logical? didn&#39;t we just say that creativity that is not characterized by insanity is not creativity? another thing that distinguishes saramago is that he talks about the novel in a reader-style, not narrator, and you find him sometimes wondering what will happen in the novel after a while and update himself sometimes with thoughts on his mind ... what really exhausted me is the narration style .. long breathless phrases .. many, many lots of sentences the objection that requires a present mind to pass it ... i saw this before in the death interruptions and i thought it was a translation error, but i found it here too ... you can pass all this and enjoy it with a little patience, but if you are not patient, then i advise you to try. .

"the book is divided into two parts, the first part is the book itself, and the second part is the akp and turkish program. part one: the book. worth three stars. in my opinion, it was prepared by the second part of a previous book, but by another author, ali muhammad muhammad al-salabi. the book is the ottoman empire, the factors of the rise and the causes of the fall. the writer started the book from the time of the fall of the ottoman empire at the hands of ataturk and quickly passed through the most prominent events that it passed through, especially the islamic parties that took power like the national system party .. then he moved to a qualitative shift in the history of turkish rule, which is najm al-din erbakan and his parties safety, welfare and happiness . in this brief, the features of the turkish state, which are fiercely secular and loyal to the policies of mustafa kemal ataturk, are clear to us until the army interferes in its entirety if these principles are threatened and performs a military coup if necessary, as it did in a coup when it carried out a coup against the najmuddin government, the problem of the safety party. then the author moves to the axis of the book, which is erdogan, then he deals with the story of his origin and his disciples at the hands of erbakan, then he took over the istanbul municipality, then arrested him, then he left and set up for the justice and development party and passed on his three elections, the last of which was fought in the last year. the book in its entirety is good, especially in the tendency of dr. willing to simplify matters to suit the non-specialist. one of the bad deeds of the book was the photos in it. the book contained many pictures and it is an excellent way to clarify a lot of things, especially in maps and others, but the pictures here were misplaced and not selected accurately. they are normal pictures like erdogan&#39;s and another image of a giant banner for his election campaign, and so if the images were selected more accurately, it would be an excellent thing. part two: the party&#39;s program. worth five stars. the least described program as a program of understanding people. the program is based on a thorough study of the conditions and conditions of turkish society, its capabilities and the resources available to it. a program made specifically to suit turkey with its values, civilizational assets and available resources. until you find that, for example, in talking about livestock, it identifies the best places for you to develop livestock. part of fundamental rights and freedoms is one of the best approaches i&#39;ve seen, especially in its relevance to a country of a complex nature such as turkey. the state is very secular, secular and loyal to ataturk&#39;s policy, and the party is a party that draws its ideas from the correct islamic approach and with a flimsy party policy, especially with the repetition of military coups, it becomes clear to us how bad the situation is, what did the founders of the party ?? they resorted to defining and defining concepts, especially with the relativity of political concepts, and created a marriage between the secularism of the state and the islamism of the party in a wonderful political system. see in the program it. we see religion as one of the most important components of humanity and secularism as a necessary thing for democracy, with an emphasis on freedom of religion and belief and we refuse to distort secularism by making it in hostility with religion .. secularism is a principle that allows everyone regardless of their religion and their belief in:. freely practice their beliefs. express their convictions the way they want to live. at the same time, secularism gives those who do not owe a debt mainly the right to organize matters of their lives consistent with this trend .. and when he spoke about the policy to which they seek they said about it. politics is the will of society to build a present in accordance with sound rules and foundations and to carefully plan its future. there is a lot and a lot in the party’s program, but it must be emphasized that the only benefit in my opinion from this program is specialization. each country has its own principles, values, and available resources that can be exploited. each country must have its own experience of being affected by other experiences, not by blind transportation or application

lightly bird whisk and open aura wing. the openness of the transit air was lightly open, and the starting air did not pass .. they passed quickly, as a moment of diminution .. they had a voice from the sparrow, from a branch, a look, from a blossoming shamim .. their birds were singing and leaving, not to be imprisoned in cages or paved in mummified facades. their birds are the traveling soul, not the feathered resident .. and their fragrant fragrant flowers outside the pot ... other than the traveling, the indifferent, the tampering with the residence, the possessed, and the dead, who would have discovered the beauty of crossing? and what moment does life discover more than the moment of its absence? is it necessary for the leave to be authenticated more than the residence permit? and, therefore, should our life be just an exercise in the beauty of leaving? the most beautiful of the departed. the most beautiful suicide. those who did not want anything and did not take anything. those who took one step in the river were enough to discover the waters ... the most beautiful of us who are not among us. those who left us are light, leaving modestly, their seats for people who may come now, to this party ... a silly party, and yet the tenants do not leave the seat. but why not seats, as long as the celebrities start guests and end enemies? let us go, then, lightly, before the daggers swallow us up, before we make the banquet dish .. the moment of reaching the celebration is the beauty of the celebration. and then, soon, the beauty becomes the departure. the departure step is always the most beautiful .. the departed people mix the breeze. as we stand to make funeral for them, let us commemorate their memory also. because memory hinders their departure, brings them back to their place, makes them inanimate ... memory hinders those who wish to die. and make those who want to live dead .. let us bury it then .. to bury the memory while we sing .. it is a silly party in any case, but since we have arrived, let us sing and dance .. seconds, we may be beautiful .. but the most beautiful will remain: the absent .. thank you oh wonderful, i will make sure to read the rest of your work. and scheduling them within my plans

"championship, motivation and the main driver of events are the revolutionary idea and situation and the desire to make a fundamental change in society, not people. the idea that dostoevsky clearly declares his wish to change and rebel for a better life is why people give such great attention to others&#39; opinions about them, that they control their lives and are considered their weak point and through which they can easily control them with the remote control. the analysis is still waiting for me to have the opportunity to give him the right to write in detail, perhaps after finishing the second part. when i had the opportunity to complete what i started, i found that the supplement was required:. you are confused as you approach the end of this chapter in the classification of characters .. from a good and a wicked person in particular nikolai staffogen .. he and his friend peter are very complex and very complex personalities that curse them sometimes sympathize with them and seek excuse for them. in the end, you really find yourself wondering: will i know at the end of the novel who the demons are, and whether they include the father and teacher stephen trovimovich .. he is the other who seems to suffer from diseases of selfishness, negativity and inaction, the inability to resolve any issue or make any decision .. these characters are considered to be rejected characters in societies preparing for a fundamental social change in them, where the negative intellectual is hated and undesirable .. it does not provide, but delay. one of the most wonderful dialogues in the novel is stephen&#39;s dialogue with varvara petrovna, as she attacked him violently, accusing him of wanting to exclusively acquire knowledge, and in return, he despises others on the pretext that he is more knowledgeable .. he is stingy with his knowledge so he is responsible for what they reached and directly to. rather, we find that he himself is frank with himself and reveals it in front of his friend, the narrator, and admits that he is like a capricious child, who has many freaks, and he says: you have put your finger, my friend, on a painful sore point, and that the friendly fingers are cruel, merciless, but lack civility. sometimes i think of this woman, farvara petrovna, who has reached that whole amount of generosity, tolerance and patience towards my bad faults, the truth is that she is not a lot of patience. but is it permissible for me to complain about the bad nature of myself, who i likened to the child in extreme selfishness without having the innocence of the child ?? as usual, in light of societal developments, we find that there is no dialogue between the heroes of any revolutionary movement that is free of these sentences that bounce by rebelling against the frozen ideas that the clerics boil in order to control the poor of society and compel them with religious authority to accept the class differences and the abhorrent reality to them, this sentence came to stefan trofimovich:. the more painful a difficult life for a person, and the more miserable persecuted people are, the more persistent the dreams of rewards that they will receive in paradise. and of course, you do not find a society devoid of the likes of leputin the chatter, the gossip that does not stop rhythm among some friends to control them and know their weaknesses and influence them through them ... and we find that this is what ibn stephan excelled in controlling the wife of the ruler, which is what we will find in the second part the conflict rages, and the ends begin to take clear paths

"wonderful book, including the meanings of the letters. very light despite the amount of information presented in it and its ease of absorption, especially for those who are not inclined to books on philosophy and religions. the author got off to a strong start with those heavy questions in the eyes of those who are ignorant of it and simple in view of those who worked hard to know the details of our religion, islam. so the difference between islam and other religions is thank god that i was aware of the answer in advance, if somewhat shallow. hence, the story of the search started with ben atheism, christ, gentiles and others. i learned many things that i went through daily and i never thought of them as the names of the gods and their meanings. and how it has become the names of famous landmarks, brands and others. also, i always wondered why they worshiped the buddha to this degree. ignorance reached them, so the writer explained the story of the buddha, why did people start worshiping him, etc. in addition, i liked his dialogue with foreigners, and his attempt to lure them without fanaticism, leaving them with a chance to think without pressure. in particular, his conversation with the woman, and how verses from surat al-nisaa misinterpreted what is apparent before her and not in the hidden sense. here lies the miracles of the qur’an, and we do not learn from the qur’an from the first reading and the first thought, but it needs care, attention and effort to take all the benefits from it, so let the qur’an be the spring of our hearts. as for his visit to the church, my curiosity has increased around me for as long as i wanted to explore it from the inside and i am trying to enter into dialogue with them, except my fear prevents me and the poverty of information brings me back steps back. in a chapter, a soul, and their pastors, he spoke about human personalities and their types inferred from the holy qur’an, and he impressed me. the book as a whole is very useful, showing the writer&#39;s eagerness to deliver information in a simple and clear way despite the diversity of information. he did not hesitate to put evidence from all religions. there is a quote that i like the quotation of german physicist werner heisenberg. you will likely become an atheist when you drink from the cup of knowledge, but be absolutely certain that you will find god awaiting you at the end of the cup

"a book that starts from scratch with jihad operations in saudi arabia, the author divides jihad into two classical jihad, which generally represents a speech in chechnya and the global jihad that represents bin laden, the author studies how to start jihad in afghanistan and how the saudi government was supporting the mujahideen and receiving them as heroes. then how the repression that happened to the awakening in general and the jihadists in particular in the mid-nineties what made many after their release tend to al qaeda and the global jihad that many were not convinced before this suppression because it causes a lot of controversy unlike the classic jihad that comfort the saudi mind more since it is an aggression against an infidel gas in chechnya, for example, the author progresses with history down to the september events that caused al-qaeda to direct its operations into saudi arabia after the fall of the taliban in kabul, and how the dispute between al-zawahiri and bin laden was against al-eiri, who saw the inappropriate time to launch an attack inside the kingdom, but bin laden’s insistence and launching suicide attacks gradually weakened al-qaeda to that almost ended. there is a lot also that the author on chechnya, bosnia and other sub-fronts touched upon, if you will .. in my view, the book is very excellent for those who wanted to understand that stage. the author studies the stage in a largely neutral and rational manner, and the translator i see is according to the currency simply language.

"i started reading the blue elephant and in my vertigo memory that i did not find different from the cheap teenage stories, linguistically weak and naive in building events. the beginning of the blue elephant gave me a temporary negative impression, from rhetorical expressions that are sometimes lenient and smoldering, but it started to dwindle with the progress of the pages of the novel, and it really impressed me with innovative analogies that are not like the absurd vertigo similes, until they shine artistically and stylist as we near the end. i still have to point out a few minor negatives: / contradiction: the page of an honest wound on the left hand, a page on the right .. / some english phrases have errors, which may be typographical .. / confusion between the vocabulary of the leg and the leg, the humerus and the forearm .. / excessive use of impulses, intimidation, impulse ... etc. wrong use, and stylistically monotonous .. / combining wheat from the flesh of simile, it looked like someone feeds a gold ring with stones from zalat .. the writer&#39;s style evolved a lot from his first novel, and his rhetorical skills were evident, but they needed linguistic refinement. he had mentioned at the signing ceremony of the novel his reading of the book of jurisprudence al-thaalabi, and he meant the jurisprudence of language and it is a small heritage book, despite its importance does not fit our time. the first is that the dictionaries of error and linguistic correctness, the best of which are written by dr. ahmad mukhtar omar .. finally, i see that we have discovered a novelist promising the best always in what will be written.

"this book is a natural psychological epic close to the nature of the female .. the loss is the most difficult and the most bitter of feelings at all. as for the deceased is the son and the tragedy is death, and behind this love there is a great sense of guilt, powerlessness, emotional emptiness and a solid life without any excitement. or even softness, here writing is nothing but a severe bleeding of memory .... frankly for the first time i read a novel belonging to a gulf novelist i do not insult in his letters grumbling about the life of reservation imposed on the gulf .... and if the opinion of some is a novel that leads to depression and its shipments are distributed in space .. so the one who forgives the novelist is that after she sailed to the reader in the world so, after i sincerely bothered him with the size of her grief and sadness, i wrapped him with a page number that somehow orchestrated the chanting of a happy song and broadcast it in the air .... it was a wonderful novel.

"this is a book against the narrow, exclusive, puritan and simplistic concept that reduces the full identity to a single affiliation advocated angrily. against the widespread, very malicious and very dangerous way of thinking that diminishes identity because it puts men in a prejudiced, sectarian, fanatic, authoritarian, and sometimes suicidal position and turns them often into killers or supporters of murderers. amin maalouf calls instead to imagine our identity as being made up of multiple affiliations so once we see in ourselves and in our origins various, accurate, and contradictory intersections, contributions, hybrids and influences until we have a different relationship with others. amin maalouf believes that we often exaggerate the impact of religions on peoples, while neglecting the opposite of the influence of peoples on religions and criticizes the widespread opinion in the west, which easily sees in islam the source of all the evils suffered by the societies that belong to it .. and believes that there is no point in asking what it says the truth of islam, christianity or marxism if we seek answers and not merely to affirm negative or positive prejudices, then we should not be entrusted with the essence of belief but rather with the actions of those who have been relying on it throughout history. and he says elsewhere, the twentieth century taught us that there is no liberating doctrine in itself, all beliefs can be deflected, and all can be honed and all their hands are stained with the blood of communism, liberalism and nationalism and all of the major religions and even secularism no one monopolizes intolerance and vice versa no one monopolizes what is humanitarian . finally, the wish made by amin maalouf at the end of his book seems very far away, or almost impossible, at least for our time.

"ordinary or self-track as i like to call it. the author, dr. mostafa seif presented. his hero aamir, who represents every human being in us, and who did not get imran himself except in the midst of the greater wandering. we are all aamir who used to beat the liver of the earth to ask for gold, but he was searching for his absent heart in its hollow. he was hitting the earth without mercy, crucifying himself as we were together. gold is in the heart of fallow, and by it he finds light in himself, even after a while .. the writer moved in flexibility and smoothness to the fluctuations of the different soul by its delinquency by obedience to it and presented in strength to that genie that we fear collectively and is facing ourselves presented this through easy and sound language and the idea of the novel is very strong and passion is overwhelming and the narration distinctive and filled with genius phrases and phrases close to oneself and informed what is in it is that it will touch a part of every human soul and present images of those distant depths, and the end is distinguished by being appropriate and attractive, as each soul ends with an end that fits with what it is filled with .. it will remain the truest author of what the author wrote, but dr. mustafa&#39;s writings are characterized by a strong sense and symbolism characterized by two things . first, it respects the reader&#39;s mindset and makes him think a lot. symbolism is a color of writing that requires the realization of the mind. second, it makes him leave his imagination unleashed, envisioned, and thinks in his own way. ten people find each of them imagining his own connotations and his own point of view. .. and the author possesses that character that makes you realize his writings from all the colors of writing, and the ordinary will not be his creativity. the best is that it is only a beginning ... personally, i learned from it that the end is not achieved until when we have made the last of our love as happiness or the last of what we have from the purity of ali or another of our greed and greed as a whole who seeks money a and what we have to seek to know god as the end of amer. and every soul has great luck with what you have been filled with, so beware yourselves .. the novel is beautiful and good luck, doctor

"in this book, shereen proceeds to recite her autobiography but in a light, beautiful and interesting way, as if she reads a story, and she did not limit the topic to herself but rather spoke about iran from a legal and social angle, she listed the most important changes that iranian society experienced from the era of the shah until the era shiite rule, and how the life of the iranian individual changed and how the iranian people struggled to change for the better .. it was an interesting reading, even if i had some drawbacks .. i recommend it

"as usual every period, i went to the jarir bookstore to see the new books and acquire some of them, in renewal of thought, reason and soul as well. i immediately refrained from many books and refrained from acquiring many of them for several reasons that were established after many visits to these commercial libraries: what is permanently observed in it is the abundance of nausea and absurdity in the arab cultural product, from publications and books. it is, in addition to its small and weak percentage compared to european and american countries, this little is dominated by collection, tradition, copying and banality .. the price of prices is not tolerated by the largest percentage of shoppers and even class members. medium compared to an average sized book is not worth all that high amount. the internet has enriched many books such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, books of information and the like, there is no need to purchase these books and spend huge amounts of money on it, and there is something that sings them in electronic ways easier .. having a long row of books awaiting reading in my library and my home, there is no need to multiply from other books, but just a simple update and additions here and there ... i finished a medium-length tour of the library with four books. i was surprised at the accountant that they were all novels unintentionally, although i do not care much about them, but i balance them with many other cultural and intellectual books .. i returned home i went to the ground and put the narrators around the four and a computer open to technical subjects, i imagined that the owners of these accounts and those technical subjects were sitting around me in a unique episode, as if most of them were dead cultural preparation session. yahya hakki and i were with his novel qandil umm hashem ... with us taha hussein and his novel al-ayyam .. there is a neighborhood between the living and it is amin maalouf and his african novels lyon. then the late naguib mahfouz and some of his chatter over the nile .. and to qusay&#39;s corner there has been since anis mansour and his days came in the akkad salon, but i did not join him in that unique session. and me with him a bitter pause later. in a heterogeneous manner, bill gates and a lengthy technical material were with us, a study from me for one of the endless microsoft technical certificates .. i was confused about where to start and what i commend and who i will triple to him but the opinion settled from the subconscious of the wonderful late yahya hakki and his unique qandil or hashem in which he made his reputation as a work of the most important works of the short or slightly long story in the twentieth century .. we are here talking about a story written since the forties of the last century and you have always heard about it and read a lot of praise and praise in the books and cultural and literary circulation circulated, and perhaps the most important of those singled out in criticism in that time with a wonderful article is al adi by the martyr syed qutb, may god have mercy on him, then added to his valuable book: books and characters. until the beginning of this article, it will captivate you and inform you that a flood of praise will spell out this story and this fictional creativity. when sayyid qutb opens this article to:. oh yahya hakki ... where are you, man ... i wish i had the executioner&#39;s whip, lazy creator. . syed continues to list my talents and creativity and compare them to timur and others .. when he mentions that my right is less productive compared to others, but it is distinguished by type, quality, and talent in this little .. as for timur, for example, he writes, writes and writes, and he must come across a good thing in this much that he writes. i also remember what the late scholar mahmoud shaker abu fahr wrote in his valuable book, false and asmar about that humble man who visited him one day for the first time in his house with a writer and then contacted him later asking him for permission to be his friend and to visit him continuously that was the humble man adeeb yahya my right, since they have become close friends since then, and some sources attribute the professorship to shaker and the apprentice to my right to death, may god have mercy on her in the last decade of the twentieth century .. so all these introductions that i have read, heard and seen about yahya hakki and qandil or hashem made something inside of me great about this writer and his production so maybe p some think that i have made the issue of ruling on it, and it is an easy issue, and it has a look and a blurring upon it. however, really despite all that, i was missing a lot, many, and not the inspector like the informant and anyone who tasted the custom. every wonderful description about qandil or hashem and the smoothness and aesthetics of the language and style of yahya hakki al-qasasi does not all enrich that description from the moments of his reading and taste. for the first time, i read a story on many of my reading of this literary genre with this wonderful language, the smoothness of words and the splendor of the method that penetrates into the souls of the soul and does its act, for when you read to revive my right and specifically qandil or hashem, it is as if you drink water, or sip honey with its ingenuity in language love and draw pictures with ease and elegance verbal grace .. qandeel umm hashem’s story revolves around that young ismail, whose rate does not qualify him for admission to local egyptian colleges, and his father decides to send him abroad in britain in order to complete his studies and return to a doctor that the family is proud of despite the hardships of distance, separation and financial pressure on the family because of this only with distress .. that villager turns to another man in britain who bites, befriends, breaks, and also succeeds in his studies and returns to an ophthalmologist, but he is a doctor who revolts against customs, traditions, sophistication, and amulets, defying and praising against the current trend to dare and carry his stick and smash a lamp hashim, that lamp suspended over the shrine of the lady takes the poor from its oil to treat their patients with all their diseases and offer gifts and gifts to him .. the result was that the simple people of the neighborhood revolted against him and beat him until he nearly died to be rescued by his former colleague, the guard of the mausoleum and his shepherd .. the young doctor then decides to treat his fiancée, the ruminants in her eyes with his modern form, in which he has recovered dozens in a britain. but her condition gets worse day by day until she almost lost sight .. in the end the young man reaches the stage of reconciliation between his youth and his traditions and returns to visit the shrine .. the shrine of the lady is not dispensed with his modern treatment .. this is the story in short, which will not make you need to read it of course, but the last sentence, perhaps, summarizing the whole idea of the story, which is dealing with crises of interaction between east and west. between the backward east that has just looked for the glamor of western civilization. between the sight of the west and the insight of the east. between the mind of the first world, and the spirit of the third world. between decades and centuries of eastern backwardness and delay, and recent years of superiority and terrible western scientific progress .. this was the preoccupation of intellectuals and writers of preoccupation in the half of the twentieth century with the era of colonialism and the end of its end, so people were three types :. a class that satisfied the west with its advantages and disadvantages and decided to merge with it and completely strip it of its identity .. it classified completely closed to itself and closed the windows with many arguments until those withered and died .. and an intermediate class between this and that closed the doors as it all opened the windows and received the new with its advantages and disadvantages ... perhaps this is the last class it is what yahya hakki, may god have mercy on him, tried to display and address through the story of this rebellious and confused young man between his traditions and his society who was looking at him with contempt and disgust and then reconciled and appreciated after that after he realized that there is no mind for the west without a soul for the east .. is this conflict over? i do not think so, and still we are witnessing many civilized traumas who first went to the homes of the west, its universities and institutes to send his speeches from there despising its societies, universities, students, and curricula ... not reconcilable neither with himself nor with his family repeating the same mistakes and negatives. may not benefit his community, even in the end, what he learned and studied. he benefited himself .. quotes. yahya hakki formulates and casts all of this with unparalleled linguistic creativity and intellectual creativity. look at him describing ismail&#39;s arrival in the steamship to alexandria after he finished his studies: why did the ships deliberately make this reluctance to reach, and what was the fastest in separation? anyone who takes refuge in the arboretum remains a captive of his life. he describes him as britain and described his girlfriend mary: the acquaintance has a collision between the two characters, which comes out victorious or loser, the acquaintance has a meeting, and the friendliness is up to the future. he who seeks the morals of angels is overcome by the morals of beasts. these eastern emotions are vicious and hated because they are impractical and unproductive, and if they are stripped of benefit, there remains nothing but their weakness and humiliation. rather, these emotions have strength in secrecy, not in disclosure. the human soul does not find its strength and then its happiness unless it separates from the masses and confronts them. as for integration, it is weak and resentful. here, it describes the poor people, and perhaps it describes all the arab peoples: what is the benefit of jihad in a country like egypt and with a people like the egyptians, who have lived in humiliation for centuries, so taste and taste it? this is an old people and returned to their childhood, if someone found it to lead to jumping into manhood again in one step, the road is familiar and glory is old and memories remain. the lover does not measure or compare, and if the comparison is entered from the door and the love passes through the window, here he describes how ismail reached the stage of conciliation and reconciliation with himself and his community: where are you, o light that i have been absent forever? welcome to you, the blurring of my heart and eyes was gone. i now understood what was hidden from me .. there is no knowledge without faith. he stuck to his knowledge of his spirit and foundation, and left exaggeration in machines and means. he relied on god, then on his knowledge and hands, so god blessed his knowledge and hands. there is not everything in you and me ... there is beauty, secrets, fun and splendor. al-saeed is one of her feelings. then you have to. between the migration season and the jellyfish. perhaps yahya hakki, son of that lane, did not intend to return to bless those shrines and their oils, but he wanted to convey the idea of reconciling the science with faith, the science of the west with the faith of the east, and he ended it with a happy, bright ending .. here comes to our minds the story of the migration season to the north by tayeb saleh. it deals with the same idea and revolves its contexts on the same topic and the same way with that of the young man leaving the sudanese village submerged to britain to study literature to return after the same period of years in qandil or hashem and events continue .. but the end of the season

"four dialogues for which plato socrates specializes, the dialogues in their entirety are wonderful, evoke the mind and urge him to think, research and ask, all dialogues begin with introductions on the tongue of socrates and end with either negative results to criticize one of the misconceptions from socrates ’point of view, especially plato or positive to support an idea they believe in .. why not i like in the introductions that the repeated delivery is very much in the responses of those who are interviewed by socrates, which appears in the repetition of a group of vocalizations. examples are yes, it is correct, i think you are right, socrates, there is no disagreement, no doubt, certainty, no doubt about that, very true, yes this what i might imagine and other amusing signs the full introductions that socrates proposes and in my imagination if there was some objection to these introductions with logical opinions as is the style of socrates, the outcome of the dialogues could have been much richer, with the exception of some responses from simias and sebaceus in the phaedo dialogue, so they had some objections that contributed to enriching those the interview a lot .. there are also introductions that the translator, clever naguib mahmoud recounted for each interview separately. i think that it is better to have subsequent comments for each conversation in order not to lose on the reader the pleasure of the dialogs themselves .. the etofron interview most of its results are negative to criticize certain ideas about piety and i would have preferred to have the result of any abate to define piety in the eyes of socrates and plato .. the defense dialogue is better to call it pleading and not the dialogue because socrates dwells on it in defense of itself, and there was no dialogue except in the narrowest limits ... the dialogue of the qataris i liked and disagreed with on one side only when i imagine the laws and blame him for he escaped the death sentence in a hypothetical dialogue in which the laws accused him of treason because he was satisfied with them and accepted them even if he was sentenced after that to flee from their rule, and the essence of my difference here is that he does not flee from them or from their rule, but if he had accepted fleeing then he escapes from the injustice of the applicable law and not from them, how many valid laws are fulfilled dam from the misuse of its implementers, because the effect of socrates escaping at the time did not involve him from betraying the laws in anything, and this is my opinion. the last dialogue, which is the discussion of fidon, is the most beloved and most interesting one to myself. plato in it, on the tongue of socrates, excelled in proving the immortality of the soul. new, and thus, the one soul rotates over several bodies in many times, and the idea of learning and knowledge in its reality is nothing but a reminder of what the soul has acquired in its first world and in the lower world, it is a truly inspiring idea that made me wonder about what kind of spirit inhabited me who was in the past, and made me also imagine that spirits it is only a very limited number that alternates and regenerates in the bodies in an endless cycle, and the dialogue also raised the idea of succession of opposites that plato believed a lot. in the end the book is creamy and worth reading again

"it seems to me from reading the other comments that i am. i did not notice the dimensions of the plot. as others understood it, it seems to me that some did not pick up the primary goal that mitchell tried to reach .... i will try to clarify this point and what i understand from the book, then i will talk about my impression of the book .. i will start with what i understood; the book basically talks about the philosophy of colonial rule, neither the history of colonial events nor its final outcome, and for this reason the author spoke in the introduction about the philosophies of jacques derrida and michel vaucault in. this philosophy is based on two principles: the first is a high degree of representation, that is, the use of signs on meanings that are not physically present, for example, the organization of the new european-style neighborhoods in cairo and rabat was a symbol of the existence of a precise system, different and separate from the buildings and streets it is the article of the organization itself, and the old neighborhoods have been preserved to symbolize the lack of order, in contrast with the new neighborhoods .. the second basis: it is the principle of permanent control, that everyone be under observation, without the observation authority being observed or visible. what i see and understand is that these two principles are part of modern systems of government in general, so the introduction of new army systems and forced recruitment the one who started with muhammad ali was not a conspiracy but a transfer of the prevailing systems in europe, as well as education systems and the architecture of cities and villages, and the brutality with which this matter was made was part of this, perhaps forced labor during the era of muhammad ali and ibrahim his son ziada and diligence from them .. this is not a justification for these methods in any way, but an attempt to understand the reason behind it, and muhammad ali and the workers of tawfik and the british attempt to transform egypt to serve its economy were motivated by this approach, so their solution was to transfer the european systems of government with its philosophy .. follow this of course attempts to change culture, religion, language, and literature, bad faith cannot be excluded from it, and those who rise up to address this these are attempts, including mustafa kamel, who attacked qasim amin in the matter of women&#39;s emancipation, despite his conviction of some of the principles of this system, as it appeared in his talk about methods of education .. attempting to implement this philosophy of government in our country led to the emergence of this collision, so the writer applied the theories of derrida to clarify the weakness of this philosophy .. this is what i understood from the writer&#39;s intent, and the damage that occurred to egypt was not only due to the application of this system, except for the impact of the same on western countries. the system of oppression that we suffer now is partly the result of this philosophy, but the main reason is the fact that the military and the rest of the state in general agree on corruption and injustice, as if it is a religion that has ... as for my impression of the book, it is difficult to define it. the book raised more questions in my mind than answers, and it is a commendable point in it, especially since these questions converged with other questions that i was thinking about the nature of these regulations. two shortcomings i took on this edition and the book: despite the quality of the translation to some extent, i found some spelling errors and punctuation, especially in the recent chapters .. some parts of the book could have been presented in an easier language.

"it is unfortunate that the enemies of islam know its ability and the muslims do not know it. they knew from the beginning of the call that islam is an invasive religion of its nature that is rejected only by those with souls, it is a religion consistent with the pure common sense that broke the right and did not contaminate the disease of arrogance .. it is a religion that addresses the human mind and appreciates and respects it. and he seeks the supremacy of the human spirit, which always seeks to find something metaphysical related to it in order to fill the void within it, as he does not distance himself from the fools of jews and christians who own nothing of their religion except to convince his adherents that they only have to believe in crucifixion and salvation, otherwise there is no there something about peace, s blood for man is a complete system of religion and world, and it always pushes man to ask and research not only to believe in what is said without realizing his mind .. hence, conspiracies have been woven for him from the first moment in which he commanded his prophet to crack what he commanded and warn his close clan, since the war was fierce ever since. now and for more than a year, we have witnessed that the war is not over since the invasion of badr, and through the wars of apostasy, and what the old and modern crusades are about us far away ... but from what the foreheads claim is that the war began to take another more serious curve, rather than if we were in the past fighting people who did not belong to me our religion, and not to our race, are today fighting those who are sons our skin speaks in our tongues and they condemn our religion, but they are a dagger in the back of islam. there is no doubt that those who sold themselves to the crusader and judaic ambitions brought about i do not say in islam, but in the muslims of defeats what the enemies of islam failed to do for centuries, so we had to face these and our war with them before our battle began with others, the class must first be cleansed before the battle begins ... and the question that is always repeated remains for this hatred of another ???. the answer is no, as these people realize that it is a battle, and the end result is that only one must win. when do we realize that ?????

"after reading a novel, i knew how to master the writing of the novel by mixing the literary and political styles together at the hands of the english writer george orwell .. a novel that diverges in the depth of advanced societies, rooted in it and in its dictatorial system with an exciting constitutional constitutional template, was able to predict the future future of peoples, the matter what distinguished her among the world’s political novels .. and if orwell’s writing was not an interesting fun, i would not have fled to his other narrative, which is rich in definition, animal farm, because i am not one of those who really love political topics. it is a masterpiece in its own right that does not look like other .. animal farm. in the content:. those who read orwell&#39;s biography and his clear political positions understand exactly as he submits himself that this novel has its satirical purpose, mocking communism and the stalinist regime that ruined the concept of socialism, in orwell&#39;s opinion. orwell, who fought stalin in the atmosphere of world war ii, came to describe this situation with a story, let me say, everyone can read and fully absorb it .. a farm that varies in its animals from pigs, dogs, horses, ducks, chickens, etc...the owner of the human is jones she succeeds in draining it away from the farm, to take control of her own leadership. between the pig snowball and the other napoleon, there are disagreements over the leadership of the farm and its affairs, so the turning point in the story takes place, where napoleon can defeat snowball in a violent fight when he feels the latter is victorious over him. this battle was the beginning of napoleon&#39;s presidency of the farm, which orwell symbolized stalin as many critics analyzed .. the farm affairs develop, seven commandments are laid down as laws for them, some battles occur with other farms, all of this until we reach the paper end only, where it explains in short, the revolutionary who once revolted in the name of justice turned into a monster that does not differ from the human race by anything, as there is no difference between what is seen between a pig and a human being ... the end of what we are still under its weight ... it is true that it is by its events and personalities, where the explanation goes on, symbolizes what was before during and after the stalinist era, as orwell raged, it was only suitable for any society to be described as a human being. a distinct from hiwanath ... only feet-two method:. when you read this novel, you come back like a child who loves token stories. symbolism is a key element of this novel, which, if it lacks some narrative elements, is but it revolves around a certain historical era that was intelligently shaped by orwell, on a farm of animals. it goes beyond being a short story, with its mark and sarcasm, to a hybrid world, in which the donkey obeys and does not speak to any defeated person, the loyal horse who works hard without knowing what is happening, the protected dog that represents the police of power, and the pig itself i.e. the power made by the people she pounced on him in the name of freedom ... a favorite.

"an exciting novel, as usual, ala al-aswany .. i did not miss a moment while i was reading it. it is not a pure historical novel ... even though this was my belief when i heard about the historical period about which you are talking. honestly ... i do not think it takes him five years, according to what is written behind .. although the people you are talking about are theoretically impossible to answer any documented information they were living with what and not the details of their lives with the magnificence that dr. / alaa wrote. the narrative plot was weaker than the previous two novels, the architecture of jacobian and chicago ... i had imagined that all people would relate to more than that on the last novel, as he did with an unparalleled genius in chicago. i could have said that the dose of sex was in excess of the need ... but no ... sincere ... for me this is a normal thing ... without hypocrisy and frankly sex and especially stayed in egypt is actually events and represents a part and a terrible factor in the lives of the egyptians. however, he stated in the novel that he provided the dose of enjoying the novel and its events and let the one read it, and he is amused especially that many of it are related to the cam of qafsheya and a special story when i come to aisha&#39;s biography ... however, alaa al-aswany thought he was intentional and basically he was speaking on him again, we will also speak on it, as well as a line .. this was generally more polite and less shocking than the previous two novels ... especially, and we know that this period was a period in which this talk will happen .. this is not a period far away from us in time, which gives it a separation from us in a way ... as if we are watching the things that happen, not part of the written reality. the genius of the novel in two needs:. the first thing is to choose the main topic and heroes. this novel talks about the invisible people ... as one of us when he was watching the images of faruq and not the era in general, he focused on the image of the aswan man and not the nubian who stands to serve the people de ... we are all attributed and commented on the distinction of faruq. .. the beauty of the princesses ... the confusion ... the personalities and relationships ... the sessions ... the decoration even and the inanimate objects were more important to us than we do not see them as countries ... even though the countries of our ancestors and our relatives ... the countries of the true egyptians .. countries of most of the egyptian people ... countries of scavengers and delivery workers who are sitting on the coffees day and night and those who are confident in the lines of living and the good children who are in the college i did not marginalize the owners and put them on, it is not like that ....... the people who do not appear under the sun ... the people who live in the faces of the walls ... the people who feel them are not in society ... the murlock who spoke to wales in a wonderful machine time. these people are the mainstay of any society ... the people who do not struggle to fear and know them will find another world ... all are vital, honesty, worries and feelings .. a real world where real people live, not fake with little money, parties, shows, and arab and brides have a game and a little zombie, they move and act like a place ... the world that metsi knew of his interference and was amazed by it and decided that she sacrifices everything needed so that it remains one of him despite the external form that asphalt. he concluded, but the novel and a very hard copy of the image that was righteous ... which i think you did not focus on in the first place when i came to buy the novel .. or it can be felt that it is a picture of a closed or not this way .... countries of the protagonists .. countries that strike each day in the end, if you mistake it or not, it is wrong, for justice, and i hope that they will not be like the mind of the people ... the countries that exist are not living. those living are not living ... insects who respond from all of egypt to suck their blood, and when they die, they are in a million others. ... the people who didn’t hope ... the six envisioned countries are abdoun, hassanein, karara, bahr, abdel aziz, mahmoud, samahi and others ... who we did not like we see them other than when dr. alaa and rana people are really in this novel. the second point: this is a strange perspective about the novel, and i will read it to me. man is by nature a primitive being ... instinctively ... originally like any animal ... originally instincts are the primary motive in animals ... and this is not an insult ... this is a fact ... instincts are a grain of hormones that are excreted in us, as they do not excrete at any an animal ... lust, fear, hunger, and thirst ... it is true that the difference is that i have a mind of mind: whoever restrains the animal being led and our case is intended instincts and costly and free because this is the length of history in a cultural and moral class that is ours we will avoid this with our instincts, because we do not discuss animals ... a class that remains to be formed with our experiences ... with the collective mentality of human beings over time ... from religions and literature and he sees it ... it is the class that we work with people ... i can&#39;t tell a mask that in fact it is not a mask ... this is supposed to be left with us being a human being and a human being ... it is the layer that we say we are supposed to do what we do and what we do in situations .. is what determines our behavior based on our social position, etc. but no matter how thick the layer is, this is the atmosphere for each one of us ... except that our subconscious mind is not a penny, it is the origin in us, it is a grain of chemicals, our life, we will not be able to get rid of it, no matter how much we try, and no matter how sophisticated ... ... whether with all rudeness, like what they are doing. they used to work with mahmoud and fawzi in the novel, and like what i did not work, he did not work with the girls who slept with them ... whether by finding justifications like what he worked with. tipping back. whether in circumstances that pass by our superiority ... like what was full and abdoun hours they spent with the koo and mister wright in every call, although this was not what anyone imagined. i was asked by real feelings of contradicting custom, which people settled on, like the opinions of the egyptians, and the love of metsi for the whole .... and this was what i was talking about, that the sex in the novel was employed from this perspective ... i know you are just any good community .. you will find the richest and most aristocratic classes by interfering and interacting with the lowest class in society with the image of your age what you imagined .. and what more picture will shock you other than sex, alaa can explain it in the story .... instincts are a main engine in people&#39;s behavior ... interactions and results the one who appears on her with the strangest aspiration of the results of changing the course of any nation .. think of burning my dear to himself and not what, except for hitler, remains hitler .. q i was talking about er. in the end ... the automobile club is not better than the yaqoubian building and not chicago ... my relationship with it is not so much because it happened in a relatively long period ... the political projection if it means means to the one with a tiger there is not clear to me ... people are not drawn like i did not get used to alaa al-aswany ... but in general i enjoyed her very much. and oh right ... the first thing in the first place is that the characters of the novel are out of it ... and karl benz&#39;s time is not surprising. i can say that karl benz’s time appears to be an important part of the novel, which is that the six are always a key driver in any event .. either by her will or whether by attracting the man to her, she has the same idea of instincts as brdo, and that this changes the course of any need ... but if it really meant it ... the novel remains a major aspect of its focus on one subject ... the point where writings are written and a complete literary aspect is adopted on it and a flaw originally comes as a sub-topic in a novel. the first part is for science fiction. i forgot to talk about it originally from the many pieces of what is strange and separate from the novel .. i do not know he was trying out a new need or what

"certainly charming if you want a very special holiday, book here quickly before you retire from the hard-working christa in order to get the rest you really deserve. it will warmly welcome you, give you complete personal care, fulfill all your requests and provide you with any information you want about this extraordinary island. accomodation in the magnificent, distinctive caves is first class: comfortable beds, well-equipped kitchen and shower room. everything has great touches, and the cleanliness is a skilled maid who comes every day to change the covers and clean carefully. the best time is when sitting on the balcony amid beautifully cared for flowers, looking at the amazing volcanic landmark and watching the cliffs change to pink as the sun sets. in fact it is so special that you may leave the beach early to return to the charm of your balcony. there are hundreds of steps down stairs and then going up again, and breakfast is not served with such a good kitchen, who would need it? there is no swimming pool with the aegean sea that surrounds you, who needs it too. if any of these matters cause you, you will not be able to enjoy the magic of ares caves. but you will be the loser. additional tip: you will be encouraged to take a trip to the local volcano. the boat trip around the volcanic landmark is wonderful, but the volcano itself is a disappointment. you have to take a steep path for half an hour in the heat, and then search for some brown stones. there is no swimming pool with steam bubbles, not even any trace of smoke. you have to wait for iceland or new zealand to arrive

"beautiful views of the nile we stayed here in our second week in june after we sailed the first week in the nile, so we wanted a place not far from the resort so we do not have to wander away and this hotel was independent in itself so it was perfect because it contains three or four restaurants in the place to choose from among them, and the facilities are expected to be three-star. the hotel enjoys a great location directly overlooking the nile, where many falconry trips sail from the other side, and we can also see hot air balloons springing on the horizon; these two scenes are beautiful scenery alike. we were lucky enough to be moved to rooms overlooking the nile that were a bonus ... although i never imagined that the rooms overlooking the pool would be so beautiful. everything in the hotel was clean and comfortable, but i am obliged to provide a negative comment about the staff of the guards in the main restaurant ... many of them were rude and rude and did not serve you well unless i gave them a good tip on a daily basis, but in general it is a good hotel.

"of the novels that dazzle you, arouse your enthusiasm, and thinks that it is the best that you have read, but once you close it and with only one day passing by reading it you forget .. but few are the stories that make you stand in front of it amazed, stunned, make you think, change, change your perception of all things around you. you are raised to the top to see the foundations of the highest, purest and purest selves, to see the truth clearly and clearly. you see rampant mold in everything around you, shocked by the fact that the mold comes not only from those around you, but also from within you. some of the novels are what you can express our feelings: joy, sadness, crying, fear, hope .. you feel it while reading it, so that you can touch it inside you, make yourself confused while you cry with heroes, laugh with them and grieve with them. but few are the stories that frighten you. it is not the horror you feel when reading novels by stephen king or adgar alan poe. or what you feel while reading any novel that talks about ghosts and werewolves. rather, it is your horror while reading a symbolic philosophical novel. the horror that causes you to fear the same fate is what befell the protagonists. after every page, you are afraid to lose your sight or drown in that milky river as the author described it. sarmago terrified me. the length of my reading of the novel and my eyes are wide open, perhaps due to the ugliness of events, or perhaps it is an instinctive movement for fear of meeting the same fate. how did he manage this suffering and tragedy with this creativity? how to plot plot and events, make you see them in front of you, and live inside them. the novel demonstrated the human nature of man, making him lose only one of his senses, to reveal his instincts, animal nature, and selfishness. he is going wandering on his face, without organization, his first and last concern is to satisfy his instincts. and if he has some power, his second concern is power and control. was it strange that this woman was the only one who did not lose sight? how can an epidemic approach an angel like her, an angel who feels his responsibility and duty is to help those others who cannot help themselves. you don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re being helped or helped, but rather it&#39;s the call of duty. it is the reason why her eyes remained healthy for him. like a mother who holds the hand of her child to love without falling down, hold your hand to guide you, so that your eyes are no longer able to see. like a mother who cleans her baby without disgusting or regretted, she cleanses you of all that is attached to you from the fossil dirt. like a mother who roars when the danger approaches her children, she is killed if it is the only option to defend her group ... like a mother who still feels the responsibility towards her children even after they grow up, she still feels her responsibility towards her group, her protection and feeding ... how a pandemic like this to approach from the mass of tenderness, courage and giving like her? his description of city life by the black gangster terrified me. such an epidemic may reveal the dirty side of the human being, and it may turn a city upside down. he might return it to the first primitive ... his description of their condition without water and food made me wonder, how did the first humans live? it seems easy to get used to the difficulty of life when you find it as it is, but after you and your body get used to progress and technology, it is difficult for you to deal with nature alone. you cannot wait for rain, do not eat flowers and tree leaves, nor search for water wells and cavities. it becomes impossible for you to deal with nature face to face without stages separating you. tired but after i finished reading it, i feel that i have become more visionary than before; perhaps it is the insight that sarmago makes you realize and takes your hand to make you touch it inside you, or maybe it is only an appreciation of these eyes, after what you saw from the scourge of blindness. i don’t know exactly, but all i realize is that it changed something internal .. creativity is embodied in words. done

"a book that made me confused about my confusion, does a person spend his life day after day, or stands up to build a decent life, either a decent life or death, writes the planets as if he lives between us and witnesses our condition, i wonder how he drew that picture in the last century, i see him what he would do if he was living now and witnessing all of this tyranny, and how do young people lose their vigor and determination day after day as they face this sweeping flow of thieves who are free in broad daylight? see what he would do. he sees us submissive, deprived of pride and dignity like this .. in my view, i see the first and most important reason for complacency and despotism is education, education in its three main aspects moral education, religious education and scientific education, the fall of education led to individuals accepting submission to other than god, contentment with humiliation for life, this is because they do not understand freedom and appreciate its value, so how do you ask a bird that has been trapped in the cage since its inception to fly and fly in the sky until it opens the door to the cage in front of it, that he does not know how to fly and does not realize his pleasure and the beauty of flying away from the cage and so man, he lost some basic values that raised him to submit and the millet he was satisfied with it until he became palatable .. as for the solutions that he presented, some agreed, and some did not. the most severe thing i agree with is the presence of an alternative solution, otherwise we fall into another tyranny in a new form and a different color, but in the end it is also darkness, but i disagree with him that the solution must be from time soft and this is what differed in it. when he found the alternative solution, he must confront tyranny with full force, determination and decisiveness. the people of the oppressors must be cut off ... in general, a wonderful book that helps you reflect on the negligence in which we live as a nation, as groups and as individuals.

"this is the first novel i read to hakim, but it certainly will not be the last except for the play madness river. i never expected, before starting, to laugh with all my heart and enjoy all this joy. a wonderful work in a critical and satirical style that talks about those laws imported from abroad that are not appropriate for the egyptians and that the simple egyptian people cannot understand and that is in a beautiful and very funny style that made me increase love for the egyptian people in general and his satirical book in particular. i think that the only weakness is that it will not be understood by everyone to the same extent .. with the exception of the egyptians and who understands the egyptian accent and the fact that the egyptian people are simple, i think that someone who will read them will miss a lot of fun and hidden meanings between their lines and the fact that i was surprised a lot when i learned that they localized for a large number of languages

it will be for the writer or reader to guess and go overboard with guessing what remains for a writer who does not want to be limited to historical narratives .. rather, it dominates the desire to write about what is current reality? to guess and .. to make mistakes. . similar names are a basic problem in the novel, where i had to stop and check for sure about any character who was speaking, my first reading of dostoyevsky, an intimate novelist, speaking from within the characters of his novel, from the heart of her fears and dreams, we approach through him to man, and the teenage novel is only a long reflection on this strange creature .. quotes :. neither do you know what to do, nor do i know what to do, when the russian, when he went out of the way for which the custom drew him, did not know what to do. on the road, everything is clear: income, rank, status in society, vehicle, visits, position, woman. what remains of me at the first deviation from the paved road?

most probably, the goal of shortening it is not to be boring, because life is also an artwork of the works of the greatest creator, drafted in complete final form as a poem by pushkin. brevity is the first condition of art. but those who are not bored should be allowed to live longer. . simplicity, dear, simplicity is the most cunning. . he has a wide mind, but his heart is worried. . but this love that the strong holds for the weak is sometimes much more violent and painful than the love between two equal, because the strong bear the responsibility of his weak friend despite his will. . a person cannot live without prostration. without prostration, man cannot bear himself. . how could all the feelings of peace and the joys of the armistice all combine with the beating of my dying, unruly, painful, delicious pain, and with the appalling stormy decisions that i intend to make? i do not know. . laughter. atheism. suicide. suicide is the biggest sin of a person. but the lord is the only ruler, because he alone knows everything, standards and limits. it is our duty to pray to god for the examples of these great sinners. if you have heard of such a sin as this sin, pray to its confused supplication before you sleep, and intercede with the lord even if you do not know him, and if you do not know him, your intercession will be more beneficial as well. . but are they many of those who stand and persist in caring for others ’happiness?

"if you want to know the state of the palestinian woman, you must use this narration, then you will surely live in her airspace, moment by moment, laughing sometimes and crying sometimes, to know that life on this earth is a gift and an ordeal .... the novel spoke about magida&#39;s suffering upon her marriage to ismael, son of the camp of jenin, and the intensity of the pain that she felt was from the jordanians of palestine, where the bridge, search, torture, humiliation and all forms of torture are there. the events of the novel move us from magda and ismail’s marriage to the ignition of the al-aqsa intifada after the criminal ariel sharon defiled it and the response of the palestinian street with calls for resistance and response to the crimes of the occupier, he went out for an entire people, including men and women, old and young, with marches that roamed the entire palestinian cities, and it was necessary to sacrifice the soul and the money and all that we have, so the martyr rose and many were injured and the houses were destroyed on their residents and the money and properties were confiscated and the people were not left except god. during the al-aqsa intifada, magda was in the last months of her pregnancy, and, god willing, she would lose her fetus, nour, as a result of exposure to a young woman in a university march, and of course she was hiding the news of her pregnancy from her husband, as she was not meeting very much, due to the nature of his work as a nurse and resistance at the same time .. she rolled days and every day, the siege and restrictions on camp residents are increased in order to search for resistance fighters by the oslo authority and the zionist occupation, until the massacre of the jenin camp took place and many camp residents were martyred, homes were destroyed, and everyone was threatened with death, what was from the people the camp except to flee to their relatives outside the camp, and there magda met ishmael and lall he has to be a mother of two children who are hope and light .. the longing in the hearts of the lovers increases whenever their rows inflame the torments of separation, so was magda&#39;s case, so her husband now can no longer visit and see his children, he is one of the wanted people for the authority and the occupation army, and if he must from a conversation between the spouses, the messages placed at the grave of their child nour are the solution, as ismail sealed it with the number of zionists who were killed .... undoubtedly, the husband’s absence left the great void in his family, so magda decided to join one of the media agencies in order to spread the suffering prisoners and the people, as soon as magda became famous and her writings began, the authorities and the occupation began to pledge he was killed or arrested, and she was actually arrested for six months and then deported to amman. there, she did not remain idle but continued her media work and opened an institution that manages the affairs of palestinian women .... one morning, the tragic news to her was that her husband was besieged and he was arrested by the occupation forces, to become a hostage to them, days passed and no one met with another, and despair crept for everyone that there is no freedom after today, but god is against the resistance to kidnap an israeli soldier to become a bargain with the occupation, where the condition of the resistance was to launch he was released in exchange for a prisoner from various organizations, and ismail was scheduled to be released, as c. when he deported him to gaza, his family prepared to travel to gaza to receive her resisting son after a severe absence and a longing, to set foot in the land of gaza and bless the hands of those who were credited with his release, to embrace the husband and children, the air and the sunlight, and everything in gaza .. this is how the novel ended with seeing light and hope in the face of god almighty, and this is what every prisoner in his prison demands, and i ask god almighty to hasten relief for our leader abdullah al-barghouthi, the owner of this narration, as he is in dire need of light and hope in his life, to complete what remains of life .

"before going into the details of the novel, i would like to point out that the events mentioned in this novel are not suitable for small age groups, people with weak seals, and those with sensitive equipment ... the novel was named after the impaler, according to vlad dracula, and to the state of laashia, one of the european provinces that was affected by the ottoman tidal .. tasted foulad dracula, the bitterness of shame and disgrace, and subjected to the ottoman tutelage against his will, which made him decide to rebel against muhammad al-fatih, the ottoman governor and take revenge on the boyars ’group of traders of saxon origin who ruled in the state of laashia and revolutionized father dracul at the instigation of the king of hungary and spared no effort in punishing his people and anyone its relationship in any way with the puyars or the turks who were present at the time in bucharest and turkiche, the capital of the impaler .. what is noticeable is that the name impaled was not in vain for the son dracula, but applied with his letters to him .. it was that the foolish monster was penetrating a column whose end was flat on the back of the person, a man who was or a woman until he settles inside by the amount of two fists and then raises it on a wooden pillar and remains suspended like this until death; that depends on the path the column goes through. either he reaches his heart or until he comes out from between his eyes .. it was said that those boys were eating his food between the trunks of suspended trees. individuals had a delight in watching together he accused and their slow death .. the brutality of that crazed did not stop there but rather it was said that he was filling pots of up to five people with water or oil and leaving holes in the mouth to the heads and burning the fire underneath and coming with his old drink and he was afraid to watch the screams of people while they were ripening on the fire .. it was also said that he built a castle for him called bunary, a distance of a thousand and five hundred degrees from the earth, a ladder dug by the boyars, who gave them the chance to live by running through the piles .. he tormented a group of roma whose homelands have children and were ripped and matured of the best of them and ordered the rest to eat their brothers and subject them to him and his rule ... it is said that vlad dracula he was killed in his prison in hungary upon the recommendation of muhammad alfa the governor of al-othmani after he escaped from laashia and was betrayed by his brother radu and followed the ottoman rule ..... the novel speaks in its entirety about the myth of the return of the spirit of dracula. killed in his bathroom and crushed from his neck as if he was a bite of a bite .. he also avenges his killers and the ottomans .. when the myth of the return of the impaler and spread of fear spread throughout the ottoman empire, muhammad al-fateh decided to send an envoy to him called orhan effendi to refute that myth and transmit the reassurance in the hearts of people .. begins the novel is the journey of orhan effendi to bukhar six and paradoxes and events continue to become clear in the end that the one who commits crimes in the name of vlad dracula&#39;s spirit and has micah and michael who decided to avenge their father ... lessons learned from this novel:. if someone wrongs in the right of someone, apologize to him immediately and before it is too late, because he may leave and you will not be able to apologize to him at all. do not trust a beautiful woman who seduces you and lures you to your death. you have to suspect the least likely person to commit a heinous crime ... as a poor servant, for example. trust completely in what reason and logic say, and follow their rules with hidden intelligence, because perhaps logic of despotism becomes one of the most important reasons for reason and general safety. exposed intelligence inevitably leads to serious consequences. do not cast your mistakes on the devil, who has no energy except by whispering to you .. for your mistakes are borne by the evil emirate first. finally, it struck me strongly that all the horrific crimes committed in history against humanity adhered to religious beliefs .. i do not think that religion is absolutely related to inhumanity .. i do not know whether it makes sense for me to send a message to those who use religion as a cover for his brutality that he not only offends himself but also religion ... but i i send a message to people not to believe that any religion is linked to bloodshed ... because the sky is shaking with blood. the novel is really fun despite its miserable end and when you hold it you will not put it before you finish it

"if you have not read the novel yet, then do not see the rural areas until after you read the novel yourself. the novel is divided into three lives, the first is the month of wedding, the second is the shock of the desert, and the third is the mother of the boys. the hero of the novel is slowed down, and the first life says of him: he takes the cup from the trembling hands, and he said in a low voice: thank you, aunt. i wished for a moment with a dreamy heart, if it was he who came to address me .. but he was not, he was my brother, my younger sermon than him, who named them the writer, because he writes to them the contracts of trade, and he is called there nabati even though they are all nabat, and he who will teach me in a later life, hidden the words of the arabs and the secrets of touching the meanings with words .. it is from a line called the cover of the novel is the hero, but when we see it only a little. with one double-sided god, and with eternal truth, i say the truth. there is only a son and a mother in the universe, where every mother and son are in them. the son ishtiaq and the mother bosom. and they have birthing and birth. el-lat, the essence of all beings and the origin of the hourly images. inactive in the womb is safe, and all dormant. do not listen to those who underestimate and rise up, then han, true to mankind. it is time for my two-sided appearance to come. the nabati prophet. with these words the words of the hero started. the events of this novel take place in the seventh century ad, where wars were grinding between the persians and the romans, and between the emergence of prophets, including the prophet qureshi muhammad the messenger of god, and how the arabs became a military and pivotal power. egypt, and talks about the christianity, and there was a slight rescue of christianity, and after that maria marries an arab husband from the nabataeans ... who are the nabataeans? they are arabs who lived in egypt, iraq and the levant by islam and christianity. where did this name come from? the name is more likely to be derived from the distinctive characteristic of this huge ancient group. it is an attribute that distinguished them from the rest of the arabs, as they were able to extract water from the arid desert. this is the popular opinion, but the fact is that the nabataeans were skilled in engineering the collection of water that rarely descends with torrents. this narration tells an important time period in the history of egypt ,,. including: the ten years of the persians ’occupation of egypt and the strong arab presence in the levant and iraq before the emergence of islam, and like the long turkines that preceded the coming of amr bin al-aas to take over the affairs of egypt and many related myths. but the novel presented all of this according to the context of the events, and according to maria, whose name became maoist, after she got married to this nabati merchant .. the first life ends with a marital marriage and the second life begins, which is a journey through the sinai desert, this life was not very important, but the last life or the boys describe the customs of the arabs in marriage, describe some events, and describe the era of the many prophets in them, especially the nabati. the only comment that we hear from the nabati about islam was when they brought him a copy of the qur’an. himself: brings this, blood coming? many of the nabataeans entered islam, and the jews and the nabataeans were expelled except egypt, to pave the way for the conquest of egypt ... nabati remained alone in his home ..., and the end of the tongue was the coptic maoism. do they overlook them, and they are already heedless. so i return to him to stay with him. and together we die. then we are born again ... these two?

"this religion and the future of this religion are two valuable books for the martyr sayyid qutb, during which he presents focal points dealing with important pillars on which the great islamic religion is based. many people have forgotten about it, forgotten by others and ignored others. the most prominent of them in this book is the concept of islam as a method for human beings and in it the writer shows the nature of islam’s work in life and how it is on although it is a divine approach that depends in its mechanism and results on human efforts, it is a dynamic religion that pushes towards work, movement and construction. it urges its followers to take the reasons that motivate them to plow and sow on watering and caring for hardship and effort in order to reap the fruits .. it is the religion of instinct, the religion of logic is god’s law. here, mr. says: some people expect from this religion as long as it is a home from god to work in the lives of people in a magical supernatural mysterious reasons and without any consideration for the nature of humans and their innate energies and their material reality at any stage of their development and in any environment of their environment. . he adds: this divine approach, which islam represents in its final form, as stated by muhammad, may god bless him and grant him peace, is not achieved in the earth and in the world of people. once it comes down from god, it is not achieved by a word. be divine directly the moment you download it. and it is not achieved by simply communicating it to people and clarifying it, nor by divine oppression in the manner that its law passes through the course of astronomy and the functioning of the planets .. rather it is achieved by carrying a group of people who fully believe in it and uphold it according to its energy and strive to achieve it in the hearts of others and in their lives as well and strive to this end with all that owns. . it also shows the effect of that human effort on life and the soul, and he says: it is evident that leaving the divine approach to human endeavor to achieve it within the limits of human energy is good for human souls and good for human life .. we say this not to explain the will of god almighty in making an order about what he has made but let us record only a realistic observation of the effects of this will in the lives of worshipers. . then the writer moves to other aspects of the topic to present concepts and other characteristics of that approach, such as uniqueness, facilitation and influence, indicating each of them separately. then he concludes with several islamic principles and concepts that, in his opinion, caused a radical change in the concepts of nations and peoples, and it was a revolution in the full sense of the word that went beyond the borders of muslim societies to spread all mankind and paint civilizations with their unique ideas. which:. one humanity: liberation for the first time from the concept of national nationalism, ethnic, tribal, color, sexual, etc., and the trend towards human unity .. almighty says: o people, we created you from a male and a female and made you people and tribes to know that if i honor you with god, i fear you, god is knowing an expert. . great truth of god. . generous humanity: islam made human dignity derived from its own humanity, not from any other offer such as gender, color, class, wealth ..... etc .. the almighty said :. we have honored the children of adam, carried them on land and sea, provided them with good things, and preferred them over many of those who created us a preference. and when we said to the angels, bow down to adam, and worship only satan, my father, and he was proud, and he was one of the disbelievers. .... great truth of god. . one nation: making islam from a faith is a supporter of gathering, because belief is the most generous characteristic of the human spirit. the almighty said: this is your nation, one nation, and i am your lord. . edema and creation: islam established the foundations of morality in society and established systems and legislated for it and made it a basis in all dealings and made it a philosophy and etiquette even in times of wars and battles .. the almighty says: and fulfill the covenant of god if you pledge and do not deny faith after its affirmation and you have made god a guarantor for you if god knows what you are doing and you will not be the same as the one whose void has been revoked after the power of ankatha. you take your faith as an income between you. to be a nation that is more of a nation than god. . here are some beautiful quotes from wonderful passages mentioned in the book: human instinct in its origin is consistent with the law of the universe .. when a person departs with his life system from that law, he not only collides with the vast universe, but also collides with his instinct that is between his sides, and he suffers, is torn, confused, anxious, and lives as humanity lives today in the torment of unhappiness despite all the scientific victories. and all material cultural facilities. . it is not true, starting with the fact that this divine approach costs the human psyche a more difficult effort than to tolerate it or to become long on it .. it is a truly noble approach, but at the same time it is an innate approach that relies on the balance of instinct and spends this balance. and its advantage is that he knows his way from the first moment to this balance. he knows his way to the human soul from the first touch. he knows her paths and curves, and he gently tramples her; he knows her entrances and exits, and he walks up to her in an upright manner and knows her powers and capabilities, so she never surpasses her; she knows her needs and aspirations, and she meets them completely; when islam first confronted mankind, it faced this reality with the balance of instinct alone. the balance of instinct was with this debt; despite the long generations that passed and it accumulated over the ruins of the broad pre-islamic reality .. but the instinct of instinct was stronger than all of this aggregate; and the response of instinct was sufficient to shake that aggregate. . god has imposed jihad on believers not to hate people to convert to islam but to establish on the earth his just, upright and just order that people choose their faith that they love under this system that includes both muslim and non-muslims in complete justice. the almighty says: there is no compulsion in religion, adulthood has emerged from the abolition.

"this book examines the underdevelopment resulting from the emergence of the phenomenon of the newly independent countries, which is called the third world .. it is known that there are many previous studies and studies on underdevelopment, but these studies have taken economic, industrial and sometimes social perspectives without examining the study of the underdeveloped human condition .. this book is so a type of entrance to the psychology of underdevelopment, which is an attempt based on observation and psychological and social analysis of the phenomena experienced by the oppressed person, an attempt that is not intended to reach final results but rather to contribute to the results that complement the social and economic studies of this phenomenon .. the human being of these societies was not seen as an essential element in any study whatsoever, so the author intended to put things in their proper framework by studying this category and analyzing its properties and knowing its structure and dynamism .. this book is a study of the psychology of the underdeveloped person, as the psychology of underdevelopment in human terms is the same psychological the oppressed human being is under the rule of oppression imposed on him who holds the reins of power .. the writer also worked on overcoming the superficiality that overshadowed the studies of development scholars on the reality of underdevelopment and tried to prove that the underdeveloped person stands as an obstacle in the face of changing the backward social structure due to the suspicion tahama with his psychological structure .. the writer started the first section of the book with the psychological features of the underdeveloped presence by identifying and defining the backwardness and put forward the theories of backwardness represented by the superficial method in the study of backwardness and a social and other economic method that attributes the cause of backwardness to industrial and technical backwardness and structural economic backwardness and then presents the psychological perspective of backwardness and psychological characteristics of him and the most important these characteristics are oppression where a person goes through three stages: the stage of oppression and submission resulting from the complexes of deficiency, shame and disorder of permanence. the stage of persecution. the stage of rebellion and confrontation. after studying these characteristics, it is necessary to study the retarded mentality and its systematic mental characteristics, which suffer from the disorder of methodology of thinking and the limitations of dialectical reasoning. the writer attributed the mental retardation to two factors: education policy, mental retardation, relations of domination, subjugation, and mental retardation ... the author ends this section by studying the unconscious life of the oppressed person its unconscious dynamics, that is, the hidden and driving factors of underdevelopment: the relationship of authoritarianism and subjugation of cataract and resulting in anxiety of the castration. nature impinges on the image of the bad mother and leads to anxiety of abandonment. and underneath these coats of human being subjugated, defensive methods must be used in an unsuccessful attempt to get rid of the injustice situation. this is what the author presented in the second section, where he spoke about the four most important defensive methods, namely: self-sufficiency. either by sticking to the past and returning to the glorious past. or thawing in the group and returning to the clan family, as he finds refuge in him from some of his responsibilities. or even relying on others. identification by the ruler. identification by authoritarian identification with identification of his flesh, aggression, values and lifestyle. superstitious control of destiny. there are two types of this control. either control the present, for example the awliya, their shrines and their dignity, the jinn, the orcs and the devil, the hostile relationships, the envy and the magic. where the oppressed person attributes what he is exposed to in his life for one of these reasons. or the second type of control, which is controlling the future, such as flying, dream interpretation, fortune-telling and divination. where his fate is related to one of these aspects. or to attribute his status and backwardness, and anything that was destined to be delivered to him. violence. some manifestations of violence: masked violence. the aggression, whether self-defeating or outward-oriented. symbolic violence. like delinquent behavior. existential tension and persecutory relations. among the psychological theories that explained aggression and violence: a view of animal psychology. a psychoanalytic view. phenomenological point of view. finally, it is necessary to talk about the position of women in the underdeveloped society, which has the largest share of oppression and marginalization. the writer has drawn features of the oppression that women live in the industrious and under-industrious milieu, in the middle class and in the privileged group. one of the oppressions experienced by women is deficiency and reduction. and the looting is either economic, sexual or ideological and is the most dangerous. among the defensive methods women use against oppression are narcissistic inflation and indirect control over men.

"i came back with my review ...:. i am always wary of many books that meet a great boom and echo, and this is based on many books i read because of the uproar around them, then i discover that they do not deserve all of this in my view. we say this is my personal opinion. but i allow myself to give the opportunity to such books as perhaps they deserve all of this and more, and some books have proven this as well ... but i have noticed that the majority of these books harvest this noise from the general readership because they touch something inside a person, touch his feelings or suffering and start to manipulate the feeling on the surface, one of us would like it, but if many of them were subjected to a fair evaluation, why would these works not be huge? this book i see is a book closer to the commercial, which tickles the religious senses of others and presents a utopian image of a person’s relationship with his lord, and completely ignores a person’s relationship with his community .. i can say with a mouthful of narration that narrates the horizon narrow, and the judgments that it claims miqa, it is essentially superficial and contradictory ... the writer drops the story of the miserable wife ella who lost much of her soul after a exhausted life of caring for a husband and caring for the children and then met her dear when she decided to search for work on the love story that rumi and tabrizi fought in her words ... the narration the novelist and the syntax are excellent, the style is smooth and enjoyable, and very fit when you lose fitness in reading. hold this book until it paves you back to reading again ... i am not skilled in literary criticism, but i will write my abstract opinion:. the work is not that strong enough to fuss this noise .. it frankly misses a lot .. a very consuming and boring idea .. it does not arouse any enthusiasm for me .. the only good thing is to link the past to the present and this leads us to criticize the historical aspect that i see very weak in this novel. there is no strong historical history or observation of that period, the novelist could leapfrog the novel to higher levels by supporting the historical side in greater depth than the surface in which it was taken up ... and whoever recites azazel and the granada trilogy or the narrator of cordoba will fully realize the weakness of his historical side ... one of the advantages of fictional work for me is that no one conquers his idea, unlike books intellectual or objective .. dialogues and you can choose what suits you and each in his opinion right and wrong, but this novel felt that the victory of the idea of mysticism is very present .. it always highlights that the last word of the sun and his thoughts. the ideas of others are presented in a way that appears wrong and superficial. there is a lot of exaggeration in that ... so i say that the horizon of the novel is very narrow .. and contradictory .. people are two classes: a hard-liner who loves pleasure or worship governs by appearance ... tabrezi&#39;s category: love and love and outside is excluded even if you drink wine ... a childish and naive idea, not from sufism in something .. it promotes that islam is just that way, as depicted by shams who is in the novel, and besides that they are ignorant and lost much of islam .. this is a kind of madness and contradiction and i only show you what i see ... it is not reasonable to ask others that they do not make judgments regarding our actions and that this is only between us and god, but man is present in a society and his actions most of which affect this community a pei or willing .. the quran came with individual, community, political, military, and family organizations. you cannot separate yourself from society. then you say, i will drink a glass of wine and i will practice sweet disbelief and then promote it as the ideal islam. yes, i strongly believe that there are behaviors that we have nothing to do with it, as it is between the servant and his lord, as long as it does not affect society or my freedom as an individual ... rather, sufism presents its most naive form ... the truth is that after reading it for a long time, i slowly began to hate: what does this narration want? what do i need to deliver? none of what was mentioned in the introduction to the book did not convince me that there is none of that which profoundly communicated or presented .. no love, no love, no worship ... unjustified reverence for the relationship of shams and rumi is strange? there is contempt for the rest of humanity in an indirect and perhaps unintended way .. the sun and those like it are the mystics in this narration who were able to reach very high levels of spirituality that would not be understood by the simple people who look to islam without what is seen by those who dance and rotate and then their souls are united at levels etc. etc. then there are many nodal fallacies that i cannot yet pass safely ... what does it mean if the adopted child in rumi house watches you see dead souls and talks to them as if they have. on other worlds ... then there are a good number of transgressions that have no origin but flaws ... as for the forty rules of love itself, the rule of rule is not new or an invention from the writer, but i can say that the writer failed to include the rules in the template of the novel .. the topic turned into a lecture and indoctrination .. as if they were numbered paragraphs to be included .. in the sentences, the inclusion of the rules was very, very weak and not appropriate for the fictional work. therefore, i say work is a novelist that is not good at all and does not deserve that commotion, but it caresses our feelings through religious thoughts that contain many fallacies so that we assume that we really agree with everything and that we are tired of the intervention of others and their narrow view of our relationship with our lord while we are part of all the characters in the novel ... ... we judge, narrow and expand worship, how we want and then read a book that simulates emotion only so we tend to it and believe that we are always the victim ... the book is a weak summary of those who will read it with a mind and heart, and will discover from the first quarter the shallowness of the historical and eclectic aspect in it. i do not advise you to read it without reading sufism from several references and without reading about al-roumi and the history of that period ... in the end, in the book are good things that we take and return the rest ..

"under the slogan of independent cinema, you must go beyond what you want. the genius of the first experience lies in the difference in innocence in smoothness, and this was done by the editor, director, and director ahmed abdullah completely in his first experience. heliopolis movie. this film belonging to the so-called independent cinema, that cinema that came to light in search of freedom outside the grip of major production companies. in heliopolis, the difference in everything was in the scenario, lighting, montage, sound, and sometimes acting. ahmed abdullah and his team succeeded in breaking several tabs on top of which was the movie scenario, as the film is almost without a story, and there is no dramatic conflict in it or any climax, and the characters are also completely superficial. unpainted, you move on paper and you remain trapped during the movie without meaning or aim, causing you to be affected. the lighting of the film is a miraculous rebellious thing, which is only flawed because it is not present in the internal scenes and sometimes not in the external scenes. as for the stranger, it is the montage, as the director of the work has experience in the field of montage, and when he made his first movie as a director and wrote his story and his scenario, he chose a story for four separate dramatic strings that he only collects in heliopolis. it is known that such quality needs a very sensitive and accurate montage to make the viewer does not feel the transition from one thread to the next, but from the seemingly long-term difference, the moves were terrifying at times, uncomfortable at all times. even here the difference ends and the innocence adopted by the director in the performance of his actors begins and everyone falls into the trap of inattention, except for a little. khaled abu al-naja is a spotlight in the film with his smooth and persuasive performance. hanan mutawi led a character who almost drew well within the limits of the amputated character dramatically, even if the mistake was not her fault. fair unconvincing performance and an attempt to perform the introverted personality by looking at the land and hum for the degree of illness yusra al-louzi is still satisfied with her beautiful face only on the screen either. he damaged the dramatic streak of the soldier as a whole and made him a short film inside the film, and the genius that they announced did not appear in these scenes. and it remains smooth to transfer this independent film to the film strips to be displayed in theaters under the independent movie slogan, as if that sentence should be after. if the possibilities of this cinema do not allow all of this, and we have to overlook it in order to move to another level on the ladder of independent cinema, it remains to shout at the filmmakers all the amount of boredom that inhabited the film from its inception until the end of it to the extent that even the sympathizers of the first experience lost their sympathy. finally, heliopolis remains alive, and the film is not a wonderful life. its history cannot be reduced to the time of foreigners, the fifties and earlier, and the new millennium in a humiliating shorthand for about forty years from the history of the neighborhood and egypt as a whole. a final note: when making a movie about heliopolis, please refer to laughing, playing, grandfathering and love for tariq al tlemceni, and in the apartment of heliopolis for muhammad khan.

"excerpts from the novel &quot;the rules of the forty love&quot; by elif shafak. . she knew that their relationship was not deep, but she said to herself that it is not necessary for the emotional bond to occupy a priority in the list of married couples, especially for a married couple. a long time has passed since their marriage. in marriage, things are much more important than passion and love such as understanding, affection, mercy, and more the divine things that any husband may offer is forgiveness, but love is secondary compared to all these things unless one lives in the folds of novels or romantic films where heroes always depict larger people from life and their love is nothing but a myth. . as if you can get to know a man’s personality during eight months. my father and i have been married for twenty years, and yet we cannot pretend that one of us knows everything about the other that eight months is not considered anything in any relationship. . the twenty-first century does not differ much from the thirteenth century and they will note in history that these two centuries were an era of religious conflicts to an unprecedented extent and an era in which cultural misunderstanding and a general feeling of insecurity and fear of the other prevailed and in such times the need is to love more severe than ever. . when you kill someone, something of him transmits to you a sigh, smell, or gesture. i hang them around my neck like hidden necklaces. i feel they are firmly and heavily above my flesh. even though i do not feel comfortable, i used to live with this burden and accepted it as part of my job. . . inside each person there is a hidden desire to kill one of them one day, and people do not realize this until after they have spoken to them, they think that they are unable to kill, but the issue is a matter of conscience only. sometimes a mere gesture is enough to fan their anger. one is in the wrong place and at the wrong time, as destructive tendencies can appear in people who are kind and respectful people in normal circumstances, as anyone can kill anyone, but no person can deliberately kill a stranger. . believe me, there is nothing new. i have clients from the most parts of the world. after dosing some cups, i hear the same stories from all of them. people are themselves everywhere, the same food, the same water, and the same old folly. . the way in which we see god is only a reflection of the way we see ourselves, so if god did not bring to our minds nothing but fear and blame, then this means that a great deal of fear and blame is flowing in our souls, but if we see god filled with love and mercy, we will be like that. . this is how life is. when you tell someone the truth, he hates you, and the more you talk about love, the more it hates you. . whatever we are or wherever we live, we feel in our hearts that we are incomplete, as if we lost something and must recover it, but most of us never find that thing. as for those who can find it, very few dare to go out and search for it. . do not judge the way people communicate with god. each person has his own way and prayer that god does not take us with our word, but looks in the depths of our hearts, not rituals or rituals that make us believers, but whether our hearts are clear or not. . one of the things that helped me personally in the past to stop interfering in the affairs of others around me and when i was frustrated months that i would not be able to change them i was instead of intrusion or negativity i was inclined to acquiescence some people mistake when they mix between compliance and weakness, so compliance is a form of peaceful acceptance on the terms of the universe, among which are things that we cannot currently change or understand. . thought and love consist of different materials. thought binds humans in a contract, but love dissolves all nodes. thought always warned, and he advises: beware a lot of euphoria, while love says: do not care. i take this risk and while thought cannot fade. easily, love collapses easily and becomes a rubble on its own, but the treasures are hidden between rubble and the broken heart hides treasures. . most of the world&#39;s problems stem from linguistic errors and from a simple misunderstanding that does not take words in their apparent meaning at all, and when the circle of love enters, the language that we know is outdated. the thing that cannot be expressed in words can only be perceived by silence. . loneliness and being alone are two different things. when you are alone, it is easy to fool yourself and imagine that you are on the right path. as for being alone is better for us because it means being alone without feeling that you are alone, but in the end it is better for you to search for someone who is like a mirror you remember that you cannot really see yourself except in someone else&#39;s heart and with god in you. . no matter what happens in your life, and no matter how troublesome things appear, do not enter despair, and even if all the doors remain closed, god will open a new path for you. ahmed, your lord, it is easy for you to praise god when everything is fine. the sufi praises god not only for what he granted to him, but praises him also for everything that god has forbidden it. . patience does not mean that you bear the difficulties negatively, rather it means being far-sighted so that you trust the end result that will result from any process. what does patience mean? it means that you look at the thorn and see the rose, you look at the night and see the dawn. as for impatience, it means that you are short-sighted and you cannot see the result that god&#39;s lovers never run out of patience because they know that in order for the crescent to become full, it needs time. . there is no big difference between east and west, south and north. whatever your destination, you must make the journey you take a journey inside you. if you travel inside you, you will be able to cross the vast world and beyond. . when the midwife finds that the pregnant woman does not suffer during labor, she knows that the path is not clear for her newborn, so she will not give her newborn if and in order to generate a new soul, it must be pain and just as the clay needs high heat to intensify, love is not complete except with pain. . the pursuit of love changes us, so no one seeks love and matures during his journey, so when the search for love begins, it starts to change from inside and outside. . there are fake teachers and fake professors in this world with many stars in the visible universe. do not confuse selfish people who are motivated by power and true teachers. an honest spiritual teacher directs your attention to him and does not expect absolute obedience or complete admiration from you but rather helps you to appreciate yourself the ministry of the interior respects that true teachers are as transparent as crystal passing through god&#39;s light through them. . because you are very careful to obtain the approval of others, you will not get rid of their criticism, no matter how hard you try. . do not try to resist the changes that stand in your way, but let life live in you and do not worry if you turn your life upside down so how do you know that the side you are used to is better than the side that will come. . i do not think that there is a problem with sadness, but rather the opposite is hypocrisy that makes people happy. as for the truth, it makes them feel sad. . the true filth lies inside, while the other filth is removed by washing, and there is one type of filth that cannot be cleansed with pure water, which is a pollute of hatred and intolerance that pollutes the soul. . if a person wants to change the way in which people treat him, he must first change the way in which he treats himself and if he does not learn how to love himself completely and sincerely, there is no way in which he can love, but when he reaches that stage he will thank every thorn that others have thrown at him. this indicates that roses will rain down soon, then how can one blame others for not respecting him if he does not consider himself worthy of respect. . the past is a vortex, if you let it dominate your present moment, it will absorb you and sweep you away from what time is but an illusion and all you need is to live this very moment. this is all that matters. . do not care where the road will lead you, but focus on the first step, as it is the most difficult step that you must take responsibility for. once you take that step, let everything happen naturally and the rest will come by itself. do not go with the current, but be the current. . the internet has exaggerated behavior outside its scope and made it gentle, giving the opportunity to flirt without having to feel guilty and adventurous without risk, as if to eat delicious, forbidden food without worrying about you due to the extra calories. . how can love be so serious?

"to start with, i do not see the book as an anecdotal collection, and its texts are closer to blogging articles or blogging as they are called. this does not rule out the existence of some anecdotal texts that bear a sincere feeling, and i think this is what distinguishes the author most. however, the mixing of the style of blogging with the style of fictional writing led to something similar to water dilution, so the book became more lean. does this mean that blogging weakens the language? this depends on the author&#39;s view of him. among the writers is someone who respects writing in all cases and looks at blogs as channels for publication, so he writes faithfully what he writes in paper books. but many view it as a white card that allows the author to license everything and override the language on the pretext that these are not literary texts; these are notations. . i suffered in the book from abundant linguistic mistakes, mistakes everywhere and everything, even in the simplest of rules. i suspect that the reason is the weakness of the writer&#39;s language and the book&#39;s reviewers as well, as long as all these errors have gone under their noses without noticing. for example, how does a writer in al-fusha who like to say that one eyebrow is raised and does not feel stabs in his ears like? and, worse, how can he do this twice in the same book, separated by only a few pages; the same phrase with the same two errors? . this is a simple example, and the mistakes are not only in grammar, but in many linguistic and verbal methods. she says, for example, in a position: i put my leg under me and it is a very colloquial expression in the wrong’s way, so what is this from me that puts its leg under it? it is nice that rehab writes in arabic far from colloquially, while she originally studied it in english literature, meaning that she has something that might motivate her to write in english, but i would like her to be more jealous of the arabic that she preferred.

"ok. after the novel concluded the truth i was confused. let me talk about the novel colloquially. first, the novel does not have a plot. meaning, we can divide the novel into novels. the novel, up to the first page, is her story revolving around marwan and his journey with the draft novel that i want to write. during his trip, he falls in love with two boys and betrays them with his next and one blue, so i had no taste ... which was the most ridiculous part of the novel. the second section, biddour, on marwan al-ali during his journey in search of an idea for the novel that i want to write, to discover a book in which state security secrets reveal the involvement of members of the anti-drug police with drug dealers in facilitating trade in exchange for a percentage of profits and the arabic film that we sure heard about before that. this part is quite acceptable. the next section is bidour about marwan and his involvement with the hamas group in palestine because of his brother mazen who is a member of the muslim brotherhood who is a branch of hamas in egypt .. the most important thing is that marwan is kidnapped and does a certain task in palestine and in the end they change his name and identity and flee to switzerland .. the tale is empty. of course, it was necessary to burn some events in order to clarify the general atmosphere of the novel and the reason for the lack of plot, even if the one who burned it did not live from the novel. the important. the novel feature has two needs. the most wonderful style for a young writer, and this is his first novel. the second need is the last part of the novel that took place in palestine. this was the real fun part. the disadvantages of the novel are many, but some of them can be overlooked as the novel is the writer&#39;s first work. first, the dialogue at the beginning of the novel, the writer made a mistake in it, and i found it previously in youth novels more than once .. it is a topic that mentioned the names of the two parties to the dialogue within the dialogue. this makes the dialogue appear as if it is a dialogue with a translated or dubbed movie. ..but this point gradually disappeared in the second text of the novel, and it almost disappeared in the last part. the second disadvantage is that the characters are not adequately drawn. most of the characters came out very superficial..and many personalities appeared and disappeared unnecessarily. the third defect i mentioned earlier is that there is no plot. the novel can be divided into separate stories. the fourth disadvantage is the lack of consistency of events at a certain rate. sometimes the events are very fast, sometimes they are very slow. despite all of this, the novel is good. the beautiful style of the narration and the standard language compels me to overcome defects and i say that the work is good. the novel, compared to other youth novels, is ranked higher than many of the idiots who gained fame and deserved approval. waiting for other works and better development, god willing

islamic world hit its african and asian sides with colonialism, and since napoleon laminated egypt with artillery, and the soldiers of the ottoman mamluk empire, the backward, with swords, arabs, and muslims, fought against the khawaja complex, everything that came in the west shines with gold, if someone in the west claimed that he saw god in a dream and said to him, he accepted islam, they say so and so in the west he holds a degree in physics, he saw god and said to him, islam accepted, while the uncle of his servant, the seller in the countries of the arab world, said the same words to accuse him of ignorance and insanity ... the american and the europeans, perhaps the same reason that called him to stand in the presence of sadat and the egyptian peace treaty, are the same ideas that everything that comes from the west is called the gold in the eyes of my eyes and my head and western civilization is one of the most important civilizations in the universe, but more presented to humanity more than all the eastern civilizations presented in its history regardless of the phenomenon colonization and world wars as for western society, there are neither feathers on the head nor the eye, and feathers like the arab societies and others do not have feathers and invitees, but their chances of education were better, so when they set up, the monument makes sense in the west. there are jugglers and there are swindlers who treat people with fish, laughter, and yoga, the whole world it is considered that writings such as eric von dunkin fall within the scope of false science and review through the web the hypothesis of ancient astronauts and you will see that egyptologists and real history scientists see that such words do not relate to science and not everything that glitters gold reaches sales of writings e a swiss researcher, as we have admittedly argued that he is a true researcher to a million books annually and wrote more than one book. in fact, the classification of such works as false science or writings falsely or falsely depends on the nature of the science itself, which relies on refutation, not emphasizing material, not on fiction. therefore, this man&#39;s writings are popular, while for example, we do not expect that the latest writings of physicists will reap the same sales. they are simply like science fiction novels, but they are sophisticated. it is not possible to subject the jinn and ghosts to scientific studies, so all scientists except for the supporters of the false science consider that ghosts and jinn have reasons. psychological and nervous and some people measured the electromagnetic impulses in some places that everyone claims contain ghosts, then they found that these pulses in these places are very high and that it is the reason that affects people’s minds and because of the spread of popular accounts around a place that has ghostly children or a woman who wears a costume moein claims many people that they saw the same ghost, then the scholars met by comparing the testimonies of many people who were subjected to these experiments and found that the testimonies, despite their closeness, are not the same as what denies the existence of ghosts, and this is why science is called knowledge on this basis, the idea that i measure on it was brother / eric f. and duncan believed in these metaphysical beings mainly regardless of his evidence in the sixty books. so why does he not try to prove that god sent from the sky angels metaphysics and taught human beings how to build civilizations if we were going to fade in the name of science and say that aliens visited the earth and built civilizations and evidence is these drawings and these stones etc. what prevents many scholars from believing the existence of god almighty, knowing that i, praise be to god, is a believer and a muslim. i am talking about scholars if you deny what you do not see in the name of science. why do some of you call these perceptions a note, no, masters of science has a different path from religion and spirituality and science is characterized by people von duncan must first prove the existence of aliens and work with other research teams to establish the existence of other rational beings other than us in space as well as to be advanced because, for information, many hypotheses about the universe say in a clear way, but there are rational and non-advanced beings and therefore do not communicate with earth, as for there are basically no sane creatures, but there are living beings, and either there is no life essentially outside the planet earth, despite the observation of the hubble observatory of many planets outside or inside the galaxy, but it is so far away that it cannot be studied closely to make sure they are simply valid. the bottom line is not all what shines in gold von duncan began writing his books in the year, during which time he talked about the aliens under the american and russian space programs and also because of the american flying tests that relied on camouflage through these false novels, but his books did not achieve wide spread until after a movie and series. stargate gate of stars in the year and although it is an entertaining movie but it falls under the broad science fiction item and then after the popularity that these ideas acquired cinematically and in science fiction novels these false science supporters began to promote the same hypotheses on a non-scientific basis gentlemen, he has a well-known style on von duncan that proves the existence of aliens mainly whether in the planets near us or far away and to obtain clear archaeological evidence from there then for him to claim that they were guests on the earth, how do we accept this insult to us in the recent period what the egyptians are deprived of their history in the name of the jews and the servitude of the children of israel sometimes and in the name of magic sometimes and now the people of space are sometimes important for the egyptians to appear ignorant and backward and did not build the pyramids what is this ridiculous .. why do we not believe the writings of the claimants from the arab world that the pyramids were built by a people returned and thamud and why do not we take a long time in absurdity is more art and because he returned and thamoud mainly from the people of space, no one asked himself who owns the spacecraft how he does not have the video and recording techniques, so he records what he saw on the caves and stones, who owns the spacecraft, how does he not have television, medicine, antibiotics, and everything related to human civilization with a link then scientists begin pseudo-pseudo-deviation is more in search of a solution to this dilemma and they find nothing more than stupidity in envisioning a catastrophe for which there is no scientific evidence except for one book by aristotle on a land not related to egypt and may have sunk signed and toppled all this if that was the case then it makes sense that this catastrophe will topple the life we know it and it will topple the stone before els the satellite is soft and it is logical that more than three thousand years of archaeological research and exploration that we will find any technical method and not only a stone that proves that a great civilization preceded the present time ... who searches more will know the responses of the doctor and the distinguished scientist / zahi hawas on these peer-to-peer because it is an archaeologist he has a capacity and he can argue with them on the pretext and opinion .. tariffs in the name of science ... and science is relative, objective, cumulative and material, so what i wrote is literary criticism not my knowledge, science has other rules that are not known to them and i will add to you prose a line i really hope that there will be an advanced space civilization but the truth is that my regards have not and will not yet exist.

"i can very easily make fun of this book and say that i wasted my time reading it or that its author appeared to be true and that he is not a real writer, and other subjective talk, but i will speak from my personal point of view as someone who has been reading for more than a year. historical writing has origins and rules, it is never easy to enter a historical era rich in events and decide to write a novel about it, the natural path that most amateurs will take is the direct narration of events and dealing with historical events directly with the addition of side characters that meet in the middle of the novel to reach the peak, but the most difficult it is to make the events of the novel a reflection of what is happening on the ground, that the historical events are merely a snapshot in the background, but its strong influence is evident in the course of the events of the novel, the novel unfortunately took the first course .. i was not optimistic about the good when the author decided to explain at the beginning of his novel some of the historical events he directly feared, and i feared that this was due to his expectation of the quality of his readers who may not know much about this period, but when i reached the end of the novel i found that nothing new was presented on the level of what he presented in his previous works that relied on excitement and surprise, tales that do not rise to the level of the novel the historical, a direct narration of the events and faded backgrounds, figures that have no dimensions or depth, any character in the novel that can completely erase it from the novel and that will not affect the final work, a summons to scenes we saved from the many cinemas presented in films in our home by a man, sunrise, sunset, and series of ismail abd old hafiz and others, i thought that hamad murad to keep him on his audience, who knows him well and give him what is looking for the thrill and exciting, and there are several quick points i would like to conclude by. i do not think it is appropriate for the author to continue to mix between the paschal and the vernacular, to the extent that he decided to write a popular example of al-qahb with classical. the characters are rushed to take actions that contradict the image he drew, as the coward suddenly turns into a brave and traitor to my homeland. there are some passages in the novel written in a different script, which means that they may be memoirs of the historical figures covered in the novel, and i suspect that he should have mentioned that at the end of the novel. the writer made a great effort to collect historical events and link them together

"this book literally made me headaches because of the many confusing and strange information in it that stops the mind and re-read it and try to classify it. i tried to search for some of what was mentioned in the book in the google search engine, but i did not reach any result remember, let alone match it to what the author mentioned, maybe i did not search correctly or that this information does not exist, or i should be skeptical about it. the book was characterized by exaggeration, and pictures of the space people in the way that american films depict, exactly if there were residents of other planets who may not necessarily be like the image imposed on us .. then what about the space helmets? if they are more developed and advanced than us, they will have their own technologies that are not necessarily similar to ours, such as helmets, ships, planes and clothes. the book included some pictures of antique drawings that support his words, but it made me confused. for example, i pondered a long time about one of the drawings that the writer says is for a woman with a hairstyle and who wears socks and pants. in general, the author reckons his fertile imagination .. for me, everything that i read must pass the balance of the qur’an and the correct prophetic sunnah. in the qur’an there is no mention of rational creatures created by god, but the angels, humans, jinn and the last two are the ones charged with. if we assume that there are inhabitants of other planets, and this possibility may be possible, then it is not a miracle of god, then they will not be but among these three. unless they have their own messengers and books and we cannot talk about what we do not have knowledge .. also why is the distant assumption that whoever came from heaven are aliens, they may be angels, and angels have knowledge that we do not know, as it was stated in the qur’an that the two angels harut and marut have they went down with the people of babel, teaching them magic to have a temptation, and there are many signs that indicate the descent of the angels and embody them in human beings .. why is also the other assumption that our human race is unable to develop its own civilizations without the intervention of aliens? humans who have come to this development in this era are not unique in their kind, and there must be throughout the history geniuses and scientists have come to more than what modern man reached from the sciences, and those sciences have disappeared, including alchemy, alchemy, alchemy and others. let us take into consideration that the ancients were their longest ages, reaching hundreds of years, and have a long time to learn, develop, teach, and reconstruct the earth, but this is god’s year in his being, nations appear, prevail, degenerate, fall out, and appear. others do not know much about their predecessors, and so on .. generally the book makes you think and research a lot.

"a revolutions are not always inclusive, expressive of society as a whole, nor fair .. they may be factional, class, or ideological demands, for example what is happening in thailand now, and their demands are not always fair or reasonable and may be against democracy in some cases by exclusion and intimidation, it is in the end is an expression of the demands of a part of society, and not all of society has less or more in number and proportion in the state. b revolution, in general, is not the only way to change, and there are other ways to change and reform. c revolution may turn into a separate obsession, desire or passion, regardless of the community&#39;s need or reading the reality. d revolution is an ongoing process in the sense of change, not in the sense of demonstrations and clashes. is it necessary to dismantle the concept of the revolution itself: what do we mean by the term revolution? is it a people&#39;s uprising against power only ... or is it a broader concept than that on the socio-political level and not on the individual level. is the officer the number that went out in demonstrations, for example? or is it the type of claims and the desired change? or is it geographically expanded to include a greater number of cities and geographical regions? then the most important question:. what is it based on? what is based on our agreement that the people really came out of a revolution after we defined and defined its conditions? is every revolution obligatory to meet its demands legally and constitutionally? or is there a legal and constitutional cover required for the demands of any revolution? new notes: february:. the author is not an academic and only. i remembered from ressala&#39;s book on the way to our culture that orientalists were studying muslim societies and presenting the results of their studies to the rulers of the west so that they could direct them to what they wanted. and our author is not far from that. trying to study the paths of revolutions and model them is nothing but an intelligence effort to guide and transform any revolution in the bud in the bud in the form of what serves american interests. and the twentieth century is full of examples of this ending with the arab spring. the second important note. it is the iranian revolution as a model of a complete revolution opposed to the american interest at the time of its establishment. and i had started her study in an analytical study to know how the revolution managed to control the joints of the state and get rid of the old system as a whole and neutralize the army and police and the judiciary or control them quickly. unfortunately the project was not completed due to the security prosecution. first article link:. : //. . / / .... the third note:. it is the growing role of the media and television channels in general year after year and decade after decade. what abdel nasser, hitler and mussolini used to say in a sermon inflaming the masses backed by measures on the ground buying the friendliness of the masses such as agrarian reform, for example, or the external threat or the call of ancient roman nationalism, for example, in the case of mussolini. new leaders have not prepared for all of this. suffice them with a conspiratorial inflammatory speech focused by the media led by experts of moral guidance through studying the masses and their behaviors. unfortunately. it appears that the awareness of the masses in general has not developed sufficiently to meet the development of moral guidance methods. they will respond to me, saying that it is the conscious youth and the university students who are leading the opposition to the coup now. i always say young people are the fuel for revolutions. as it happened in january. but they can not manage the helm after overthrowing the system. or do not have a vision for the post-revolutionary wave. as long as elites and party and community leaders remain captive to old perceptions and ideas. no revolution is completely victorious. i invite you to know what is happening in thailand and ukraine now. as examples of failed revolutions in their demands and awareness. in the end, the difference between the true and comprehensive revolution and the factional uprising and narrow popular demands is in seeing this change revolution and the breadth and depth of its demands. what happened in january was an uprising with limited demands. people want to improve conditions. activists went out against the security crackdown. islamic currents went out to support the sharia and enable it to a greater degree. and the revolutions in general that crenten studied in his book do not fall outside this framework. most of them were the revolution of the marginalized and oppressed classes against other classes, and thus in the exchange of roles between the classes and some of them. a comprehensive revolution is a revolution that has a clear vision and ideology for reforming conditions in general in the whole world. muhammad, may god bless him and grant him peace, came up with a revolution from this framework. islam itself was, is, and will continue to be a revolution against tyranny and slavery when allah the exalted, the majestic. the last and most important note in my opinion was considered the will of a war-weary combatant. the conflict is global and so to speak. not with sisi, with a military council, or with kings here and there. this does not mean adopting the option of carrying weapons, for example, on the al qaeda method. but. our knowledge of the depth, breadth and coverage of the problem. it makes us better able to guide it and awareness of its dimensions. how many aborted projects because of the lack of awareness and the most prominent example that brings me to mind is that morsi came to sisi himself, so i have no explanation except for the lack of awareness .. and in the past the brotherhood came to abdel nasser as well. the revolution must be directed against the real enemy. awareness first, then to stop cognitive bleeding and mental and intellectual distortion, which they are leading a craft and perform. then, by adopting the opposite action, let us get out of the circle of reaction and aborted dreams. i borrow this paragraph from an article i recently read for a syrian writer named ahmed daadouch:. finally, we realize that evading the global protestant jewish conspiracy will only take place with a counter plot that possesses the same ingredients, and is woven with the same savvy, and looks at the conflict from a perspective that expands to the whole world and extends for centuries to come, and is based on the intentions of shari&#39;a gradually when necessary, and realizes that the declaration of a sunni islamic state in any country on the ground today will push the arabs and the west to fail it before it ripens ...

"how to spoil a wonderful movie for everyone in the late nineties and early years of the new millennium, the british group produced an unprecedented documentary series on life on the planet in prehistoric times, which brought about a completely new breakthrough in the field of documentary films that followed dozens of films and episodes documentary after that. the series was great and revolutionary in everything .. production, thought, vision, and computer influences .. and it bore a major title:, followed by more than one description according to the historical era .. that dealt with the story of life before the age of dinosaurs, followed by b, then, and finally this is the exact historical arrangement of the series, not the release date. the most important and most successful parts of the era were the dinosaurs, especially since it appeared in the era known to those interested in the field of fossils as the awakening of the second dinosaurs, which was started by a group of modern scientific discoveries that turned our attention completely towards these wonderful creatures. the new animation movie shares the l series in the name, production and subject matter, but it differs artistically in everything from what was presented brilliantly in the past. with hollywood as a 20th century fox studio enters as a major production partner, the whole business has gone completely wrong. in the original series we watched a fascinating display of the daily life of dinosaurs, from their debut timidly more than a million years ago, through their full domination of the jurassic era, and ending with their great extinction in the cretaceous period a million years ago. all this with an informed, educated, and informative voice commentary, uniquely blending science and art and imagination. everyone was waiting for the new movie to go in the same way, but it might take it to broader horizons and horrific stages .. especially with the development of technology it has become possible to provide dinosaurs as we have not seen them before .. in the film, we follow the huge annual migration of a flock of th bakirinosaura, a herbaceous dinosaur with a long skull spanning four prehistoric northern regions of canada. the scenario was destined to show the events in the style of al, that is, a documentary film in a narrative cinematic form .. we were supposed to watch this natural epic in a sober documentary worthy of it. this is before the producers finally change their minds and take the movie in a completely different direction that will remind you of the ridiculous cartoon movies we see on tv, especially those aimed at children as young as years old. fox of the twentieth century, producer of the film in the last stages of production, changed its plan from a discreet documentary with a fictional character to a family film intended mainly for children, and for this made all the animals in the film speak .. and the result was: complete failure. a hybrid movie that you cannot enjoy its seriousness, nor are you able to indulge in its humor, especially with provocative sounds .. instead of seeing dinosaurs interacting with each other through roaring, snarling, bellows, and loudness ... we were forced to listen to disturbing conversations that did not stop for one moment throughout the events .. add to this that the animals&#39; mouths never move, just listen to their thoughts. a group of young hollywood actors was chosen with voices without distinction and does not offer any pleasure justin long in the lead role. the dialogue itself was written in a very disturbing way ... with a very contemporary american joke and ... which will make you wonder: is this what is going on in the minds of prehistoric dinosaurs? it is the most ridiculous thing that you can see at all .. and to torture further, the filmmakers did not make their dialogue stop for a second to breathe or ease the viewer&#39;s mind, but it continued to be sticky, silly, and annoying throughout the events of the film even in the most dramatic moments ... which it will make you ascetic in the first third hour, and you will try hard to dampen the sounds in your head in any way and enjoy the image only, but without any success in reality. now what about the soundtrack accompanying the events? which is supposed in a movie that shows one of the most important major migrations that took place in history to be epic, or at the very least poetic, that puts you in the air that does not take you away from it .. but hey .. here you will listen to a group of the most ridiculous contemporary american songs that vary between rock, pop, and hip-hop .. and let the air go to hell .. let&#39;s spoil this to everyone in every possible way. one thing you&#39;ll enjoy in the movie is the stereoscopic show ... the one that came out very solid, and very cool. otherwise, you will come out of the theater with a strong headache, and the remnants of disturbing sounds that keep coming inside your head .. the movie has met with a huge failure in theaters, especially with fierce competition with other animation films that provided real art as your example, where he has achieved so far within america a million only dollars. all in all, i have taken the wonderful hollywood l that everyone loved and turned it into something ridiculous and very vulgar, this is a movie that will not love more children in dinosaurs, but may make them wander with love and feel the absurdity of their unique hobby. special advice: do not go for a walk with the dinosaurs in the theater .. and if you want to see another wonderful movie about dinosaurs going on in the same place prehistoric alaska, and deals with the same types of dinosaurs, but with a great deal of greatness and splendor, i recommend you the amazing documentary. or you can wait a little while the movie&#39;s blu-ray is released, a version of it will be available without those ridiculous sounds, and also with accompanying different soundtracks .. only then, you will be able to enjoy your dinosaurs dearly as it should, if you are obsessed with it like me.

"i admit that the novel attracted me even that i read it in one session and it amounts to more than four hundred pages, but i have some notes on it: i did not like political guidance throughout the lines of the novel. the writer insists on polishing marxism through several pivotal figures in the life of the heroine of the story, such as the slave of the prison fellow, for example. mr president . the stories and pornography are redundant, and the author described parts of the women’s bodies that are repeated many times ... the portent of marwa, the husband of the minority son of the minority, and the army officer who refused orders to raise the boy&#39;s childhood companion to attack the prison of palmyra. the army that is used to plunge into dangerous battles, to win over the rogue sect in this naive way will not do anything, i think that if the writer had been able to write the story in these days, i would reconsider this character ... digression or inherited my extreme boredom, writer digression plus and i noticed that he speaks about side stories almost ten sik the main story in what i imagined was an increase in the pages of the novel, no more. companionship in prison affected the heroine to a point that made her turn a degree in her thoughts and beliefs, so she left the prayer in prison and left it without a veil and no longer cares about him, just as she became drinking alcohol, all this effect is irrational to make her endure in prison all this time, because who believes in his ideas he is fiercely defended by whoever is able to remain in prison, whatever his orientation, while giving up ideas so easily it foretells of a defeated character who cannot continue to live life ... from racism and ridiculous stereotypes that islamist women are portrayed with the image of the neglected woman for herself and her beauty, as the heroine was not caring for herself and for her appearance when she was in the group and after her release from prison she became concerned with her elegance and body. another digression that i did not see any reason for is the story of the afghan-soviet war, which was reflected in the story on the character of safa and her husband abdullah ... it seems that the writer owns a good ignorance of islamic movements when he writes that the heroine of the story owns books by ibn baz that she considered references to her knowing that she belongs the organization of the muslim brotherhood and the two groups have great differences. it bothered me that the author did not mention the heroine’s name or her mother’s name ..

"i couldn&#39;t comment on the whole book just to name a few. what i liked about the book is its idea and it accepts the writer to search for the truth and research in other religions and not accepting the idea of this is what our father found ... some weaknesses. the first thing in the book started to liken some religions placed in the islamic religion and the convergence of their ideas and likeness of the greek gods to the angels, which makes islam the object of doubt to those who ask him himself .. another point is that the writer was blaming the atheists by attacking the religious and describing them as naive while the writer does not find any embarrassment by describing the atheists as arrogance and foolishness and foolishness and imitating them with animals that you don&#39;t agree with. the writer&#39;s view of scientific theories is not that of a researcher for four years. rather, he was repeating what the common people repeat about the big bang and development. he finds that evolution is apes transformed into a human being. many believers believe in the accuracy of these scientific theories because they basically do not contradict the existence of the creator. they only explain how things happen without reference to the existence of a creator or not .. at first, the writer rejects the theory of the big bang and then inferred from the qur&#39;an on the validity of this theory? have they not seen those who disbelieve that the heavens and the earth were slavery, and we have separated them? in a number of chapters, the author has interpreted the qur’an according to the likes of most interpretations he wrote, for which no source has been written. i do not think that the qur’an is a literary or scientific book in which you search for and interpret the facts according to what befits you or what you find appropriate for islam to defend. some verses, such as the creation of the fetus, have a scholarly dispute over it, and placing it as a miracle without clarifying the scholarly dispute that may offend religion more than it raises it. another point concerning science and religion is that some scientific hypotheses invalidate over time. science is in constant development and modernization. does this make the qur’an questionable? or, it is insulting in religion when some people decide to link the qur’an to the scientific miracles .. even at the end of the book, the writer clarifies some verses and links them and their interpretation to the liking of the reader so that he did not agree with them that the qur’an mentioned faith in the constellations. this is the conclusion of modifying texts for personal purposes. in another chapter, the author regrets the situation of women in europe during the dark ages, and i would like to see him describe the condition of women in the current islamic era. and put this point as if it defects christianity. if his measure of religion is with the hardening that is taking place, then it is more important to consider that isis represents the true islam. what you refuse to your religion do not blame the debt of others. likewise, christian militants treated women deservingly, and the extremists of islam treated them similarly. the writer believes that underdevelopment in europe at the time was due to religious beliefs and churches. does he now likewise believe that the cause of underdevelopment in the middle east is religious beliefs and mosques? the writer also mentioned that the woman’s physical desire outweighs the man and he did not mention any scientific source that proves it. if this information is correct, it will cancel one of the main reasons for legalizing marriage by four, which is to protect the man from engaging in forbidden relationships. as a matter of first, it is permissible to marry four women. in conclusion, the book was different from the best-selling books of these years. i think it deserves an opportunity to read it even if it is not accurate in its content or is broad in other sciences.

"i am still asking myself to the extent that i read it, why? . you may attract me in the first when i knew that the heroine of the story is dumb and that he loves her and wants to marry her. it can be imagined at the time that he would stand his mother’s economy and convince her of his love for his dumb cousin. and convince her that the fact that she is dumb, he will not be hindered by anything that she is a wife and a mother. however, the exact opposite happened, and hattan surrendered from his first tour with his mother. also, i do not know, or are i unable to imagine how muslim people would analyze themselves forbidden? do these things have nothing to do with islam? it is possible that i liked only the novel haneen, despite her handicap, not that she was strong and did not sit with her hand on her cheek, waiting for the return of hattan to her. but with the first opportunity for her to marry, she got married and left him as he left her. in short, the novel spoke more about the love of the body than the love of the soul and has a disgusting need. very good:",Negative,Negative,0.89447665
