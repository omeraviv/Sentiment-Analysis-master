"as a child of the 80's, i have seen rubik's cubes of all shapes, colors, and sorts.  i've never been particularly good at them, but i always like to pretend.  i was sent this innovative version of the rubik's cube for free from the manufacturer to review.  when i first took it out of the plastic bag, i was a bit shocked.  it was covered in a slimy thin greasy film that got all over my fingers.  it was like some sort of machine oil to keep it slick.  whatever it was, it took me a long time to wipe it off.  it was really gross.once i got it clean, i played with the mechanism some.  as promised, it is a lot smoother than the original rubik's cube.  i liked the bright colors and the fact that they are not stickers but rather colored blocks.  it seemed like would be a lot of fun it even includes a velvet storage bag.unbeknownst to me, my son noticed the cube on my desk of items &#34;to be reviewed&#34; and took it upon himself to try to solve the puzzle.  somehow he ended up popping out some of the cubes.  once a few came loose, it was a cascade of loose plastic parts.  i am trying but i can't figure out how all of these things go back together again.so it's greasy when you get it and breaks easily.  i'd recommend you pass or just get the original rubik's cube.note: i received a free sample for the purposes of review.",Negative, 0.2692307692307693,good like pretend innovative free shocked greasy like slick time clean promised smoother original liked bright like fun loose loose greasy breaks easily recommend original free,Negative
"my boy hasn&#8217;t become a thomas the train fanatic yet, so maybe that&#8217;s why he is not that much into this toy. he just doesn&#8217;t care.from my perspective, and after evaluating and playing with many toys, i find this toy, simply put, a waste of money. it has an extremely limited ability to entertain a child for a long time, it doesn&#8217;t encourage creativity or even multiple use. there is nothing to this train set bit just sliding the train down a slide. and there is a dinosaur. you can have additional fun if you buy more trains.the assembly was easy, although the instructions are very poor, especially the drawings.i would definitely rather invest into some melissa and doug or b toys instead. they actually think about children while creating their toys instead of just pushing merchandise.",Negative, 0.36363636363636365,fanatic many waste limited entertain time encourage creativity fun easy poor,Negative

"with three young girls at home, one being a huge monster high fan, the kids were quite excited and had high hopes for this playset.  after getting a lecture from my 8 year old on the difference between monster high and ever after high and the origins of briar beauty, i realized i was in over my head and just moved onto the assembly portion on the set.assembly for me took just under 20 minutes.  i had no specific issues except i did not realize the ""spine"" of the book was actually a storage area where the bed was stored.  also, the railing at the very top of the set was missing in my set, or it is hidden well enough that i never found it.  while i did not spend any time playing with the set, my impression of the set was not very favorable.  to me, the set seemed flimsy and not very sturdy.  i then turned it over to my three children to test.8 year old:  my eight year old really liked the doll and accessories.  however, they specifically said that they thought the house ""was a mess"".  they also commented that it was hard to get the mask on the doll.  they gave the set 3 stars, attributing most of the rating toward the doll, which they loved.10 year old:  their exact words are ""i wouldn't give this as a present to anyone.""  they hated the fact the dj stand in the house was made out of paper and they felt the set would not withstand any significant usage.  they also mentioned they thought the hands pop off the doll real easy.  they gave the set 1 star.6 year old:  similar to my 10 year old, my 6 year old did not like the fact the dj stand was made out of paper.  they commented that it was really hard to get the doll in the dj stand and have the dj stand keep the right shape.  they only gave the set 1 star as well.personally, i do think the set feels cheap and i am disappointed that it came missing a piece.  i will give the set some kudos for the overall design, how the bed is stored, and how compact the set can become for storage.  however, i was just not impressed with the execution of the idea.  if i had paid the current price of $49.99, i would have felt a little ripped off.  i would give the set 3 stars, but i am deducting a star for the missing piece, giving the set a rating of 2 stars.after having the set for several weeks, it pretty much sits on the side unplayed with.  my children also got thebarbie sisters life in the dreamhouse camperaround the same time and that playset is still being used on a daily basis while this one collects dust.averaging all our ratings together, as a family, we gave the set a mean rating of 1.75 stars which i will round up to 2 stars.",Negative, 0.26829268292682923,young huge monster excited monster beauty moved issues top well enough time favorable flimsy sturdy liked mess hard give hated significant real easy like hard right cheap disappointed give kudos compact impressed idea ripped give giving pretty life time still family,Negative

"i applaud mattel's marketing department for trying to make this embarrassingly simple game seem ~t0t@lly @w3s0m3~ but ultimately it is exactly what you think it is: ping pong balls and a connect four board.the concept is as follows: you draw a card with a pattern on it. you try to create the pattern by bouncing balls into the grid. the first one to land the pattern wins. yay!as is the case when you intentionally bounce ping pong balls, they have a tendency to go everywhere. unlike actual connect four, you will be spending 90% of the time chasing after the rouge balls. expert ball bouncers may find the game slightly more rewarding if they are consistently able to keep the balls on the board.i will offer some praise to the grid itself, which does have a fairly high success rate at landing the ball into a slot. as long as you don't hit one of the separator pegs (which is very likely) the ping pong ball will land easily into place. it's also a game that is easy to learn and teaches some skills that may translate to a higher angry birds score.according to the box, this game allows up to 4 players. i'm assuming if you have 4 players it has to be teams of two, however, because otherwise the game would be impossible (there are only two colors of balls and some patterns require 5-balls to complete).overall: this game is exactly as fun as you would expect, or probably less than you would expect. the game of throwing balls into grids is not original. i've seen the game at fairs and amusement parks plenty of times. the difference, however, is the size of the board. if the board were twice as large or even larger, it would be significantly more exciting and would reduce the likelihood of the ball going wild across the room. ultimately bounce off is one of those games that will be played with for approximately 30 minutes and then hidden away in the dark corners of a closet for many years until finally being donated to the local good will.",Negative, 0.19230769230769232,applaud embarrassingly simple connect create wins connect time rewarding consistently able praise fairly success easily easy learn angry impossible fun original exciting wild dark many good,Positive

"spending much of my youth in oregon, my grandparents felt that it was important that i be active in school , sports and various other community events when opportunity arose. my grandfather was an eagle scout thanks to a real bald eagle foot a native american friend of the family gave to him for his birthday. truth be told, he wasn't really a ""native american"" per say, but was really a die hard washington d.c. redskins fan. he was one of the fairest redheads i'd ever seen. he had access to all sorts of wildlife at the archery shop he ran.with no scouting programs available in the area, grandfather insisted that i be involved in similar activities to help my development. as a substitution, a popular camping program to teach life skills was run in our area by nambla.a community outreach program of grown men, many of whom just got out of prison, actively engaged in the nurturing relationship of young boys.  it was the perfect program for boys in search of good mentorship when they had no father figures. in my case, my grandfather due to his frail condition, camping would have been far too much of a hardship on him. besides, he didn't want to miss back to back episodes of `barney miller'. something he could not do with zero reception up in the mountains.  it was 'his' show that  he would watch regardless of where he was.  one time, grandma's bowels were acting up and she needed to be rushed to the hospital. on the way to the hospital it hit seven o'clock. after frantically driving around downtown in the rain, he pulled the car over and watched the show from the other side of the window of a closed television repair shop.grandma didn't make it that night, but i tend to believe it that it was simply her time to go.on one of the nambla campouts, i became lost in the midnight game of pajama hide and seek. the purpose was to pair the ""fathers"" up with the boys for the weekend.  it was one of the more popular games since it involved pajamas, but this particular night simply did not go well. in fact, because the boys outnumbered the ""fathers"" no one came looking for me that night. as a result, i spent the night lost in the woods and fell asleep by a fallen tree.sometimes, i would hear footsteps or hear rapid heavy breathing, but i did could not see anything. i thought that it was a predator watching over me since they would not harm kids.when i woke up in the morning, it turned out i was only about thirty feet from the camp site, but i simply did consider going in that direction.  i thought the bright lights were for the dog kennel that was along the fence that surrounded our campsite. those dogs scared me and i did not want to be near them.what did happen was that the good men of nambla did in fact go looking for me that night, but several of them became lost themselves and ended up sleeping in the woods or their vans. to think of the sacrifices they made on my behalf really brought me comfort that morning.i ended up going home that day ""father(less)"" but never forgetting the valuable lesson i learned from being lost.  sometimes, it is best to not give up so easily when it gets dark.this figure serves as a reminder of that frightful night spent alone in the woods while a mysterious predator watched over me.",Negative, 0.3272727272727273,youth important active community opportunity real friend family truth die hard available involved help popular teach life community many prison engaged nurturing young perfect good frail hardship miss time frantically time goon lost purpose popular involved well lost fell fallen rapid harm direction bright scared good lost comfort valuable lost best give easily frightful mysterious,Negative
"to be honest, i was on the fence about this predator figure. taking into account, it is simply another repaint and branded as something near doctrinally correct based off of the mega online blockbuster film ""batman:dead end"" by paul w.s. anderson. i just was not sure i needed a yellow predator figure in my collection.amazon prime often lives above and beyond their great name when i get packages in one day instead of two (i can't wait for the amazon drones to deliver within ...wait for it...hours!!!) as was the case here, my figure arrived the following day upon ordering it. it was there while i was sitting on the couch on my front yporch drinking sugar-free lemonade when the fedex man dejuan arrived. he is good at his job, but on a personal level i'm not really keen on him since he's run over several of my coon dogs with his truck. since i run little hunting ""tours"" for boring office guys who live in the north, those dogs are part of my livelihood. it is hard to tell if he is in a hurry, or just tired of stopping at my place one to two times a day. my dogs seems to like him though, often times, they will hug his bare leg or chase his truck as he drives off.then, it hit me.the reason why i was on the fence about it is because of the name ""wasp"" the predator figure has.when i was growing up, my parents were very strict religious people. my mom was dutifully supportive of my dad's freelance revival tours he did. preaching the good word from the same book. all in all, he made really good money at it. even his motivational cassette tape series turned quite a profit.as ""great"" as he was on stage, tape or to other people, he was extremely hard on us kids. he was very firm, but also very fair. his punishments were always proportionately based on the the offense and we could choose which punishment we would receive. no one ever thought to question his punishments since it was a higher will that utilized him as an instrument for righteousness.one sunday during an after church family picnic where we would gather around on the ground and dad would eat all the food we prepared for him and read for hours from the good book to us. i started get restless and began pestering one of my sisters. dad would have none of that once he saw i had interrupted his sermon. he slammed the book shut, got up, marched straight over to me, grabbed my arm and was about to give me a spanking in right front of my family.then, one of sisters spoke up and told him it was still sunday.bless her heart.he never gave out spankings on sunday. instead, he grabbed me by the ear and marched me over to a nearby log. there he made me abruptly sit down to think about my sinful ways until he told me i could get up.no exceptions.what i did not see (i'm not sure if he did or not) was a yellow jacket was on the spot where i was forcefully sat down. i really wanted to say something, but ""no exceptions"" meant just that.no exceptions.i do not recall how long i was on the log for, could of been hours since the good book is a pretty big book, but i do remember coming to in the emergency room surrounded by most of my family. it turned out, i had a bad reaction to the yellow jacket sting on my bottom.a memory i tried to forget, but once seeing this figure in hand brought it all back.one star.",Negative, 0.3076923076923077,honest correct blockbuster beyond great drones good keen boring live hard tired like hug reason strict supportive revival good good motivational great hard fair family food good restless give right still abruptly sinful good pretty emergency family bad sting,Negative

"these alleged &#8220;learning activities&#8221; are framed within three alleged &#8220;mysteries&#8221; in which the player has to complete the activities in order to earn &#8220;clues&#8221;.  the first mystery involves missing shoes, the second involves missing rhinestone items and i haven&#8217;t worked up the gumption to plow through the third mystery.  each mystery has ten sections, and at the completion of all sections the &#8220;clues&#8221; are jigsaw pieces which assemble to show the culprit.  before, after and in between each section you are subjected to inane babble between barbie and one of her perfect-looking friends.the &#8220;learning activities&#8221; are, at best, only tangentially related to the &#8220;mystery&#8221;.  in one activity you have to find the &#8220;hidden&#8221; items.  except that the items are sitting in plain view.  there are several &#8220;hidden items&#8221;, but you are only instructed to find three.  afterwards, you have to sort the names of the items, along with similar words, into columns.  for instance, if the hidden items were a star, a cup and a crown, you might have to sort those three words, along with pup, gown, car, down, bar and sup into matching columns.another activity comes when barbie goes to interview someone.  the activity involves picking out what the character is &#8220;thinking&#8221;.  there are three objects floating in mid-air and you may be instructed to pick one that starts with the &#8220;h&#8221; sound, for instance.  i often found it difficult to adequately hear the letter sound as pronounced by the game, but it&#8217;s still not terribly hard as two of the three objects start with the correct letter sound.other activities involve inserting the proper letters to complete the given words and other sorts of spelling activities (one such activity involves printing t-shirts &#8211; go figure).  the game comes loaded with many words already, and you can also upload your child&#8217;s spelling words.  as with all of the activities, the difficulty of the words increases or decreases based on your child&#8217;s performance.in addition to the mysteries, there is also a &#8220;map&#8221; which will allow you to travel around and do other activities, but they are all very similar to the ones listed above.my kids and i all found these activities very repetitive and boring after a few rounds.  it was a chore to complete enough activities to get the &#8220;clues&#8221; to solve the mysteries.  and the solution is not exactly earth-shaking when it comes.  if you&#8217;ve paid even passing attention to barbie and her friends&#8217; inane chatter, you&#8217;ve long since figured it out.furthermore, these activities really aren&#8217;t &#8220;educational&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s just a ploy for companies to get dedicated parents to spend lots of hard-earned money to &#8220;enrich&#8221; their children&#8217;s education.  the young and developing brain is not hard-wired to acquire literacy through these drill-and-repeat sorts of exercises, especially through electronic media.  if you really want to develop your child&#8217;s literacy, blocks, legos, play-doh, boardgames and other sorts of toys are far better for developing pre-literacy skills.  and, of course, the best way for children to actually learn to read is to read actual books with a parent or other fluent reader.  if you want your child to be a good reader, let them learn to love reading so they&#8217;ll do a lot of it.",Negative, 0.42500000000000004,order mystery worked gumption mystery mystery culprit subjected inane babble best difficult still terribly hard start correct involve proper many difficulty addition allow repetitive boring chore enough inane chatter ploy dedicated education young better best learn fluent good learn love,Negative

"for starters i would like to mention this is not my fist experience with k'nex products. in the past i have ordered a couple mario kart sets for my kid, as well as some kiss and the beatles yellow submarine figurine sets. my experience with the brand had been great so as a fan of family guy, i did not hesitate to order this. i would love to tell you the experience was great but i am afraid i can't, this set was so frustrating that my kid simply did not care about finishing it, nor did i.the first problem i encountered was the instructions, we have plenty of lego sets (which my kid loves) and we have never struggled with the instructions like we did with this one. the manual tries to differentiate the pieces you need to add from the ones you already added by using red and gray colors; the problem is, there are gray pieces, so there was a point in which we skipped two pieces because of this. as you can see, the top of the car is a red cardboard, as odd as that was for me, i expected some kind of hard material that could make this more durable and was disappointed when i found the cover to be a very flimsy piece of cardboard.if this was not enough, the design has very notorious structural flaws, when we were putting it together i kept wondering how this would stand together once completed, the answer? it simply doesn't. when the time came to add the cover to the top of the car, it broke into pieces. at that point, my kid had lost any interest and left me there with a broken set. stubborn as i am, i kept trying to figure out a way to put it together, i was finally able to, only for it to break again.so, save your money and get a lego set instead; true, they do not have the family guy license, but even as a collector this set is not worth it. for some reason, k'nex included a peter griffin figure wearing a gray suit instead of his characteristic green pants and white shirt&#8230; wait, k'nex does have that figure, in a sold-separately set&#8230; i see what they did there...",Negative, 0.37777777777777766,like fist experience well kiss experience great family order love experience great afraid frustrating care problem loves struggled like add problem top odd kind hard durable disappointed flimsy enough notorious flaws time add top broke lost interest broken stubborn able break save family worth reason,Negative
"i'm a fan of k'nex and appreciate the original designs they've come up with using their beam and joint pieces, especially their large roller coasters. this model attempts something more lego-like and the result is perpetual frustration for kids (and any adults swept into the effort). the directions for the build don't have the clarity of lego directions, and the design itself has a large number of weak joints that result in frequent structural collapse. adding to the problem is the fact that the bricks don't have the same gripping power as lego bricks. i also don't like the use of cardboard for the roof of the car. i find it humorous that the peter figure comes fully assembled when there are directions for assembling him, and placing him in the car requires that he be taken apart anyway. i don't quite understand the intended audience for the toy. i'm not a prude and i introduce above-age material to my kids all the time, but i can't imagine a toy company seriously thinking that family guy is appropriately paired with 8 year olds. our set was missing one piece, but we had it in our supply of k'nex so that was a non-issue. in the end, i would only recommend this toy to a die-hard fan of family guy, someone who is happy displaying the car and not playing with it.",Negative, 0.25,appreciate original frustration clarity weak collapse problem power like humorous understand time family recommend family happy,Negative

(everything is light/gray except the pieces you are putting together.)  this did become a challenge though when you had a gray piece to add, we had actually missed it in the instructions and had to go back, which is common anyway in building detailed pieces.  the low score rating is actually for the knex pieces themselves.  when we got half way through the project it became very unstable.  the pieces didn't fit tightly and the project often fell a part.  we actually put it away at one point because we were both getting frustrated that the piece kept coming a part (which was often done by me, the adult and not the 5 year old).  i probably will stick to lego's brand unless a kit comes up with knex that looks exciting.",Negative, 0.2857142857142857,fun excited new understood liked better challenge add missed unstable fit fell frustrated exciting,Negative
"i've played with k'nex construction sets in the past with the kidlets - most recently put together a suspension bridge and they are fun.  however, in this particular incarnation, k'nex is trying to be like legos, and they failed miserably.apparently the k'nex people didn't realize that the same people who buy legos would be attracted to this product due to its similarities and didn't pay attention to how clearly the lego instructions are laid out.  with the k'nex instructions (all graphics, no words) it wasn't clear if you were supposed to use two of one item or if the arrow between the items meant that you were moving the piece in that direction.  it wasn't clear if you were using two really tiny pieces or one tiny piece in certain sections.  i am the family instruction reader so i know good instructions from bad, and these could have been much clearer graphically.one of the main problems, though, was that the blocks didn't lock together very tightly in instances when they had to overlap rather than be exactly on top of one another, and the design didn't allow for reinforcement of those weak spots, as the lego constructs are designed to do.  we never actually got the car fully put together because it would break in half before we could put the top section on; after five attempts we just gave up on it.i would reiterate the manufacturer's warning about a choking hazard.  there are a lot of very small pieces in this kit that would be dangerous to small children.  and some of those pieces were very tiny and easy to drop.  it didn't seem as though the package contained any extra pieces to possibly compensate for those that might drop and disappear in carpets.i have to agree with the other reviewers that it was amusing that the there were instructions for assembling the peter character, when he came fully assembled, and that in order to place him within the car you have to remove the lower half of his body.  i don't watch the tv show ""family guy"" so i can't comment on whether a toy based on that program is age-appropriate; to me it was just a k'nex toy that i thought the kidlets might like.so, in summary, don't waste your money.  while the plastic pieces appear to be well-made, the same care wasn't taken in the creation of the instructions or the interlocking design for the car.  if you can't actually make it stay together, it's rather useless and becomes just an exercise in frustration.  as the kidlets told me to tell you folks, ""this one gets a bad review"".",Negative, 0.375,fun like failed clearly clear moving direction clear family good bad clearer problems top allow weak break top warning hazard dangerous easy extra agree amusing order family waste care useless frustration bad,Negative

"all my life, i've been a dinosaur freak! i have purchased any manner of dinosaur related product, both for myself and as gifts. when i was offered this set of twelve jumbo dinosaurs, the kid in me simply had to have them (i won't bore you with details about my toy collection)! despite my passion for the subject, however, i am also a firm believer in the concept of truth in advertising. and while this is a perfectly acceptable set of creatures, it does not live up to the billing.cons:1) these were labeled as jumbo and, in no way, could you construe this set as oversized. at best, the average creature falls into a 3"" by 4"" range. they are not tiny, but certainly not jumbo.2) the set of twelve includes four duplicates. this wouldn't bother me if they were the same dinosaur in a different pose, but they are exact replicas. in essence, therefore, you've got eight different dinosaurs as opposed to the listed twelve. they claim at least 11 dinosaurs may be included in the assortment (or as few as 6). if 11 different models are made, why not have each represented in a package?3) the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. the toys are just placed into an unremarkable plastic bag without even a proper label. if you are looking for gift quality toys, this would fall short of my expectations.truthfully, though, none of these things is a real deal-breaker for me. i just don't like advertising that doesn't truly represent the product and i believe the listing should be amended. i did like the eight different dinosaurs provided. they were made from a good and detailed mold and are solidly constructed. despite each having the same goofy grin, they were nice representations.pros:1) primarily, there is very good detail in the molding.were it not for the variance in description versus actual product, i would have ranked this more highly. as is, though, these eight dinosaurs are nice but not accurately represented by the product listing. kgharris, 4/14.note: i was offered a sample of this product in which to provide an honest review.",Negative, 0.23076923076923078,life freak bore passion truth perfectly acceptable live best falls bother proper gift quality fall real like like good goofy grin nice good nice accurately honest,Negative

"deal breaker appears to be the type of game whose target audience could be the twenty something crowd. when the twenty something guy in my family came over looking to see if we had an actual yahtzee game, i showed him this one. it was an immediate turnoff and he wasn&#8217;t one bit interested. i think that the 18+ age range for the game is probably necessary for screening because some of the deal breaker cards are some you wouldn&#8217;t want your young teen to read. the age group for which this game is intended, is simply not interested. they are looking for &#8220;the one&#8221; and this game, well ... it&#8217;s a bit too immature.the premise of the game is to have the other players (you need at least three) to figure out what might be a &#8220;deal breaker&#8221; for you in a relationship. there are a couple of stacks of coaster-sized cards (4&#8221; x 4&#8221;), red ones that are labeled &#8220;deal breaker&#8221; and the green ones that say &#8220;all good.&#8221; the youngest player goes first. there are two scenarios on each card. perhaps everything is all good with the world or one of these scenarios could be a deal breaker. in other words, it&#8217;s goodbye time to the relationship. each person selects one random card from each deck.it you are the focus, you listen to the person read one of the scenarios from one of their cards. would this scenario be a deal breaker for you or all good? you can slide a card that indicates your choice on to the table. if you think all would be well with the scenario and this imaginative person could be &#8220;the one,&#8221; you&#8217;d place your all good card face down (colored side down) on the table. the other players will have to guess what you are thinking and place one face down as well. scoring goes according to how the guessing goes.these coasters, which remind me of bar coasters are pretty much the same quality. cheap, disposable, and probably wouldn&#8217;t last with a lot of use. the questions are rather silly for the twenty something crowd, but would probably titillate teens who might snag them. the twenty somethings i know are trying to disconnect somewhat from the high-tech world around them and get back down to earth with games they may have played from their childhood. not ones like party until you puke, but rather the good old standards like monopoly, yahtzee, or parcheesi. the idea of zobmondo&#8217;s deal breaker is interesting, but falls short of what their target audience is looking for. i&#8217;ll tap out a few random deal breaker scenarios so you&#8217;ll get the idea. not recommended because my twenty something took one look at it and pretty much dissed it.deal breaker scenarios:&#9658; &#8220;you are on a first date together and your date says the price of your menu selections and then whistles under their breath ...&#8221;&#9658; &#8220;you are on your first date with someone who is smoking hot but has a missing tooth, which is really obvious when they talk.&#8221;&#9658; &#8220;you are on your fifth date and things are going great, except your partner is a horrible kisser and doesn&#8217;t seem to be improving.&#8221;&#9658; &#8220;you are on a first date and the person is amazing. they&#8217;ve recently dyed their hair bright purple and they say they love it.&#8221;&#9658; &#8220;you&#8217;ve been on a few dates and really like the person when you notice that your partner has freakishly huge hands.&#8221;",Negative, 0.17948717948717946,family interested young interested well good time focus good choice well imaginative good well pretty quality cheap silly titillate snag like good like idea interesting falls idea recommended pretty dissed hot great horrible amazing bright love like freakishly huge,Positive

"my son is a bit too young to play with the matchbox mission: croc escape playset so i took the opportunity to try this toy out with my 9yr old nephew recently and gauge his reaction and fun with the toy. the playset is designed for children 3-10.the very first thing you have to know is that adult assembly is required. though my nephew was able to help me out it still took a solid 10-15 minutes to get the set assembled. my first impression wasn't great - the track is rather large and cumbersome and seemingly not very well made. the highlight is definitely the die-cast off-road truck that comes with the set. but this set only includes one vehicle. the other major detraction is that the toy doesn't break down easily for storage. my son's closet includes several large deep drawers that we use to store toys. this playset is entirely too large for those and has to be stored in his room on the floor.for its size the set has limited fun potential. there is a car elevator to ascend a set of jungle stairs, the ramp with a few obstacles/traps and then the crocodile jaws which can clamp shut and trap the die-cast truck. that's it. for the price of the set i understand that there are limitations but by itself this toy is extremely limited in its entertainment value. there are additional tracks and cars that can be purchased and build on each other but at added expense.for my nephew this was an interesting diversion for about 10 minutes before he wanted to do something else. my advice is to pass on this toy unless you're looking to build out a large set with multiple vehicles.",Negative, 0.30434782608695654,young play opportunity fun able help still solid great cumbersome well major detraction break easily limited fun trap understand limitations limited value interesting,Negative

"okay - who doesn't like pictionary?  sadly, this game doesn't live up to it's predecessors.as a side note - there is no storage box for this product.  the product is packaged in clam shell plastic and once removed, you have a 2 piece yellow and white storage base (for the playing cards, die, timer, and marker) and the plastic clear frame that fits on top of the storage base.  if you're finicky about games always returning to the box you'll need to get over it as there is no storage box for the pieces.the timer only allows 30 seconds to draw the picture and have it guessed by the opposing team.  seriously - 30 seconds?  what kid (or adult for that matter) can produce a drawing and correctly guess the clue in that limited amount of time?  the timer is worthless and we resorted to using the timer on a cell phone rather than to keep flipping the timer over for more time.the marker provided is painfully inadequate.  it is very very light and does not provide crisp bold lines.  if you are interested in this game, you are better off using the neon dry erase markers (which show up great) or some other dry erase marker as the one provided can barely be seen (we used quartet glo-write neon markers and the enduraglide markers - both are for dry-eraser boards).  the provided marker (as well as our personal markers) leave the screen cloudy after it is cleaned.  you will need to really buff the screen with a damp cloth and then dry it before each use before moving onto the next team's turn.  since the screen doesn't clean quickly, this slows down the game.another downside to this game is that it is designed to be played in teams.  if you have only 2 kids - they will be unable to play it by themselves without significantly improvising the rules.  you'll therefore need 4 or more players to develop 2 teams.the difference in this game is that the playing cards are broken down into 3 categories:  action frame (draw the clue and use the frame to &#34;act&#34; out the clue), mirror/mirror (the person drawing the clue doesn't use the marker - they use their finger and the other team member uses the marker on the other side of the clear screen to trace their partner's finger to create the drawing), and classic (simply draw the picture - and your team provides guesses).  you roll the provided die, select the playing card of your choice and the number on the die outlines what clue you draw (roll a 6 and you pick from the 5 clues).  the first player who acquires one card of all three categories (action, mirror/mirror, and classic) wins.  opposing teams can challenge and win cards from their competitors by correctly guessing the answer after the time has run out.the age of play suggests 8 and above.  many of the clues are way out of the ballpark for kids that are younger.  for example, some of the clues for action include:  get sworn-in, grease the wheel, catch a greased pig, deliver a eulogy, etc.  clues for the mirror/mirror included:  comet, ladle, menorah, contact lens, and queen bee.  clues for classic included: ferret, goth, hair raiser, stumbling block, etc.  in other words, many of the clues are really difficult - and they expected you to draw these clues in 30 seconds.my kids (age 7 and 10) got bored very quickly and we often had to help explain what the clue was (which further complicated the game as the person helping obviously couldn't challenge and possibly steal the card since they already knew the answer).this game wouldn't be my first selection if i wanted to play pictionary.  if you are playing with adults - it will be very challenging.  if you want to include kids - it's almost impossible to keep their interest due to the frustration of trying to draw the difficult clues.if you choose to purchase this game, i would encourage you to definitely be open to modifying the rules (based upon age level playing) and replace the timer and the marker.",Negative, 0.3636363636363635,like sadly live die clear top finicky team correctly limited time worthless painfully inadequate light crisp interested better erase great erase well cloudy moving clean downside unable play broken action team clear create classic team die choice die action classic wins challenge win correctly time play many action pig classic many difficult bored help complicated helping challenge steal play challenging impossible interest frustration difficult encourage open,Negative
"how can you review a book you haven't read? that's my usual response when i read comments declaring why the reviewer didn't really make it through the entire book because of some major concerns.well, now i am reviewing something that i haven't fully tested.the pictionary frame game is a pretty unfortunate attempt to &#34;update&#34; an old classic game, but it fails on so many levels that we haven't ever been able to get a game going following the new instructions.problems start out with the drawing frame itself. as has already been pointed out, the lack of a game box is in itself awkward (still have this sitting on a shelf while trying to figure out how to store it), but this could be overlooked if the format of a stand up frame for drawing the game pictures worked.it doesn't.if you lay the frame on the table and draw on it for stability, it works, but then that takes away the advantage of everyone being able to see the picture as it is drawn. however, for most normally adept adults and children, trying to hold the frame steady while drawing on it in an upright position ends up making the drawings even more incoherent than they might normally be. add to that the small size of the frame, especially for those of us who have grown used to playing pictionary on whiteboards or even flipchart paper (yes, some of us have been known to go so far, especially when there are large groups playing), and you will begin to get the picture (pun intended) of the problems with this screen.now move on to one of the &#34;new&#34; kinds of cards--action. quite frankly, our crew tested a couple of these and realized that they could get better effects by laying down the marker and screen and just acting out the clues. anyone every hear of &#34;charades?&#34;then there is the mirror, mirror category. now the person who knows what is the clue will take his or her finger and &#34;draw&#34; on one side of the screen, while a teammate takes the marker and traces those finger movements, all the while that the rest of the team is trying to figure out what is being drawn. when we tried a test drive of this, there were very large problems, chief of which was trying to have two people do this while the rest of the group has enough visibility to even try to guess what is being drawn. and all this in 30 seconds or less.ah yes, another problem. thirty seconds to draw a picture? really? unless the group decides to let the draw-er spend an extended amount of time thinking of where they will start with the idea, this is sadly insufficient for almost any of the clues, especially (again) given the difficulty in drawing on an upright frame and having such a small screen that the entire team can't really see the drawing well at once.oh, and the marker is not &#34;dry-erase;&#34; it is &#34;wet erase&#34; (says so right in the instructions!), so you need to have a wet (not just lightly moist either) paper towel or cloth handy for wiping the screen between each use. better have a dry cloth too, unless you want to wait out the air drying time by singing songs or otherwise occupying your time.so why did i give this two stars? i guess i just couldn't go all the way to one star when we really never got to a full-blown game. and we will be pulling some of the cards and mixing them in with our classic pictionary game; in fact, trying this out reminded us of how long it had been since we'd played the original. yes, some of those clues are now a little dated, but we just go past those if they are a problem for any of the younger players. the screen (with real dry erase markers) is something that a few of the kids are having fun with, creating their own ideas of fun, so all is not lost...and we are still trying to come up with our own made up game that can use a 30 second timer, since the quality of that piece seems pretty good.overall, avoid this but, if you have it given to you as a gift, try to get creative in how you use all the parts!",Negative, 0.22807017543859648,major pretty unfortunate classic fails many able new start lack awkward still stability works advantage able steady incoherent add yes problems better rest team drive problems rest enough yes problem time start idea sadly insufficient difficulty team well right handy better air time give classic original yes problem real erase fun fun still quality pretty gift creative,Negative

"here&#8217;s a riddle for you:  what company name excites children merely by saying it; generates great expectations for both the giver and recipient of the gift; and keenly disappoints?  . . . . . . .(waiting for your answer)  give up?  it&#8217;s disney!  yup, i was surprised, too.this looked like a toy that&#8217;s a bit different from the rest; it involves racing airplanes.  but sadly, innovation ends with the concept.  i&#8217;ll explain.after following the directions, assembly was easy (adult required, but no batteries).  however, contrary to the directions, applying the decals prior to assembly is more practical.the toy is lightweight and rather flimsy.  rugged play will cause it to come apart at a portion of the track where two sections meet.  the airplane holds up just fine.seeing this toy in play reminds me of watching a hamster running on its wheel.  the hamster&#8217;s action doesn&#8217;t change; it does the same movement repeatedly.  boring!  the child playing with this toy repeats the same action&#8212;pulls back the lever, releases the lever, watches the plane circle track, repeat&#8212;ad nauseum.  and that&#8217;s it.  neither thinking nor creativity, nor imagination is required.  (as a parent and educator it rates an &#8216;f&#8217;, in my opinion.)  i would not waste my money on it nor, would i allow my child to play with such mindless tripe.  the box states that after 10 laps, the track opens up and the plane flies to the &#8216;finish&#8217;.  the only finish we see is the breaking of the track and the plane falling down.the box depicts a child playing with this set, clearly showing multiple aircraft and a truck.  in a prominent 2.5&#8221; circle it states, &#8220;fly 2 planes!&#8221;  however, the reality is that it contains one plane, one track and control tower.  there is no other plane.  the truck doesn&#8217;t exist.  in tiny print (font size of about a three or four) it states:  &#8220;vehicles and sets each sold separately.&#8221;  really??!  so, if your pre-schooler (who can&#8217;t read and relies on pictures) sees this toy and asks for it, s/he will be keenly disappointed once it&#8217;s opened and assembled.  adults buying this as a gift will probably not read the fine print either, thinking this is a wonderful present for a young child.i am annoyed by a couple of things.  first, disney&#8217;s representation of what&#8217;s inside the box is inaccurate.  second, with so many engaging play items on the market, money and time should not be wasted with this item.  disney&#8217;s name invokes imagination and good quality.  if this set is indicative of the company&#8217;s standards today, i will be wary of future disney products.",Negative, 0.25999999999999995,excites great gift keenly disappoints give disney surprised like rest sadly innovation easy flimsy play play action change movement boring creativity imagination waste allow play mindless breaking falling clearly prominent reality keenly disappointed gift fine wonderful young annoyed inaccurate many engaging play time wasted imagination good quality wary future disney,Negative

"the concept is slick at least - like a suspended roller coaster, and a shuttle that rides on the track.  it actually worked quite well for the three or so minutes my son was able to play with it.assembly is quick - 5 minutes, and it's assembled, another minute or so for stickers.  the lever movement is quite smooth, and pulling the lever spins an arm on the track that pushes against the shuttle, launching the plane along the track.it comes with two shuttles but only one plane.  fortunately we had a planes aircraft carrier that had another version of the plane with it that has the hole in the bottom so we had two planes right off the bat to run on this.  it can push two at once, but the prop on the rear got stuck in the tail assembly of the front one, so while they'd push, they were joined the whole run.  with good timing, you can get the one going, then drop the other from the top of the spiral, and get one flying behind the other and nudge each as it goes, keeping them both running separately.my son did enjoy it for a few minutes, but as with most toys like this, the enjoyment is limited since it gets old pretty quick.but worse than that, there's a small trigger on the bottom section that lowers the track, which is where you slide plane shuttles on or off the track.  you push it back up and the track locks into place until you press that trigger, which lets it drop again.  we used the trigger once, to open the track to put the planes on, then closed the track for use.  within a few minutes of normal use, without even touching the trigger again, it broke and the track won't stay &#34;closed&#34; anymore.the &#34;finish&#34; line part won't stay up on carpet, so if you want the planes to be able to knock that down, put this on a hard floor.they should've just used a twisting piece of plastic that turns under the piece of track that lowers, to hold it in place, rather than the mechanism they used.  then this couldn't happen.  meanwhile, this didn't even last for as many minutes as it took to assemble it.  i was watching him the whole time and know he didn't hit it or even bump it or do anything at all, nor did he overdo the handle for launching the planes.had it worked, it might've been worth it for the novelty, even if it wears off pretty quick, but i'll never recommend a toy that doesn't even last 5 minutes before breaking.",Negative, 0.25000000000000006,slick like worked well able play movement smooth fortunately right stuck whole good top enjoy like enjoyment limited pretty worse open broke able knock hard many whole time bump overdo worked worth novelty pretty recommend breaking,Negative

when the max steel turbo morph max steel figure came i was excited.  the packaging and the concept of the figure was great.  i couldn&#8217;t wait to let my nephew have at it&#8230;. my nephew was excited as well.  it took him a lot longer to open the package that i thought.  it took several minutes even with my assistance to get it removed.  the action figure was a little fragile and a one of the wings sustained slight damage during the unboxing.as the name suggest the max steel turbo morph max steel figure &#8220;transforms&#8221; from a winged humanoid into a futuristic fighter jet/ship.  it has a feature that seems very cool.  it safely shoots a missile.  the problem is that it comes with one missile and it took 20 minutes to figure out how to load the missile and get it fire.the instructions were less than useless.  i expected more from a historic toy maker like mattel.  this toy was put down in about 30 minutes (don't forget it took nearly 20 minutes to open and figure out how to use it).  it seems way more fun than it turned out to be&#8230; it would be great for a toy collector&#8230;but not so much fun to play with.,Negative, 0.2,excited great excited well open action fragile sustained damage futuristic cool safely problem useless like open fun great fun play,Positive

"this &#34;action&#34; figure was a bit of a disappointment. the concept is that steel the alien morphs into the combined flying hero max steel. fans of the transformers might be tempted to pick this one up, but fight that urge.to be clear, the idea of this figure is a good one. out of the box, max steel is in flight mode - ready to blast off into his many adventures. he really looks kind of cool. in the center of max's chest is a crank that brings the wings down and collapses the legs. this turns our human hero into the mechanical steel. then, in the center of the crank is a button that pops max back into flight mode.so what could be wrong with this cool transferring action figure ? well, a lot of the issues revolved around max and his spring-loaded weapon. it should be held in max's hand, but the flight mode wings really keep the arm from swiveling up to be parallel with the ground. as a result, max can only carry his rifle by the handle, as if it were a lunchbox. and then, in alien mode the gun pegs into the back of the robot. this doesn't seem like it should be bad at all. only, it plugs in right next to a handle, so that you can not use the handle to fly around the robot.if you only plan to play with max in flight mode, and not use his gun, its probably a good display piece. but this is a toy. it should be a lot of fun for kids to play with. but with all of the design flaws, one has to wonder how this thing passed quality assurance. at twenty dollars, kids (and collectors ?) deserve much better treatment from the nice folks at mattel.",Negative, 0.16129032258064516,disappointment hero fans clear idea good ready many kind cool human hero wrong cool action well issues like bad right play good fun play flaws wonder quality assurance deserve better nice,Positive

"we received this as an impromptu gift from grandma. let's start with the directions... or rather the lack thereof... the directions that came with this loom were so unclear and unhelpful that we did what everyone else does... go to youtube and watch a couple of how-to videos. well that's when we realized this is the knockoff. this loom is different from the original rainbow loom. the rainbow loom has the center row off-set. this loom has the three rows exactly the same. think of a tic tac toe board. they go straight across. there are also no ""arrows"" like on the rainbow loom. the directions that came with this told us to hook the bands straight up one row... and then what??? the videos on youtube clearly had the bands going zig-zagging. so we tried to zig zag as best we could with this loom.  quite difficult to do since the rows are not off-set like the original loom. so the bands were stretched to their fullest... but we did not get any breaking like the other reviewer.  but because we zig-zagged, this made the row shorter and the bracelet is not as long as it would have been with the original rainbow loom. yes, we got it... or rather grandma got it after re-watching the youtube video about 5 times. (wait 'til i tell my husband that we got his mother to use youtube!) now she's going to see if she can show my 8 year old daughter how to do it herself tomorrow morning (mommy wasn't watching closely enough since i was in the middle of something else).  but this will be just a temporary thing for us.  grandma had bought two of these looms (one for each daughter). after today, the decision was to return the unopened one and go to michaels and purchase the real rainbow loom and the girls will share.oh, and another difference was that this kit came with only 1 ""c"" hook... and about 30 hooks that i would call ""s"" hooks... hmmmmm.the only nice thing about this loom was that it did come with six charms to add onto the bracelets. we didn't have any issues with the bands like the other reviewer had.***************update 11/4/2013***************please note that i did change my review from 1 star to 2 stars.okay, i still stand by my review that this loom stinks.  however, i did want to point out that my daughter (8.5 yrs, 3rd grade) started bringing her loom in to school so she could make bracelets, etc. at recess with the other kids.  in doing so, one of the girls at recess was able to move the center row by taking the purple pieces at the bottom off, moving the row, and then putting the purple pieces back on... to be honest, i really don't know how.  when i tried to do it, i felt i wasn't strong enough (or talented enough) to do so... and couldn't. my daughter tried it at home too without success... but this one kid was able to do it. when i asked my daughter how, she replied that she just ""pulled hard"".  we chalked it up to the fact that maybe the kid was pretty strong (and persistent) b/c i still can't do it.so now that you can move the pegs to make it look like the ""real"" one, it's not so bad. by the time we figured out that the pegs could be moved, my daughter had received a new ""real"" rainbow loom from grandma in the mail.  so she mostly uses the real rainbow loom but sometimes uses this loom too.  this one still makes smaller bracelets though... even when you move the center row. i'm not sure why & i really don't feel like figuring out why either... just glad i didn't waste my money on this one even though it was probably cheaper. but it is nice to have a back-up loom for when two kids want to work on the loom and the other kid doesn't have one.as a result of now knowing that you can move the pegs, i did change it from 1 star to 2 stars... but it's still stinky just for the fact that it is soooooo difficult to do so. and it still makes smaller bracelets. and some of the rubber bands do break (but they are not horrible).  i still like the real ""rainbow loom"" much better.",Negative, 0.1805555555555556,gift start lack unclear unhelpful well original rainbow rainbow like rainbow clearly best difficult like original breaking like original rainbow yes enough real rainbow nice add issues like change still stinks able moving honest strong enough talented enough success able hard pretty strong still like real bad time moved new real rainbow real rainbow still like glad waste cheaper nice work change still difficult still break horrible still like real rainbow better,Positive

"this is the new game by the designer ofcaylus. like caylus, spyrium is boring and overly complicated, this time with a pasted-on steampunk theme that has absolutely no impact on gameplay and is done in the most dry, boring, academic way possible. this is a worker placement game where you bid to own different cards, each representing various character professions and buildings. some produce ""spyrium"" a florescent green new element that might as well be solar or electricity, that's how unexciting it is. due to the bidding on multiple sides of the cards mechanic, the game reminds me of the equally boring, even more complicatedkeyflower. the art is much nicer than keyflower, but the game's colors seem a bit muted and intentionally murky for a pseudo-industrial feel i didn't like. this game is hard to learn and teach, and goes too far away from the light fun of other worker placement games like stone age, hawaii, and lords of waterdeep. hardcore gamers who like dry, overly complicated euro-games may like this, but the average gamer will not. the steampunk theme, which is supposed to be a selling point, feels more like a pasted-on money grab than a tightly-integrated design choice. steampunk is supposed to be light and fun and fantastical, which is why it is popular. spyrium is not. the only steampunk elements are that it is set in victorian england and has a shiny green new power source. there are no airships, no mad scientists, no nothing but dry, boring pseudo-science and gloom.note: you can read the rules and play this game free online at board game arena. that way, you can see for yourself how you like it before buying it.",Negative, 0.2571428571428571,new like boring complicated time absolutely boring new well boring nicer murky like hard learn teach light fun like like complicated like like choice light fun popular shiny new power mad boring play free like,Negative

"the kaotiks playset could be great fun if it stayed on the track.as it is, it goes off frequently. the description states the manufacturers recommended age to be from 4 months to 15 years. i don't get it. small children should not be using, and certainly not infants. if it is a typo, hopefully they will correct it. i think the real age range for this should be 6-7 age, as it is initially fun. the problem is that after less than ten minutes it needs to recharge, which wouldn't be bad if you didn't have to constantly go after the car and put it back on the track. it is very hard to modulate the speed, very much like the old slot cars. the car goes forwards and backwards. you cannot turn it. there is no real feeling that you are controlling it, or that you can improve. for the price, you can buy a decent slot car track with two cars and slots and play with a friend. this is used by one person (unless you have someone else getting the car when it goes off the track....that was my job). i like the concept, but it just doesn't seem like it is worthwhile. my son and daughter both grew tired of it very quickly. in fairness, i have a very large slot car track that we love to play with, and we also have a bunch of r/c cars that we race in the yard (many of which were about the same price...and more fun). the one thing this car has going for it is acceleration. i think it would have been more fun to create a dragster type of track and have two of these race eachother.....or, give it some control, eliminate the track, and let it be driven around.",Negative, 0.14814814814814814,great fun recommended correct real fun problem bad hard like real improve decent play friend like like worthwhile tired fairness love play many fun fun create give,Positive

"that's what my son said when he realized that the burnout marks on the display box were in fact pre-printed on set's cardboard pieces. he will become jaded before long: the photoshopping on toy boxes is a growing concern. not sure either about the advertised ""scale"" 900 mph, but it's pretty darned fast, no doubt about it.the psychoplex is one of several playsets from kaotiks, all of which can be combined into one giant set. this one took 40 minutes to assemble. mostly straightforward, although plastic and cardboard are not ideal jigsaw mates. couple hints: only at step 4 does it mention to assemble on a smooth surface, but i recommend a very hard surface from the very start, the better to snap pieces together. another tip: the green fencing goes flat(ter) side in. unfortunately, pieces are not numbered in accordance with the instructions. the long green fencing, for example, is called out as part ""l"" in the instructions but the actual pieces are stamped ""s12."" also, pieces ""m"" and ""n"" are ""p2"" and ""p1,"" respectively. finally, the instructions do not mention the included stickers, the placement of only some of which are indicated on the box.the stated run time is 8 minutes, but thankfully our real-world experience is better. the car runs for 20 minutes, but takes almost as long to recharge. battery installation/replacement is not intuitive, both for the controller (which uses 4 aa batteries, not included) and the car (which uses a li-on battery, included). the battery compartment in the controller uses sliding plastic tabs to separate each pair of batteries. most devices require no such contraption, so i don't see the point. the car battery is tricky to install and remove, especially so for the stated age range (4+). the aa batteries will not last long*, since they do double duty in powering the controller and also charging the li-on. the controller uses infa-red optical transmitters, so it must be pointed at the car, which is slightly annoying because even small arm movements may affect the signal.* new aa batteries lasted only four cycles.the car is as spazzy as a mexican jumping bean. keep it away from carpet or it will pick up fuzz. you don't need the track, in fact. much of the time, the car jumps *out* of the track anyway. the car functions the same right side up or down, and seems sturdily designed. like the much worsedisney/pixar cars stunt racers double decker speedway, the vehicle retains playability on its own. the biggest downside in my opinion is the lack of a steering device on the remote. on the track, this is mitigated by the forced oval. on the floor, however, there is no control whatsoever, and you will be constantly placing the car back in the track. what would be cool is to race two cars at the same time. unfortunately, amazon does not list any accessories at this time.postscriptthe title of this review captures my son's initial disappointment at the enhanced graphics of the marketing material. he wanted to burn some rubber. ironically, he has. or at least some medium-density foam. there is black residue all over the track. cool for him, though i wonder what will happen when there is no tire rubber/foam left on the wheels.3 stars. the playability of this toy would be increased exponentially with a steering device. also, the aa batteries lead a cursed life because they not only control the car when the toy is in use, but they also charge the car's battery at all other times.update february 2014--------------------the rechargeable battery stopped charging.

"maybe i got a defective unit, but the car is impossible to control. it has a mind of its own and spins around randomly. it doesn't go straight and makes random turns and switches directions. pulling the trigger back or pushing it forward had no effect. it just does what it wants.the worst thing about the trigger is that it uses regular aa batteries to charge the special battery for the car, instead of using a wall charger. who thought of this? it's a waste of money. putting the track together was very time-consuming to get all the pieces lined up and snapped in. it definitely requires adult assistance.i helped put this together and played with it with a 10 year old boy and his adult cousin (22). both of them were confused by this product and the wtf behavior of the car. we also noticed skid marks on the arena flooring. after about 10 minutes of use, the bottom of the rear tires got all chewed up and fuzzy like the end of an eraser. the car frequently flies out of the arena.not fun. do not buy.",Negative, 0.6363636363636365,defective impossible randomly worst special waste helped confused fuzzy like fun,Negative
"this is fun at first, but it gets boring after a while.movement of the car is very fast and totally chaotic - you are not steering the car, but it will change direction after bumping into an obstacle (e.g. the outer fence of the course). it also will flip out of the course occasionally, which can get kind of frustrating if that happens a few times in a row. the stunts that the car performs are spectacular, but are really limited to flipping over in midair - once you have seen it a few times, it looses its novelty quickly.the whole toy is made of plastic and especially the fence has a flimsy feeling to it. this was obviously not designed with durability as one of the top goals.but what really infuriates me is the power supply - the car has a rechargeable battery, which you clip into the pistol-grip trigger device, which then loads the rechargeable battery of the car using its own aa batteries in the grip. since one charge only holds for a few minutes, you are draining the aa batteries in the grip at a very fast rate - replacing them will be expensive after a while. and if you use rechargeables for the grip, too, you have to have at least a couple of sets available,  because it takes some time to recharge the rechargeables ...all in all, this playset is fun for a short while and leads to frustration in the long run.",Negative, 0.39999999999999997,fun boring fast chaotic change direction bumping obstacle kind frustrating spectacular limited novelty whole flimsy top power draining fast expensive available time fun leads frustration,Negative

"my daughter loves sophia (thanks grandma), so i decided to give in and get her the castle. what a waste of space.i'd seen the other reviews and planned to give myself plenty of time to set it up before giving it to her. honestly, though, it didn't take as long as i thought it might given what i'd read. although the instructions are terrible and it still didn't feel very sturdy when complete, it didn't take much time. however, i'm not counting on it holding up to much of my three year old daughter's rough play (one of the gables already popped off once while she was playing on the inside of the house).i had the same problem others did with clover's ""hide-and-seek"" bed. the bed has a spot where he's clearly supposed to get snapped in, but he doesn't actually snap. he just sits on top and then falls off when you turn it over.the talking feature is also disappointing. even the concept - a single point in the castle where each figure can stand to have the castle rotate through a handful of phrases - is uninspired. but the execution makes it even worse. although it's worked for us a few times, it's incredibly inconsistent, and more often than not nothing happens when we try to make the figures talk.it also seems a little crazy that this giant castle only comes with one human figure (plus the rabbit). luckily, i was able to convince my daughter that sophia and her my little ponies could be best of friends.what surprised me most is that even my daughter who loves sophia just doesn't seem that interested in the castle. i think she spent fewer than five minutes with it before moving on to other toys. if you're considering sophia's castle, i'd just get a sturdier wooden dollhouse that's not based on a tv show if i could do it all over. you can always put a sophia figurine inside if it'll please your child.update (12/31/2013): just saw that this is not currently carried by amazon and that another vendor is selling it for 65 dollars! this was a dubious purchase at the 40 dollars amazon was charging.",Negative, 0.3125,loves give waste give time giving terrible still sturdy time rough play problem clearly top falls disappointing worse worked incredibly inconsistent crazy human able best surprised loves interested moving sturdier please dubious,Negative

"before i go any further, i would encourage those looking to purchase this to search amazon for ""disney sofia the first magical talking castle"" to see the reviews there. it looks like mattel has decided to rebrand this item by adding ""new"" to the title in an effort to dodge some criticism. from what i can having gotten this ""new"" version, nothing's changed. it's the same poorly-designed toy as from the past. in fact, i'm hard-pressed to determine what's ""new."" that said, on with the review.from the moment you open the box and a plethora of pieces fall out on the floor, you can tell you're in trouble. the included instructions (which share a great deal in common with ikea instructions, right down to the poor illustrations and lack of written interactions) are next to useless. once you get the castle assembled, you can see what the instructions were trying to tell you, but that's only with 20/20 hindsight. when you have the pieces strewn before you, it may be better to just look at the picture on the box and eyeball it.the previous complaints about sophia's head falling off still apply here. this would probably make a great horror set, when the damsel in distress literally loses her head, but as a fairy tale castle, it's definitely frustrating for both child and parent to have to put sophia's head back on every 5 minutes. sophia also doesn't like to stand up either, having a narrow, wobbly base that more or less demands that sophia spend her life in either a seated position or a face-plant.the ""'magic' base"" feature is terrible. while removing the base and carrying into a well-lit room results in limited functionality, you really should plan on completely skipping that ""feature."" it's just not designed well insofar as it needs lots of light to work but rests in a castle that shades it most of the time.the castle itself isn't half bad, though you should expect to immediately lose the small plate and goblet set much like you expect to lost anything the size of a hearing aid battery. at first i thought i'd say they might actually be a choking hazard, but after some thought i realized that even a 6 month-old would have no trouble swallowing these, so no worries there (sarcasm). but aside from that, it's kind of a fun play set for imagination... if you throw away sophia and the sound platform... and can get it assembled.all in all, i would really discourage anyone from buying this. if you're dead set on it, however, you really owe it to yourself to search for the ""not new"" version to see the reviews there. they capture the spirit of this ""new"" play set quite well.edit: in the comments section, ""cke"" reports that the new version of the castle has a plastic second floor rather than cardboard (ours was, indeed, plastic) and that sophia has been re-engineered so that her head does not fall off.  we did not get the new-and-improved sophia, but cke mentioned that the newer sets have the new sophia included, in addition to the old, so perhaps ours was just a bum package. while i believe my rating of 2 stars is still warranted, i think cke's information is important to include here.",Negative, 0.4137931034482757,encourage disney magical like new criticism new new open fall trouble great right poor lack useless better complaints falling still great distress loses frustrating like life magic terrible limited well light work bad lose like lost aid hazard trouble worries sarcasm kind fun play imagination discourage dead new spirit new play new fall new addition bum still important,Negative

"i bought 2 zoomers. this one in the black and white for my 4 year old son and the pink one, zoomie, for my 10 year old daughter. despite reading the bad reviews, i went ahead and bought these hoping they wouldn't have any of the charging issues i have been reading about. first of all, as soon as these came out of the box, i charged each one for an hour long as the directions described. we turned them on and they are the cutest most adorable little things you've ever seen. we were really impressed by the movements of the puppies and how much they resemble a real dog. now comes the problems. the pink dog zoomie follows commands fairly well. she also runs around and doesn't bump into furniture and things because i'm assuming these dogs come with a sensor of some type that prevents them from crashing into objects. however, this black and white one does not follow commands at all. we understand we have to be patient to train him, however, the zoomie pink dog responds much better and is way far less frustrating. this dog also runs into walls, and furniture and does not seem to be responding well at all. both puppies have one common issue as well. they do not understand my kids! the directions say to push down on the puppies head and wait for the question marks to show and then you can ask a command. i have tried to do this using my own adult voice, and can sometimes get the puppies to do the tricks, however, my kids are having a much more difficult time despite having them speak loud and clear as best as they can. as far as charging goes, i have not had any issues with zoomie, but once or twice i had issues with zoomer where i had to turn him off, unplug the charger and try again. i usually can get him to charge with no problems, but we'll see how long that lasts. remember, it takes about an hour charging time and the child only gets about 20 minutes of playtime which i think is ridiculous. if your zoomer is all the way dead, you should proceed to charge, but remember his eyes may not light up at first if he doesn't have enough power to light up. if you wait a few minutes and test his eyes again, he should light up if working properly. i have never used my computer to charge either puppy. i have been using a wall outlet and so far after a few days, both my zoomers are charging. the idea in general is very cute and if these guys would work as advertised, i'm sure they would be a big hit. however, there are several issues that need to be worked out. in my opinion, if you want to buy one of these, and you don't mind the pink zoomie, go with that one as i've had a lot less issues with that puppy compared to the black and white zoomer.",Negative, 0.3478260869565217,bad issues adorable impressed puppies real problems fairly well bump crashing understand patient better frustrating well puppies issue well understand puppies puppies difficult time loud clear best issues issues problems well time ridiculous dead light enough power light light properly idea cute work issues worked issues,Negative

"we fell for the hype before christmas too.  my 5 year old son wanted it so badly, finally got it, and by the end of the day on christmas we all knew, including my son, this was just a waste of a toy.here is the sole positive thing about this toy:when he's on, he is cute.  his puppy motions are very accurate, and match a &#34;real&#34; puppy in a cool way.  the kids liked watching him stick his butt up in the air, run around, and roll.that being said, after watching him move in a cute way for awhile, they wanted this dog to do what it is supposed to do:  obey commands.  and here starts the cons list:1.  charge lasts for only about 20 minutes!  you can play with the stupid thing for only 20 minutes (fully charged for an hour!) and then you have to plug it back in.  why bother?  we thought it was a toy we could kind of leave out and play with throughout the day.  no.  you play with it for a short time, then plug it back in for at least an hour.  then play again for a short time.  then plug it back in.  this is beyond frustrating.  he ends up just being always dead.2.  what is this &#34;he learns more commands the more you play with him&#34; nonsense?  he is a robot!  what does &#34;learn&#34; mean?  humans know how humans learn, but how are we to know how robots &#34;learn&#34;?  they should reveal this &#34;secret&#34; to the parents so we can at least know how to know if the kids are on the right track to getting the dog to understand them.  does zoomer need to hear a voice say &#34;play dead&#34; 10 times, 50 times, or 100 times before he'll actually do it?  is this magic &#34;learned&#34; number hard-coded somewhere in his computer, that he needs to hear something x amount of times before he can do it?  care to share that secret with the folds forking out $80+ to purchase him?  we should know how to verify whether or not he is working correctly.  and does he need to learn in one session before the battery dies, or can his learning be spread out amongst his very frequent recharges?  and how long does he retain the learned material?  a few days?  a week? a month?  and what does &#34;he's a puppy, sometimes he may not feel like following your instructions&#34; (found in the manual) mean???  is it coded in him somewhere to only follow every other command?  every 3 commands?  it would seem like any malfunction could be excused as &#34;well he's just a puppy, he's in a 'bad mood' (also in the manual) or he hasn't learned that command yet?&#34;  well i'm not buying it.  computers should be reliable, and this is a computer.  so how does it work??  we have no way to tell.  in any event, it doesn't matter, because it would seem he never learns or obeys....see #3.3.  he doesn't do anything my kids tell him.  now, siri on my iphone often doesn't understand my kids either.  kids don't always have the best pronunciation, so this is understandable.  but zoomer doesn't understand anything they say ever...and they have normal kid pronunciation.  why market a toy to children that requires perfect pronunciation to function?  no matter however, because he doesn't understand me either, even when i speak very carefully.  when he doesn't understand me, sometimes i think, &#34;we'll maybe he just hasn't 'learned' this command yet, or is in a 'bad mood' (whatever that means!), but even after saying it over and over, he still doesn't do it.  i've never gotten this dog to do a command.  at least i can't tell if he has done one, because he spends all his time rolling around and being super hyper, so i'll say something, and then try to observe whether he has performed the action in the midst of all the other rolling and spinning he is doing.  so basically he's too hyper to even know if he's doing what you ask.4.  my kids have given up and so have i.  we don't know what this &#34;learning&#34; process involves, and he doesn't even stay charged long enough to explore it in any significant way.  this toy is garbage.  and i'm mad about it because he was so expensive.  i hate this toy.",Negative, 0.2833333333333333,fell hype badly waste positive cute accurate cool liked air cute cons play stupid bother kind play play time play time beyond frustrating play nonsense learn right understand hell magic care verify correctly learn dies learning like like bad well reliable work understand best understandable understand perfect understand understand bad still time super action enough significant garbage mad expensive hate,Negative

"i always felt the best figure interpretation of the black adam has been the from the democrat hands of alex ross in the justice line. upon getting this new 52 black adam figure, my opinion (like elbows and kneecaps) remains the same.needless to say, i still purchased the figure at my local comic shop. it was not until i got home that i realized how little i liked the figure.  hindsight it 20/20, but i wish that i had not been in such a rush while at the store so i would have had more time to carefully evaluate the figure to determine whether or not is was worth the purchase or not.my grandmother drove me to the comic shop and was honking her horn relentlessly to hurry up. to make matters worse, i had drunk far too much rootbeer. the store owner doesn't let anyone use the store restroom for one reason or another so i had to wait till i got to the fabric store with my grandmother before i could go. she was in a rush to pick up more fabric for the george zimmerman christmas musical her church group is performing this year at the parade children's academy.as for the sense of design of the character's costume it is difficult to relate to either. on one end with the justice version, there is a grown man in tights with broad open collar and free-flowing sash that appears as if he just left jazz dance class. with the 52 version, there is a greater sense of flair in the liberace wardrobe dropout complete with dramatic high collar, cape and even louder boots. failure to mention the attention driven compensating size of the belt would be criminal.being the arch-nemesis black adam is to shazam, one can't help but wonder why the obsession. perhaps the inner child of shazam is what appeals to black adam. seems to me, he may need to register as a sex offender now or take his alluring sense of style to the stage.",Negative, 0.34615384615384615,best justice new like still liked time worth relentlessly worse drunk reason difficult justice open flair dropout louder failure help wonder obsession inner offender alluring style,Negative

"oh where to start with this one.  logo party is not much of a party, it isn't much fun at all.  it is disappointing because there seems like an awfully good idea tucked in here, but generally it just fails at every turn.most problematic is the actual design of the physical game.  the game comes with a holder for the cards, unfortunately it is slightly too small for the number of cards they give you, so you are left either jamming in cards and bending them or having to leave a certain number out, cluttering your table etc.  not a huge deal but not a good first impression.the huge problem we ran into was with the timer/card revealer.  it is made of the cheapest plastic they could find and thus right out of the box it didn't work.  you are supposed to be able to pull up the timer and have it lock, allowing you to place the card in it.  it didn't lock.  there is also supposed to be a ding when the timer runs out.  there was not a ding.  this was less of a problem as the excruciatingly loud grinding noise the timer makes when going down is noticeable enough when it stops.  sadly it is also massively distracting and annoying during game play.despite the cheapness and poor design of the game, all would be forgiven if it were actually fun.it is not fun.essentially you put into one of three categories, draw it, do it or describe it.  describe it is painfully easy.  during the course of the entire game, no one missed it once.  draw it was a bit harder, but not by much.  the only one that was missed was trying to draw &#34;air china&#34; in the 20 second limit.  do it is charades and when you are doing it to something like &#34;progresso&#34; it seems really stupid.essentially no one missed a question with rare exceptions.  since you can play until you miss one, the entire game rest on &#34;reveal it&#34; spaces in which someone puts a card in the timer/revealer and slowly shows you the logo, the first person to gets it gets control of the board and moves forward.  and that is it.  no brand trivia, nothing to really shake things up.after an hour, we all just wondered why we weren't playing cranium, a better game with more variety.i was excited about this game, but it was just a miss.  it's too bad, i think there might be something here.",Negative, 0.553191489361702,start fun disappointing like awfully good idea fails problematic unfortunately give huge good huge problem cheapest right work able allowing ding ding problem excruciatingly loud noise enough sadly distracting annoying poor painfully easy missed missed limit like missed play miss rest slowly shake better excited miss bad,Negative

"applejack is cute, but for some reason she looks the least like her pony character out of any of the dolls of the set. it is some the eye shape and possibly the fact her freckles are darker and almost blend in with her face. she looks better in the pictures than in person.these dolls look nothing like the characters from the ""equestria girls"" movie. they look more like a product of weird mlp furry fanfic. some kids won't care about this, but many will notice it as soon as they see them and find that disappointing. their quality is a mixed bag. the faces are painted beautifully with glossy paint and glitter. i'm not a big fan of heavy makeup on dolls, but hasbro made their faces a mixture of whimsical, but tasteful and cute. the styles of clothing are adorable, too. the dresses/skirts tend to be a bit short, but they are girly enough (they are not made to look ""sexy"") it is cute.however, the quality really stops there. the clothing is a nightmare! it is cheap and poorly-made. a lot of the dolls' clothes aren't hemmed on the bottom and either look ragged--or will look ragged in a few play sessions. the seams on some of the clothes are starting to fall apart in the box. it's a shame hasbro had to be so cheap as they already got around the clothing costs by making a lot of the dolls' tops painted on the body.this wouldn't be a biggie as fashion doll clothes can be exchanged with other brands or hand-made by a talented child/parent/collector. however, any creativity on making future clothes is limited by the shoes. they are part of the feet. as a parent and toy collector, this trend really bothers me to begin with. it is really gross and creepy taking off the shoes on the footless dolls. the knobs that hold the shoes on the legs look like bones. it also sends the really negative message to girls that shoes are more important than feet. yuck!as a parent, i find this very impractical and wasteful as shoe/feet can be easily lost and you end up with a doll who forever looks like she had an accident with a machete--a lovely marketing technique to force you to buy future (cheaply-made) outfits to obtain more ""feet."" if you are a parent worried about this or have a sensitive child, it may be a good time to break out the super-glue. come on, hasbro--these girls were ponies. they need their feet. at least make them into hooves.next, the bodies on the equestria girls in the smaller packages are very cheap. the legs are stiff plastic. only the ones in the deluxe fashion sets bends at the knee (the more expensively-priced rainbow dash and fluttershy). i never understood how toy companies could make dolls like this as it seems to be a safety hazard, but it's also low-quality and not as fun to play with. a few barbies have legs like that, but they are either dolls either for tub play (so they don't mildew) or ones that are marked well into the $5-7 range--which tells me hasbro is trying to cut corners every way possible to make a buck and the equestria girls are ridiculously over-priced.finally we get to the hair. the plugs in the front are tight and close together, but the plugs past that are *very* sparse. the scalp appears to painted to hide this on applejack, but not for the other dolls. the hair is typical pony hair--and it's probably a good thing it's sparse for that reason as it will knot quickly. the hair quality is okay for the small ponies (because of the way it's lined up), but will be a total pain to brush out on a fashion doll. not at all the quality you'd see in a barbie or monster high doll.all-in-all, i don't think i'd purchase this doll if i saw it in the store--not for these prices (even the retail ones)--or i'd only buy my kid's favorite character (rainbow dash). i discourage fellow parents and toy collectors from spending any less than retail on it (if even that). this toy is maybe worth $10--at the most. barbie dolls that are similar (hard legs, painted on tops--but almost always better hair) cost even less than that. there are many other dolls that are higher-quality in the same price range or less.",Negative, 0.3599999999999998,cute reason like darker better like like weird care many disappointing quality beautifully glitter cute adorable enough sexy quality nightmare cheap ragged play fall shame cheap tops talented creativity future limited bothers gross creepy like negative important impractical wasteful easily lost like lovely future worried sensitive good time break cheap stiff rainbow understood like safety hazard fun play like play well ridiculously good reason quality pain quality monster favorite rainbow discourage worth hard better many,Negative

"i have never been wild about board games or party games designed on an electronic game, and although this one is cute, i have to say it falls well short of the online ""draw something"". for one thing, it needs a stand - some sort of base to stand the thing upright. it is awkward to draw on it so someone can see the reverse side. but i am getting ahead of myself. designed to look like a large flat pencil with a window in its middle, the game lights up when turned on and has a timer alarm that is charming. it comes with a deck of cards as well, although they do not fit easily into the holder on the game device nor withdraw easily from that holder. you draw on the window with a stylus a picture of one of the objects named on a card you drew and others guess what you are drawing from the artwork and the random letters displayed on the back of the card. it is sort of like, dare i say, ""pictionary""? except you do it on this neat green screen with a stylus. you achieve points dependent on the difficulty of the word selected and whether or not it is guessed successfully. the texture of the drawing surface is nice to draw on and that would be enough without adding the game dimension, because the game aspect doesn't seem well thought out.the words on the cards are just a little obscure, and, although the game is touted to be for ages 8 and above, some of the words will be way past an eight-year-old. for instance, how many kids of that age know what a rolls royce looks like? or who in the heck is psy, radiohead, judge judy, jay leno, or little wayne? how many eight-year-olds watch downton abbey? as a family, it is no fun to play something that mom and dad have to explain to the kids, and for the kids, trying to draw something when you have no idea what it is can only be a source of frustration.  we tested the game on lunch hour at the office and found even adults had a hard time figuring out what to draw for many of the clues.the game is cute, the drawing surface really cool, but a bit of a disappointment otherwise. to me, the true worth of the online game is that you try to draw something your opponent can guess and win points if you are successful in drawing something your opponent recognizes and your opponent gets points for guessing correctly. its charm to me is that it is a win-win scenario with cooperation between artist and guesser. this game doesn't achieve that interesting format",Negative, 0.29166666666666663,wild cute falls well awkward like alarm charming well fit easily easily like neat achieve difficulty successfully nice enough well obscure touted many like heck many family fun play idea frustration hard time many cute cool disappointment worth opponent win successful opponent opponent correctly charm cooperation achieve interesting,Negative

"update (april 8, 2014): i was able to ""fix"" the broken leg by splitting open the upper leg area at the seam where it's glued. this seam wasn't very strong and may have already been split, leading to the leg falling off. from there, all i needed to do was line it up and apply a lot of pressure, and the socket in the leg slipped onto the ball on the hip. i then used model cement (tenax, a very thin, extremely toxic glue, rather than the thick, gooey testor's stuff) and clamped the leg halves firmly together for the better part of a day. by clamp i mean really clamped - using a bar-type clamp that has enough strength to squeeze the plastic halves together and cause some of the softened plastic out of the seam. since then, the doll's leg has been fine. shouldn't have to to this.original review (nov. 12, 2013): my younger daughter, 5, loved this the moment i gave it to her. within a week, the right leg had broken off, apparently bent too far which resulted in the leg separating from a ball joint at the hip. it appears to be irreparable, unfortunately. my wife points out that barbie dolls have easily replaced legs because mattel knows this is likely to happen. i've been messing with this doll for weeks now trying to get the leg back on, and the only way i can see is to split it at the seam, pop it back on, and attempt to glue it. i haven't bothered yet because i doubt even the nasty, caustic model cement i have will heal the split seam. my daughter love it, so i give the ""fun"" aspect 4 stars, but the problems force me to rate it 1 star: avoid, not worth the money or heartache when your child can't play with it anymore.another odd thing with this doll is that the boots are the ends of the legs. they are removable and swappable with other dolls, but it can't be played with minus boots like most other dolls, with just knobs at the ends of the legs. not much fun unless there's an amputee theme going during playtime. perhaps the manufacturer wants to enlighten the youth of today about sensitive issues such as this. a teachable moment, as they say.",Negative, 0.45238095238095255,able broken splitting open strong split leading falling toxic better enough strength fine loved right broken bent irreparable unfortunately easily messing split bothered doubt nasty caustic heal split love give fun problems worth play odd like fun enlighten youth sensitive issues teachable,Negative

"twilight sparkle so far is my least favorite of the bunch. like her pony counterpart--hasbro has a very hard time matching the color of her head with her body. on a fashion doll, this is especially strange-looking and noticable---it's like she has a weird tan line. like the rest of the dolls from the non-deluxe sets, her hair is super sparse. you can see her scalp easily through her bangs. she is not worth retail price (for reasons listed below). maybe ten clams.it's worth noting these dolls look *nothing* like the characters from the ""equestria girls"" movie. they look more like a product of weird mlp furry fanfic instead. some kids won't care about this, but many will notice it as soon as they see them and find that disappointing. their quality is a mixed bag. the faces are painted beautifully with glossy paint and glitter. i'm not a big fan of heavy makeup on dolls, but hasbro made their faces are a mixture of fancy but tasteful and cute. the styles of clothing are cute, too. the dresses/skirts tend to be a bit short, but they are girly enough that it is cute.however, the quality really stops there. the actual quality of the clothing is a nightmare! it is cheap and poorly-made. a lot of the dolls' clothes aren't hemmed on the bottom. the seams on some of the clothes are starting to fall apart in the box. it's a shame hasbro had to be so cheap as they already got around the clothing costs by making a lot of the dolls' tops painted on the body.this wouldn't be a biggie as fashion doll clothes can be exchanged with other brands or hand-made by a talented child/parent/collector. however, any creativity on making future clothes is limited by the shoes. they are part of the feet. as a parent and toy collector, this trend really bothers me to begin with. it is really gross and creepy taking off the shoes on the footless dolls. it also sends the really negative messege to girls that shoes are more important than feet. yuck! as a parent, i find this very impractical and wasteful as shoe/feet can be easily lost and you end up with a doll who forever looks like an amputee--a lovely marketing technique to force you to buy future (cheaply-made) outfits to obtain more ""feet."" if you are a parent worried about this, it may be a good time to break out the super-glue. come on, hasbro--these girls were ponies. they need their feet. at least make them into hooves.the bodies on the equestria girls in the smaller packages are very cheap. the legs are stiff plastic. only the ones in the deluxe fashion sets bends at the knee (the more expensively-priced rainbow dash and fluttershy). i never understood how toy companies could make dolls like this as it seems to be a safety hazard, but it's also low-quality. they are also not as fun to play with. a few barbies have legs like that, but they are either dolls either for tub play (so they don't mildew) or ones that are marked well into the $5-7 range--which tells me hasbro is trying to cut corners every way possible to make a buck and the equestria girls are ridiculously over-priced.finally, we get to the hair. the plugs in the front of most of the dolls (except twilight sparkle) are tight and close together, but the plugs past that are *very* sparse. the hair is typical pony hair--and it's probably a good thing it's sparse for that reason as it will knot quickly. okay for ponies (because of the way it's lined up), but a pain to brush out on a fashion doll. not at all the quality you'd see in a barbie.all-in-all, i don't think i'd purchase this doll if i saw it in the store--just rainbow dash and maybe fluttershy as the deluxe style sets are a little better made. i discourage fellow parents and toy collectors from spending any less than retail on it (if even that). this toy is maybe worth ten clams--at the most. barbie dolls that are similar (hard legs, painted on tops--but almost always better hair) cost even less than that, and the monster dolls (monster high, bratzillas) are better quality and can be grabbed for that much when they are on sale.",Negative, 0.33734939759036137,sparkle favorite like hard time like weird like rest super easily worth worth like like weird care many disappointing quality beautifully glitter fancy cute cute enough quality quality nightmare cheap fall shame cheap tops talented creativity future limited bothers gross creepy negative important impractical wasteful easily lost like lovely future worried good time break cheap stiff rainbow understood like safety hazard fun play like play well ridiculously sparkle good reason pain quality rainbow style better discourage worth hard better monster monster better quality,Negative

"i get it, licensing sells.  still, with the bright colors and unconventional shape of knex pieces, this doesn't look like a  super mario ghosr house, or a typical haunted house, or any kind of building.  it looks like a crazy jungle gym.  the whole point of knex is to be creative and to use the pieces, and your imagination, to create something new.  mixing in licensed items into an arty-creative toy is already tricky, and this one isn't faithful to the base material so... what's the point?  you're doing a disservice to the license and the product.it does function as a decent playhouse or playset for 3""-ish figures, and is designed similar to the layout of a super mario 3d land level.  there are platforms that move (manually, not on their own or with any gears), there are coins to collect (ugly coins that often fall off on their own), the moving 'staircase' type platforms work fairly well for a playset, most of the assemblies are fairly tough and don't come apart unintentionally, but there are also several areas comprised of mini-knex, including a carwash type hanging curtain that a ghost toy pushes into.  the mini-knex come apart very easily, so i don't understand why they are used in an area that is pushed against.  as such, the curtain is constantly popping off.  some ghosts spin on a system of gears as you move through the playset.  the gears are stiff and unreliable.  there is a large heavy ghost that spins down a curving rod.  works great, until you go to reset it and pull the whole assembly off as there isn't anything actually attaching it to the playset (it just rests in a hole).  then there is a catapult system to launch mario onto a flagpole base, to finish the 'level'.  the flagpole assembly is pretty cool, and the flag actually rises when you nail it.  that said, its very hard to make the shot.  the catapult only launches mario 6"" or so, so the catapult must be placed right next to the flagpole case, and even then mario usually splits in half and both ends of the toy fly off in different directions.i'm recommend just buying a generic set of knex and letting your child use their own creativity to build a variety of items, instead of shoehorning this oddball license into an ugly, dysfunctional playset.pros- very nice build quality.  nothing feels like it would break, even after long-term use.- mario specific toy and ghosts are very nice quality.  could be nice collector figurines if they plug the knex specific holes.- large variety of pieces- cool theme?cons- doesn't look like a mario level or a cohesive knex environment.- many features just don't work very well- corners cut in construction makes for a semi-rickity playset.",Negative, 0.18518518518518517,still bright like super kind like crazy whole creative imagination create new tricky faithful disservice decent super ugly fall moving work fairly well fairly tough easily understand stiff unreliable works great whole pretty cool hard right recommend creativity variety ugly nice quality like break nice quality nice variety cool like cohesive many work well,Positive

"i have really mixed opinions about this toy. we are a big nintendo/super mario fan family and have played the games for years. so i thought this might be fun to try out and my 9 year old daughter was overjoyed to order it.the kit is large with 450 pieces, many of which are specialized like a cloud top or spring open coin box. that makes each piece about 14 cents each, a little expensive for k'nex pieces but once you add the character licensing in...the kit took her quite awhile to put together, it wasn't super easy so the build was a fun challenge. she was frustrated that k'nex doesn't take a page from lego instructions and show which pieces you need for each step but overall, the instructions work fine.once it was assembled, it takes up a lot of room. we put ours on a large, square coffee table. then it was time to play.so this is where i get hung up on it. i'm just not sure why anyone would take a video game and try to make it work with physical pieces. and this is also where the product falls really short. while it is fun to launch mario from the jumpers, it is very hard to get him to land where you want. and when he does, you have to 'play act' him across each part. there is a centrally located device that you can attach him to and pretend to jump him from one part to another but it is awkward to play with. i watched my daughter work way to hard to get it to work with very little enjoyment. pieces kept falling off, parts of it didn't make sense and while you shouldn't need an instruction book to figure out how to play with it, some of it wasn't intuitive, like trying to hit 'coins'.so i am torn. while this is fun to think about, it is not so much fun in the execution and for a k'nex building set (or in comparison to some others) it is pretty expensive.",Negative, 0.28205128205128205,family fun overjoyed order many like cloud top open expensive add super easy fun challenge frustrated work time hung work falls fun hard play pretend awkward play work hard work enjoyment falling play intuitive like fun fun pretty expensive,Negative

"our experience so far:5/1/14: written to their customer support:my mother spend an insane amount of money buying my children the leappad ultra in order to help my 4 year old catch up to a pre k level (he has terrible eyesight that was recently diagnosed and glasses purchased, but not being able to see has put him behind) and to help my 6 year old with his first grade skills.while setting it up for me, she was going to purchase 5 apps to get them started. the first problem was that your system rejected her credit card the entire ""buy within 2 hours to receive 30% off"" period.i called. they said she had a different name from mine and she needed to call to add her information to the billing information. she called and did this, i was to receive an email within an hour confirming this had been done. 3 hours later, i had no email but attempted to purchase the apps through the leappad as instructed.there was no billing information on the account. it rejected my credit card. i called again. they claimed all the errors were due to the cvv number being wrong. neither of us have ever had a problem with this on any other online purchases, anywhere. they told me to try again, as i finally received that first email confirming the billing changes were made.again, the leapfrog account showed no billing information in it's records. i tried putting my mother's credit card and mine into the account information and directly into the checkout page. again nothing but errors.called again and was rudely told it was on our end and asked had we checked the bank. again we told them we had never had trouble with our cvv numbers.the rep offered to send a report ""to determine if the error was on our end or theirs"". he told me it would be monday before we heard back from them. keep in mind the 30% offer is only good the first day of registration. keep in mind i have a 4 year old and a 6 year old that will be super excited to have their own tablet but nothing (other than 3 simple apps) to do with it until monday. i have to deal with their disappointment.the rep was kind enough to supposedly add a note so that we will eventually get our 30% off, only after i insisted.my mother called back. there were no supervisors available (naturally). the most she could get out of their indifference was to put a rush on the request. supposedly we will hear from them this evening instead of monday. considering how long the 1 hour email took, i am not holding my breath.we have already decided that if this situation is not corrected quickly, we will return your product and proceed to spread the word to all of our friend and social networks. it seems ridiculous that your company would disappoint children and cause this much trouble just to receive money.5/2/14 : so far they tell me they are 'looking into why my mother's card won't work' and gave me a 20% off coupon for future purchases... not sure how to use it since i can freaking make a first purchase... also no mention on why my card won't work on their system. no mention on customer service's indifference to our problem.5/3/14 : no word. the 30% off offer is no longer showing on our cart. my cc is still not being accepted. my children still don't have the apps they were promised to play and learn with. i am so upset with leap frog.5/6/14: another email from them. they claim that my mother's information has been updated in the billing system. the stupid thing still won't accept either of our cards to pay with and the 30% off deal is expired. i am thinking that both of the introductory deals are scams at this point. buy apps within the first 2 hour (or day) and get 30% off!!!! ha ha, you can't make a purchase.",Negative, 0.434782608695652,experience insane order help terrible able help problem rejected add rejected errors wrong problem trouble error good super excited simple kind enough add available indifference friend ridiculous disappoint trouble work future freaking work indifference still accepted still promised play learn upset stupid still accept expired scams,Negative

"to start with, let me say we are a family that owns three tag readers, two tag juniors, one each of leapster, leapster 2 and leapster explorer, and at one point we also bought a leappad but hated it so much that we returned it after one day.i received this new leapreader, which is an update to the tag reader, for review. in the package i also received two leapreader books,leapfrog leapreader book: leap and the lost dinosaur (works with tag)andleapfrog leapreader book: learn to write numbers with mr. pencil.a quick overview: the leapreader adds new functionalities to the tag reader, including stand-alone audiobooks and music player. it also comes with a built-in rechargeable battery as opposed to alkalines in the tag reader.  in case you have never seen a tag reader before, the leapreader uses an optical recognition system that picks up information on specially printed paper (basically paper with tiny little dotted patterns that tell the leapreader which book, which page and which ""hot spot"" the tip is scanning, and the on-board little computer can then play the respective content.)the out-of-package experience has been overwhelmingly negative. the reviewer's sheet claims that the two included books in the review kit had been pre-installed. not true. to my unpleasant surprise, only the dinosaur book was playable out of the box. the mr. pencil book was not installed, and, worse, the sample book that's included in every retail package was also not installed!anyone who's ever used a leapfrog ""smart"" educational toy before knows how bad their leapfrog connect program is. this is the program that you must install on a pc in order to download audio content to the leapreader (much as with the older tag and tag junior). when i read on the packaging that i must use the leapfrog connect program again, my heart skipped a beat and my blood pressure went up.  i really hated that program.  (don't ask me why we kept buying leapfrog products...)i'm happy to report that the updated leapfrog connect program is as buggy as ever.  first of all, like any half-smart computer user, i use a standard user account 100% of the time (so to shield my system from potential viral attacks).  if you have an older version of leapfrog connect installed on your computer,  you must log into the administrator account in order to update it!  seriously, leapfrog.  any decent windows program would update under the user account control, without the user's having to log into the admin account separately.  so now i had to log into my admin account, which i had never had to do once since getting this lenovo laptop over a year ago.  that was annoying.  responding to the uac with your admin password is a 5-second process; logging into the admin account takes more time because now all your account settings and start-up apps must load.  just plain annoying.okay, so i did that.  the connect program updated itself without much of a problem, although the updater interface is ridiculously crude: it just says ""wait until download is complete, then click ok"". no progress bar, no estimated time remaining.  it's 2013 and leapfrog's software guys write crap like this???then i connected the new leapreader to the updated leapfrog connect program via usb -- funny that my reviewer's sheet warns against the reviewr connecting the leapreader to the computer at all, or the ""included"" contents would be erased.  whoever works in leapfrog marketing should...  ok, whatever.indeed, connecting my shiny new leapreader to leapfrog connect deleted the dinosaur book's audio content. once i logged into my leapfrog account, i was given a couple of free audio samples, including, finally, the sample file for the included sample book.  scratching my head in disbelief... who the heck came up with this great product??according to leapfrog connect, the leapreader has a meager 201 mb of memory.  the sample book's audio file is 9mb. the dinosaur book's audio file (which i later downloaded) is 8mb.  the mr. pencil book is 11mb.  let's say the average book's audio file is 10mb in size. that comes to up to 20 books you can store on the leapreader.  its 2013 and leapfrog's hardware guys make crap like this???  that's at most 20 books without any other content!actually i got ahead of myself a little.  when i was trying to download the dinosaur and mr. pencil books' contents, i ran into problems with the lovely leapfrog connect program.  just as it happened before, this updated version (albeit looking better than before) kept trying to download or sync, or both, the audio file(s) to the leapreader.  i was disconcerted by the countless disconnect/connect happenings that were taking place between the leapreader and the leapfrog connect program.  i thought the infamous bug, whereby leapfrog connect was never able to download any content to your expensive toy, was going to bite again.  out of experience, i decided to leave the syncing alone and went to get lunch for my kids.  when i came back, the books synced.  later, i synced the u.s. map audio file and that appears to have synced fine.  (i haven't been able to check the map audio since my kids appear to have misplaced the tag map!)now, if you have a tag, you may be wondering whether the leapreader is compatible with tag books.  judging from the ""companion audio"" download screen, it seems that only some tag books are compatible with the leapreader. for example, ourleapfrog tag activity storybook kung fu panda: po's tasty trainingis not on the list, therefore we'll not be able to re-enjoy that small book with the leapreader.  only a few tag books like i spy imagine that! and spy wars the clone wars are on the downloadable companion audio list.  this sucks, period.  we have a dozen tag books that we bought.  i thought at least my baby is now old enough to read them, but with the three tag readers misplaced (with one probably conveniently ""borrowed"" without permission by one of the neighborhood boys who's known to take to, at the ripe age of 8, borrowing other people's toys without asking and displaying them in his bedroom), we now cannot rely on leapreader to read these books. just sucks, like i said.in summary, i'm once again disappointed by a leapfrog product.  all they have to do is invest a few dollars and get a working syncing program before releasing these hardware products.  better yet, they should make these things wireless capable, so that all us parents have to do is download content on the fly, without having to find the pc to connect to.  seriously, there're so many ways to improve this product.  sadly, the same was said by me and others 3 or 4 years ago when we first bought into leapfrog's ""non-smart"" educational toys.",Negative, 0.2989690721649485,start family hated new lost works learn new recognition hot play experience overwhelmingly negative unpleasant worse smart bad connect order content connect heart hated happy connect buggy like time attacks connect order decent annoying time connect problem ridiculously crude ok progress time crap like connected new connect funny works ok shiny new connect content free disbelief heck great connect meager crap like problems lovely connect better disconcerted connect infamous bug connect able content expensive experience fine able compatible compatible well able like sucks enough conveniently ripe sucks like disappointed releasing better capable content connect many improve sadly,Negative

"these leappad products are definitely kid proof. this model has replaceable and rechargeable batteries which is nice. the ultra version batteries are not user replaceable which is a big downside of that model. battery life is good, i'd guess about 10 hours or so. our son uses them on long car trips without them losing power.we have two leap pads. one is this leappad2 model and the other is the ultra (free to us as vine members). as far as the product itself they are fine and the biggest advantage of them is they are very sturdy and kid proof. our 4-year-old son has put them both through the test, hitting the screen very hard with the stylus, getting the screen wet and putting his food covered fingers on the screen. they clean up and perform perfectly.the apps are mostly pretty good, one big advantage is they are voice directed so if the little on can't read they still can use the apps. i must say our 4-year-old learned the alphabet by himself with the leappad in about a week.the really big downside, and the one that makes me mark it two stars, is the apps are way too expensive. some can be had for about $5 but they are far from the best apps. many of them are $25. yes you can often find sales but that takes 10-20% off the price reducing the $25 apps down to perhaps $20 - still very expensive.in an era when you can buy a 7&#34; tablet (not kid proof) for under $100 and load it up with good apps which are anywhere from free to $5 i just can't see spending the outrageous prices for the leap apps. i'm guessing it is a matter of volume. if leapfrog sold in huge volume like tablet apps do then the prices might come down.purchase a dozen apps for the leappad and you've likely spent upwards of $200.we have purchased a few apps for the leappad but tend to buy way less expensive apps for our smartphones and let our son play with them. the leappad is used less and less now. we will likely buy our son a 7&#34; tablet next.",Negative, 0.22580645161290322,replaceable nice replaceable downside life good losing free fine advantage sturdy hard food clean pretty good advantage still downside expensive best many yes still good free outrageous huge like expensive play,Negative
"my five-year-old daughter has been wanting a leap pad for about six months now since she played her cousin's, so i was happy to get the opportunity to try this one.  boy am i glad we didn't spend money on it.the good points of this device begin and end with the ease of set up.  out of the box, the leap pad will be ready to use in about ten minutes of hooking up to the internet and downloading from the leap frog website.when my daughter first got the leap pad, she dove right into it and played most of the rest of the day, pausing only when we insisted that she give her older sister a turn to satisfy her curiosity.  i was relieved that finally she won't be pestering me for my smartphone all the time.after playing with it again the next day for less than an hour, however, my daughter asked me for my phone again.  by the end of the week she had practically forgotten about the leap pad and was right back with the phone.  while giving in and letting her borrow my phone, i decided to see what this leap pad is all about.  didn't take me more than 5 minutes to want my phone back.the package includes nine apps when you initially connect to the leap frog website.  among these are a decent art program, a pet corner and a game that ""teaches"" the flags and various random useless facts about countries the majority of adults have never heard of.  there is also a calculator, a clock and a couple other apps your average preschooler will never touch.  to the extent she has used it at all since the initial days, my daughter only uses the pet and art apps.the package also includes a $20 download card in order to load more programs from the leap frog website.  at first i was pretty impressed.  the apps range from $5 and up and you get a discount the more apps you buy.  the apps include games, videos, ebooks and other sorts of ""educational"" material.  i was able to get five apps, so i was pretty happy.  at first the new apps didn't download to the device properly and my daughter couldn't find them, but my husband hooked the device back up to the internet and the problem resolved itself.the problem is, the apps are junk.  the games are very simplistic and repetitive.  among the games we got, there were two themes.  three of the games involved inserting missing pieces to create a complete tube or waterslide to get from one end of a path to the other.  two of the games involved patterns of moving objects out of the way to ""free"" something (a polar bear, for instance).  the one ebook we got was insulting, even for a preschooler's cognitive level and my daughter didn't want to touch it again.i'm sure our mistake was choosing the cheaper alternatives.  i'm guessing that the apps that cost $20 and up may hold your child's attention better.  but who wants to spend that kind of money on a child's toy that already costs nearly $100?  it's just a continual black hole sucking money straight out of your wallet.  you can also choose cartridges which can at least be shared among friends, but they are also expensive and are probably easily lost.once you set up the device and register your child(ren), leap frog will send you periodic updates regarding your child's ""progress"".  this is to give further credibility to leap pad as an ""educational learning tool"".  the fact is, however, there is little that is educational about this or any other electronic gadget.  memorizing facts is not ""learning"".  age appropriate learning for a preschooler involves hands-on exploration and discovery, pretend play, engagement with parents and other adults, as well as interaction with peers.  none of that is offered - and, in fact, is stilted - by isolated, controlled ""play"" on a gadget.in any case, in this modern world, electronic gadgets may be nearly unavoidable.  if you really think your youngster needs a gadget, a simple small tablet would probably be a better option.  there are plenty of free games and other apps for tablets.  it may not look as inviting and ""child-friendly"" as this device with its two extra styluses and doc mcstuffins wallpaper, but it's a much better deal in the long run.update 3/13/14:  two other things i forgot to mention.  first, the leap pad is equipped with a camera, but it takes such bad pictures, your child will probably not want to use this feature more than once.  second, on the pet app, your child can wash his/her pet which involves, among other things, blowing into part of the device to dry off the pet, which the kids think is fun, but i find a bit bizarre.  i don't know whether the germ factor bothers me more (especially since it's designed to be shared among up to three kids) or the fact that it's eerily like a breathalyzer.",Negative, 0.2058823529411765,happy opportunity glad good ease ready right rest give satisfy curiosity relieved right giving connect decent useless touch order pretty impressed able pretty happy new properly problem problem junk simplistic repetitive involved create involved moving free insulting touch mistake cheaper better kind expensive easily progress give learning learning appropriate learning exploration discovery pretend play well isolated play modern simple better free extra better bad fun bizarre bothers like,Positive

"this game is very poorly constructed.  the red part snaps together but frequently the pieces slid apart from one another.  nine sticks are required but they include a &#34;bonus&#34; stick - you can guess why.  two broke within half an hour.  also, if you're interested in game mechanics, this is not so much a game as an activity.  you roll the die and push the sticks in that many clicks (the die goes up to 3) and try not to pop the balloon.  there's really not much to it - super simple.  as you can imagine, it digressed after about 2 complete games into just playing with the balloons, or trying to pop it with the sticks.the other really silly thing is that you have to blow up the balloon while it's in the contraption and they say to use a pump, which they don't include.  you can blow it up normally but it's pretty awkward.  the one thing i did like is that you don't have to tie it in a knot because of this slot they have on the bottom.  that was kind of cool.overall i really can't recommend it, though i would imagine it would suit some audiences.",Negative, 0.5,poorly broke interested die many die super simple silly blow blow pretty awkward like kind recommend,Negative

"this is a really weak offering from lego. what happened is this: they released a far superior version of jabba's sail barge back in 2006 (lego number 6210) and it became a very popular set after it was retired. so, naturally they wanted to re-release the set in some form. instead of improving the set, however, such as what lego did with sets like jabba's palace 4480 (which became the much better 9516), lego decided to release a vaguely similar (yet worse) set in order to shamelessly capitalize on pent-up demand for a sail barge set. the result is the set you see before you. it is less faithful to the design of the sail barge in the 1983 film than the 2006 set, and the minifigure selection and piece count are fairly weak for a $120 set as well. in short, i highly recommend that you pick up a nice used set (or new if you don't mind paying a lot extra) of the 6210 version. they are selling for only a little more than this set on the used market and they are a much better design. don't even get me started on the fact that this set lacks a sarlacc pit; what a wasted opportunity. this is an overpriced and underwhelming set and i recommend avoiding it.",Negative, 0.30434782608695654,weak superior popular improving like better worse order shamelessly faithful fairly weak well recommend nice new extra better lacks wasted opportunity overpriced recommend,Negative

"i wish i hadn't bought this behemoth at this point.  the voice recoginition is a joke.  i use fluency to dictate at work and microsoft's voice recognition is so inferior it is laughable.  one of the few games i have, dead rising 3, was constantly crashing when i played it.  after searching forums/blogs, i found out that it probably was because i played the game while it was still loading (which by the way took forever).  so i had to delete the game, lost my save data, and then install the game, install the update for the game (also huge) and then i could play it without crashing.  plus, my biggest annoyance is that i thought that the xbox one was supposed to be better about not having you watching downloading and installing bars cross the screen.  now granted i don't play it a lot.  i'm a busy physician and there aren't good games.  but everytime i turn the thing on it makes me download some enormous update and then install it.  or when you put a new game in you have to wait for it to load (obviously all the way based on my dead rising experience).  when you only have an hour to play before bed after you get the kids down and you spend half of it doing these updates or loading a game, it's pretty disappointing.  also, the thing is just glitchy.  i've had issues with the controller and the unit having communication issues with each other which never happened with my 360 and you can tell the controller has thinner, flimsier plastic than the 360 controllers which would be fine if it were cheaper. plus i no longer run my directv through the xbox one which was supposed to be some wonderful function because it has a much less user friendly menu when you do this, it made our dvr mess up where it would take 2 or 3 seconds before it would fast forward with the 30 second skip and when you hit that button 6 times during a commercial break it's pretty annoying to have 12 or 15 seconds of just wasted time, and worst of all it clearly made our picture worse on our tv.  i took the hdmi cable and plugged it straight into the tv from the dvr and then through the xbox one into the tv and there was clearly a less crisp, duller, washed out picture.  it wasn't even tough to see the difference.  my wife clearly noticed it and that isn't something she even claims to care about.  and now microsoft slaps me in the face and the kinect that i just had to have as an initial buyer because it was ""so integral to the xbox one and it's future"" is not not necessary at all and in fact i got to pay $100 for the privelege of having something that was even slowing my gpu down by 10% potentially making the graphics worse according to an article i just read.  all i can say is next time microsoft makes a console, i will absolutely not make the mistake of being an early adopter.  lesson learned.  wow, i sound so angry.  believe me, you don't spend $500 and not want to like something but ms just failed on a lot of levels to deliver here.",Negative, 0.38596491228070173,joke work recognition inferior laughable dead crashing still lost save huge play crashing annoyance better play good enormous new dead experience play pretty disappointing issues communication issues thinner fine cheaper wonderful friendly mess fast break pretty annoying wasted time worst clearly worse clearly crisp tough clearly care integral future worse time absolutely mistake wow angry like failed,Negative
"lets cut to the chasecons:1.) its $100 more than the competing console (ps4)2.) the feature that is to warrant the $100 (kinect) barely works. ign actually voted the ps eye for ps4 to work better. i can't say if it does or not, but i can tell you that the kinect is not good.a.) voice commands only work if it is completely silent. a game or movie can't be playing very loud or else it doesn't work.b.) when it is silent, commands work around 65% of the time. its embarrassing to use in front of company. waking it up is always at least two attempts. i don't speak with an accent.c.) using your hand to guide yourself is even worse. with excellent light, it will find you decently if you are less than 8 feet away from the sensor. to select something you need to hold your hand on what you're pressing and then push forward. no matter how many times i try, it always pushes outward from what i'm pressing towards instead of pushing it like its a button.d.) almost every game poorly implements all of the features. from some combination of fault, you never get what you want and you're always repeating yourself. if the kinect manages to sign you in by your face, it doesn't really matter, because every game i have asks me who i am when i start it up even though i just signed it with my face 10 seconds prior.3.) the graphics are without a doubt inferior to the competition. mostly its negligible for those with less than 60"" screens, but the ps4 is $100 cheaper and the stronger of the two. again, the kinect does not warrant an extra $1004.) ps4 is already offering free games every month for ps plus subscription. xbone has released a demo for killer instinct (which is insanely boring and a pretty undisputed flop)these 4 points are huge reasons not to purchase the xbox one over the ps4. there is literally no advantage that i can think of. the graphics will always lag because some of the power is allocated to the kinect at all times, and not to mention, the ps4 already has superior hardware. thats a bad combo. they could one day match the ps4's price, but i don't see it happening. number 2 was advertised to work much better. i watched a demo where they recorded audio from a room and you couldn't decipher a single thing. then it played back kinects isolated audio of the gamer and it was perfectly understandable. this has not been my case. maybe they will update it.  3 will always remain. it just doesn't have the horsepower ps4 has. as for 4, they claim they will start offering free games. hasn't happened as of yet.also,hbogo doesn't exist like it does for 360there are rampant problems with comcast internet that doesn't exist on other consoles (streaming video is sketchy as well as multiplayer)pros:1.) if this has the games you want, this is your console. for me it does, so i bought it.2.) set top box functionality is nice.3.) if they can get the kinect voice functions to work 90% of the time, it will be completely worth the $500 asking price. i have hope.i'll update this if there are changes made, but i can't find them in any of the future builds that i've scoured the internet for.2 stars because it might have the games you want and youll just have to deal with it costing more than the ps4 for no reason as of yet. this is going to make some xbox fans really unhappy, but try to think. if you don't voice your opinions about these little problems, nothing gets fixed. there is no incentive for the manufacturer. use your heads",Negative, 0.3157894736842105,works work better work silent loud silent work time embarrassing guide worse excellent light many like poorly fault start doubt inferior cheaper stronger extra free killer insanely boring pretty undisputed huge advantage lag power superior bad work better isolated perfectly understandable start free like rampant problems sketchy well top work time worth future reason fans unhappy problems,Negative

"ironically, as i was writing my review my pc had to turn back on to install windows 8.1 update which supposedly fixes a lot that is wrong with win 8.  the update keep saying almost there, yet it took over an hour for an update.despite my trials and tribulations with microsoft i decided to get the one only because it was supposed to be better for kids, and i have a young son.  so i thought it would be a perfect match, especially with the kinect to show movement and follow voice commands.the system arrived and right after setup the system froze, then froze again.  i downloaded the free, trial edition of the sports game, but sure enough that didn't work because it said the kinect couldn't get a clear view of my room.  seriously? a $500 video game system that couldn't see my room &#34;properly&#34; despite being placed in the exact recommended spot and a large, open room.  it wouldn't even attempt to play the game...just gave me an error every time.as far as the great entertainment available, it's only available if you fork over about $100 to microsoft for a gold account, every year.  and honestly what you get after shelling out that much money to ms isn't much: skype, which is free elsewhere, hbo go, also free elsewhere, some short kinect exercise games, and ms movies and music, not nearly as good as itunes or amazon.  the tv guide/ control isn't that great either--can't control your dvr, and the best case scenario, you can watch tv on a half screen and play a game on the other half.  although if you want to do that doesn't it defeat the purpose of the game.then, lets get to the kinect, the other big &#34;selling feature&#34; of the one.  the voice control was pretty decent but more of a gimmick than anything else.  i was losing my voice by the end of the night from all the yelling at kinect.  just about everything you can via voice you can do simpler and faster by pressing a button.  the gestures recognition was a joke.  over half the time it didn't even recognize my hands.  it was an exercise in frustration and i cannot believe a major company would put out a product as glitchy and faulty as the gesture recognition is--it is a joke!now, the motion recognition could be something great, kind of like the wii; however there are almost no games that take advantage of it.  in fact, there are very few games to begin with for the one.  and all my thoughts of this being a great game system for kids were squashed when i realized there are no games right now dedicated for young kids, and the kinect is really a gimmicky joke.unless you want to fork over $100 every year to microsoft for &#34;apps&#34; which are free elsewhere, you can forget about this being an all in one entertainment system.  then you realize the kinect is a joke, you are down to a game system which frankly loses to the ps 4 in nearly every category.  i cannot comment further on ps 4 because i haven't used it yet, but i do know the xbox one is like most things from microsoft: big, bloated, intrusive and overpriced!  yes many people are concerned with the kinect that microsoft can monitor you and with many tech companies more than happy to fork over your records to the nsa, it is concerning to have a company which can essentially spy on you at any time.realize that many people pay extra to get an apple computer just to not have to deal with microsoft or windows.  windows phones are a joke and will soon fall out of the marketplace, and i'm afraid the xbox is just another over-complicated product from microsoft which isn't really about fun but more about microsoft milking you for all it can.  what ms was trying to do before the xbox one was even released was disturbing--thanks to the tremendous backlash they finally gave up on their devious plans.  the one had a lot of potential but sadly ms was more focused on rushing out a glitchy, gimmicky product that it could use to try to sack consumers in as many ways possible!  so in the end the one ended up being a real zero with me and i returned it!",Negative, 0.3037974683544305,ironically wrong win better young perfect movement right froze froze free enough work clear recommended open play error great available available gold free free good guide great best play defeat purpose pretty decent gimmick losing simpler faster recognition joke time recognize frustration major faulty recognition recognition great kind like advantage great right dedicated young gimmicky free joke loses like bloated intrusive overpriced yes many concerned many happy many extra joke fall afraid fun devious sadly gimmicky sack many real,Negative

"we bought our daughter her first innotab the christmas that they were first released and it was her favorite gift. from the start, i was never a big fan of the touch screen since it was nowhere near as responsive as even a cheap smartphone touch screen, but my daughter was happy with it, and it kept her busy for hours. biggest complaint for me was that it ate batteries, and the only other option was to tie her down with a power cord.her camera broke shortly before the following christmas, and the updated innotab offered its own camera so we bought her and her two-year old sister each their own innotab 2. the innotab 2 was a mild improvement over the previous version, with a camera, microphone, and a few new apps. turning the tablet on, the innotab 1 would load to the user menu in 16 second, while the innotab 2 took 26 seconds. overall, it seemed a bit more sluggish, but it had a camera...now, the innotab 3 if finally here, and i was actually looking forward to what they'd offer this time, hoping for a bit more of an improvement over the innotab 2. no such luck, as the specs on paper were not impressive. 5"" screen was reduced to 4.3"", slightly improved camera, and a control pad.overall design: the innotab 3 is, like the previous innotabs, very well built... solid, and looks like it could take a few drops without issue. the new innotab is smaller overall then the previous innotabs, however even when my youngest daughter was 2 years old she had was able to handle the larger innotabs just fine. not sure if the smaller design is a positive or negative change. the first two innotabs sported large corner bumpers made of rubber-coated plastic... the innotab 3, due to its reduced size, no longer has the large bumpers and instead have a sliver of rubber on each corner. it remains to be seen if these reduced bumpers will greatly reduce the ability to absorb fall damage.the buttons were also redesigned. they use to have three large buttons for on/off, home, and taking a picture, along with five smaller buttons that were flush with the case and easy to press... screen brighter, screen darker, volume up, volume down, and help. the innotab 3 has only five small buttons for on/off, volume up, volume down, help, and home. they replaced the camera button with an on-screen button that doesn't work anywhere near as well... we've found we had to press the on-screen button several times before it would take a picture. never had that problem with the innotab 2's dedicated button. they also dropped the screen brightness buttons, however i don't think my kids ever used them. in addition, the new smaller buttons are concave and aren't as easy to press. my daughter specifically said she didn't like the new buttons, and although the innotab is not designed for adults, my wife and i hated them.one new addition is the 4-way control pad. i didn't like it because it feels a bit sloppy. my daughter never used it... not sure if it'll be more useful in future games.screen: by far the biggest change from the innotab 2 is the reduction of screen size... when everything is getting bigger and bigger screens, vtech decided to go in the opposite direction, reducing their screen size from 5"" to 4.3"". (leapfrog increased the size of their leappad screens from 5"" to 7"" this year.) the screen looks a bit sharper, but my wife and i were very disappointed with the reduced screen size. in addition, the video playback seems a bit unnatural. side by side, the innotab 2 screen looks smooth, but the innotab 3 looks a bit jumpy, like it has a lower refresh rate. not sure how many other people would notice it though.another major problem with the new screen is the reduced viewing angle. with the innotab 2, the screen looks good straight on, but loses a bit of detail and contrast as you turn it. viewing from a 45-degree angle at any direction, you can still clearly see the screen. the innotab 3 looks good when viewed straight on, but darkens as you increase the angle of view. at 45-degrees, it's almost too dark to see.after giving the innotab 3 to my daughter, she was not happy with the screen size at all. along with the buttons she didn't like too much, she opted to go back to her innotab 2 after about an hour of playing with it.overall, the screen is nowhere near as good as the innotab 1 and 2. i have no idea what vtech was thinking when they made this change, but it was a really bad idea, in our opinions.camera: despite the 'upgrade' to a 2.0mp camera on the innotab 3 from a 1.3mp camera in the innotab 2, the camera is clearly worse. my wife and i both took pictures with both the innotab 2 and innotab 3. after sorting through the pictures, every single picture on the innotab 3 was much darker, being able to see much less detail, even after transferring them to a pc. taking a picture of our black dog on the innotab 2, you can see a few features on her... on the innotab 3, she looked like a black blob on a dark background. very, very disappointing. my daughter had a lot more trouble with it, as trying to click the on-screen button (that doesn't respond very well) caused a lot of the pictures to be blurry.by the way, the new camera is referred to as the 'wonder cam', as it now has a couple of options such as frames you can add to photos, however these options are disabled if you increase the size of your photos in the settings menu.software: the software is pretty much identical to the innotab 2, with addition of one game, 'magical bean stalk'. comparing the apps side-by-side between the innotab 2 and 3, everything looks the same. the music player and video player still have very limited options and are ultra-basic in features. the user menu screen appears three seconds quicker, and a few random actions that were clocked have shown the innotab 3 is very slightly faster then the innotab 2, but i doubt i would have noticed it without a stopwatch.the day after we received our innotab 3, we had some family and friends over and took the opportunity to pass around the innotab 2 and innotab 3... every single person thought the innotab 2 was a better tablet.back when we bought the first innotab, we put a lot of thought into whether we should get the innotab or the leappad. looking back, i think we probably made the wrong choice. the innotab has trotted along and has now clearly taken the turn towards 'cheaper' and 'simplier', while the leappad's price has increased, but has the added enough features each year to make it worthwhile.overall, the innotab 3 is certainly no improvement over the innotab 2. my daughters will stick with their innotab 2s for now. next year, i doubt my older daughter would be interested in an innotab 4, but i'm sure my younger daughter would be. i hope by then they actually come out with an improvement over the innotab 2, or else we will be leaping over to the leappad...",Negative, 0.23728813559322043,favorite gift start touch responsive cheap touch happy complaint power broke mild improvement new sluggish time improvement luck impressive improved like well solid like issue new able fine positive negative change fall easy brighter darker help help work well problem dedicated brightness addition new easy like new hated new addition like sloppy useful future change direction sharper disappointed addition unnatural smooth jumpy like refresh many major problem new good loses direction still clearly good dark giving happy like good idea change bad idea upgrade clearly worse darker able like dark disappointing trouble well new wonder add disabled pretty addition magical still limited quicker faster doubt family opportunity better wrong choice clearly cheaper enough improvement doubt interested hope improvement,Negative

"i am not at all impressed by this tablet. the screen is small and does not interpret gestures the way we are now used to, the processor is incredibly slow by modern standards, the camera is so crappy it's a joke, and the cartridges and software are too costly. yes i know i'm looking at it through the eyes of an adult... maybe a kids won't notice the small screen. maybe kids won't mind the slowness, until they reach about 5 years old. beyond that, i think they will be sharp enough to become impatient with it too.i don't know how, in 2013, you could even come up with something this slow. you try to go anywhere from the ""home"" screen, and you have to look at some spinning ring of dots for 6 seconds or more. then you want to back up to ""home"" again, another 6 seconds. this is really annoying when the tablet misinterprets your touch and goes someplace you never wanted to go in the first place. they must have had to hire special slowness engineers to develop custom circuits this pokey. the web browser seems especially slow, taking minutes to show pre-selected sites i can find in seconds by google search on my desktop pc.the camera is so bad, indoors it is almost like looking through the dark filter in a welder's helmet... only light bulbs and bright white or yellow objects are even visible. outdoors on a sunny day it takes recognizable photos, but of very poor quality. they claim it is 2mp, but it is not even remotely close to my old 2mp nikon camera. i contacted vtech about the camera, and they replied some nonsense about trying different batteries. well i've got their special rechargeable battery packs, and everything besides the camera seems to function sorta ok; maybe i could stick pins in a voodoo doll instead and have the same chances of fixing the problem.i installed the ""learning lodge"" software on my desktop computer. after a rather lengthy installation, it seems to function ok. through it i got the one free software download, plus purchased another of similar value (about $3) and a set of songs that cost about $5. the $3 things are very lame; one consists of three short nursery rhyme songs accompanied by horrid crude cartoons that resemble paper cut-outs dangling from strings, and the other is a ""math magician"" whose mouth movements do not match his words. the $5 song set is 11 short songs, averaging a little over a minute long each, accompanied by a kaleidoscope-like moving color screen. the tablet also accepts cartridges, and one came with it. the one they included has three things on it: a short story about a dog that is read aloud by a voice and has some interactive cartoon features, a simple maze game, and a coloring book type activity. these things are actually ok as far as they go, but i see the price of additional cartridges is up close to $25 each. in my opinion, you are not getting a lot of value for your money with these cartridges and downloads. you could easily spend an additional $100 just to bring this tablet up to something reasonably well equipped to keep your kid entertained off and on for a few weeks.this tablet reminds me of a brand new tandy ""color computer"" i received free back around 1992. it might have been a great thing in 1985, but by 1992 it was so outmoded that i quickly realized that sinking any money into software or accessories was just foolish. in the present situation, my advice would be to wait until your kid was slightly older maybe, then get a good cheap 7 inch android tablet with a damage warranty plan. there are so many apps now available, there has got to be stuff suitable for kids out there. i bought such a tablet, an agptech, from amazon a year ago for under 85 bucks delivered and my only regret is the lack of bluetooth. it is tons faster and more versatile than this innotab. our daughter is only about 1 year old; i'll let her beat this innotab tablet around, but doubt i'll be buying any more software for it.",Negative, 0.4098360655737706,impressed incredibly slow modern crappy joke costly yes beyond sharp enough impatient slow annoying touch special pokey slow bad like dark light bright poor quality nonsense well special ok learning lengthy ok free value lame horrid crude moving simple ok value easily reasonably well new free great outmoded sinking foolish good cheap damage many available suitable regret lack faster versatile doubt,Negative

"my boys loved this car maker.  they learned all about injection molding and had a fabulous time christmas morning making cars.  they don't actually get to do too much of the process because the maker does most of it, but they didn't mind at all.  this was all they wanted to do on christmas morning...until it broke not once, but twice.  my son learned that if you don't load the wax sticks point first, two wax points will end up touching inside the first chamber and slip off of each other when you're trying to press the sticks in.  this creates a jam of two sticks stuck in the first chamber and no way to push them into the melting chamber.  the jam occurred where you can't easily access the sticks, so it took a long time for my engineer husband to fix the problem.  sure, my son should have loaded the wax with the point first, but this is a toy for kids--mattel should have anticipated things like wax jams would happen and at least create parental access to the chamber or at least make it harder for a wax jam to occur.  the wax sticks have tiny tips--it really isn't apparent the tip should go in first.  lesson learned.so, the first jam was repaired by my handy husband who designs things for a living.  my kids proceeded to make a half dozen more cars when the car maker broke...again.  who knows what's wrong with it this time.  my husband says he'll look at it later because the last repair sucked up an afternoon.  this toy should be more durable.  i don't spend $40 anticipating a toy will last an afternoon.  i was also lucky enough to find wax refills, so i dumped $25 on those, plus $10 on another mold set.  in total, i spent $75 on a toy that lasted a day.  not good, mattel.also, amazon won't let me return the car maker because i purchased it at the end of october from their holiday toy list for my kids for christmas.  what that holiday toy list didn't mention was that amazon's christmas return policy of a january 31 return deadline didn't start until november 1st.  so even though i purchased the item from their holiday toy list that was out at the end of october and didn't give the toy to my kids until christmas, i am unable to return it because 30 days has passed from my purchase date.  thanks, amazon.",Negative, 0.4285714285714285,loved fabulous time broke jam stuck jam easily time problem like create jam jam handy living wrong time hell sucked durable lucky enough dumped good start give unable,Negative

"we have a lot of micro drifters and some of the race sets like the motorized super speedway and design speedway. my grandson and i have lots of fun with these.so i decided that this looked like fun too. well, the toy works some times. it uses kid power to hurl the cars up the ramp by pushing on a knob. on the radiator springs side of the toy, they have a flat surface attached at the top of the upward ramp. many times it seems the car hits it and slides back down. i took it off and the cars went up cleanly most of the time, but you run the risk of cars flying off the product this way.the toy has one trick it does. when it is in radiator springs mode if you go down the center lane the track flips to a piston cup speedway. the top half always flipped for me using the the lane director as the trigger. the lane at the bottom uses a brown flap that unlocks the lane and a gray director to trigger flipping the lane. it flipped maybe once every 10 times for me, leaving the track inoperative since the parts do not match when only the top half flips. it leaves a giant gap. once it flips to the piston cup speedway, it stays there. i found that the blue lane has a blue tab that is triggered by the lane director. i took an emery board and shaved a couple strokes at a time until it worked. about then, the kid powered booster fell apart. after digging a small metal piece and the gray plastic piece that fits on the end of the screw drive from the bottom of the housing, i put it back together, but it seems like it isn't as powered as it was before. doesn't seem possible but it does. since there is a small cylindrical metal piece holding the end of the spring together, i can see why it fell apart. if you push down on the button without allowing it to come all the way back to the top, it looses tension and the metal piece can work its way out. if they spent an extra nickel and screwed it on, it wouldn't fall out. lastly, i tried many different cars on the track. i had less than stellar results getting the cars to traverse the track consistently. many times they turned sideways and were stuck or just wouldn't go up the up ramp and slid back down. this was such a downer product, i placed it in the trash.the motorized super speedway is a far superior product.i have rated other toys in this series very highly so i am disappointed with this one. maybe your luck will be different. if not, i think i have given some tips on how to get it working if you have the same problem.",Negative, 0.275,like super fun like fun well works power top many cleanly time risk trick top top time worked fell drive like fell allowing top tension work extra screwed fall many stellar consistently many stuck downer super superior disappointed luck problem,Negative

"when they were sitting around, thinking ""what new toy can we come up with?"", on paper, this must have sounded like a great idea - kids can race their favourite cars movie characters around a track which flips between willy's butte and the piston cup race. what's not to love, right?unfortunately, what emerged was something flimsy and poorly executed....and i'd be upset at paying full retail price for it.so let's begin at the beginning.there was no clear easy-open option and after some tugging at the end flaps, i finally ripped the box open. it seems someone delighted in using something akin to superglue to seal the box with, so it took me approximately 2 mins to open the darned thing.next came sorting out the pieces and applying the stickers. this took an additional 18 mins to do.then came the assembly, which entailed deciphering the single sheet with all pictures (no text). this took an additional 25 mins to do. all told from when i when to open it up to when it was finally finished and ready to be used, 45 mins (so be prepared, those of you wanting to give this as a christmas gift).in case you're wondering at the length of time, i work as a supervisor for a customer care center for a large rta furniture company, so i'm not a complete idiot when it comes to instruction sheets or assembly of products.there is a pump on the toy that shoots the cars round the track. my one was, at first, jammed up. eventually, i grew frustrated with it and slammed it....whatever i did worked and it started pumping, rotating the mechanism.the flipping section of the unit is haphazard, flipping over when you least expect or want it to. i've yet to try using multiple cars on the track, but i had a hard enough time getting just one car to function properly on it. in all honesty, i found the piston cup race section easier to use on the car. i did manage to get the car to go round a few times on the track, although occasionally i found it flying off the track or sliding round on its side.i will be giving this to my grandson, although i suspect he will have a hard time with the pump, and will probably just push the cars around by hand. there is nothing of educational value in this toy (other than how to hit a pump, and in my experience that's hardly something that a child needs to be taught) and i'm somewhat concerned of the durability.i think it will have limited appeal to kids who are die-hard fans of cars (the movie). otherwise, i think it's probably best giving this one a pass, certainly at the price point at which it's being offered.",Negative, 0.2926829268292683,new like great idea love flimsy poorly upset clear ripped open delighted open open ready give time work care idiot frustrated worked haphazard hard enough time properly honesty easier giving suspect hard time value experience concerned limited appeal fans best giving,Negative

"my son has the disney/pixar cars micro drifters fast-flip carry case which goes with this and he loves it. this item, however, is not the best race track to get.first, it's a bear to put together. many different parts and stickers that don't really fit where they are supposed to go, make this at least an hour project for the parent. maybe more if you aren't good at matching up the diagrams with the instruction sheet, which is not an easy task. i'm not usually one who gets tripped up by instruction sheets, but there are a couple of items that look very similar and are easy to confuse on this one. also, one of the attachments was so hard to click together right, i spent 15 minutes, just on that one thing.when the track was finally together, we tried it out, but it didn't work exactly right. the cars tend to jam in the pump-action booster and by the third try, i was ready to give up. my son was eager to play, though, so he worked with it for about 20 more turns before the track actually ""flipped"" like it's supposed to. the track flip was pretty cool, but it doesn't work all the way. the round part of the track flips, but the arm that extends down to the booster only turns half way because it is too big to make a full circle without hitting the ground. for that arm to work, you would have to have two steady surfaces on other end of the track with nothing under that one arm so it could turn full circle. we tried that, but it still had trouble turning all the way around.you get one lightning mcqueen car for this track and the track only works with two cars. thankfully, my son had another car to use with it. basically, the first car goes and sets off a lever, then when the second car goes, the track will flip. without the second car, no flippage.another problem with this track is that when the cars are ""let go"" into the booster, they tend to flip over or go sideways, getting stuck in the booster. my son could not figure out how to get them out, so i was fishing them out about every ten minutes. at one point, the booster jammed (after about an hour of play) and we thought it was broke forever. there were no cars inside or jamming the system... after about 30 mins, it miraculously wasn't jammed anymore. after that first jam, it jams every once in awhile... probably about 3 times a day.a safety hazard is needed for anyone sitting next to the track. about every 3rd car will go flying off the track and land across the room. my son loves this, but if he were playing with another kid, he would be black and blue by now.all this said, my son still loves playing with it, because it is cars and because he gets to flip cars across the room, but it does not operate as stated.",Negative, 0.23684210526315788,loves best many fit good easy easy confuse hard right work right jam ready give eager play worked like pretty cool work work steady still trouble works problem stuck play broke miraculously jam safety hazard loves still loves,Negative

"we were so excited when we ordered this plane because what little boy doesn't love remote controls and airplanes. the design seemed rather ingenious--the child puts little wings on his hands, and extends his arms to remotely control the airplane. sounds simple enough, looks simple enough, and even a toddler could do it, right? uh, not so fast.first, the plane doesn't actually fly. sure, it tells you this on the box, but only in a print that is pretty darned tiny relative to everything else on the box. but the remote has to be easy enough to use, right? well, in theory, if you've got about an acre of pure, open space for your child to play in, this controller could work great. but in the backyard of my track home? not so much. in my house? not at all. the plane moves both too fast and in too big an arc to allow a kid to really control it. it seems like my son could barely get it moving before the plane would hit a wall or end up under the sofa. at first, i thought it was because he's just shy of two and still lacking in hand-eye-coordination. but then i tried it. and my 7 year old tried it. and my husband tried it. and none of us were especially successful at getting this plane to go in a straight line much less navigate through the house.all this wouldn't be so bad if we could just ignore the remote and play with the plane itself. but when we took the batteries out of the remote and just left them in the plane, it quit producing sound.the look of the plane is really cute, but this just isn't a practical toy for kids of any age.",Negative, 0.10344827586206896,excited love simple enough simple enough right pretty easy enough right well pure open space play work great fast allow like moving still lacking successful bad ignore play cute,Positive

"my daughter is 17 months and loves to watch me in the kitchen so i thought this would be a great learning tool for her and being fisher price, i had high hopes. boy was i disappointed! first of all, it was very easy to put together but the plastic feels so cheap and flimsy! she has knocked the entire thing down twice just by lightly pushing on it and it's not heavy at all to keep it in place so it's also not sturdy. another complaint i have is that the picture of the pie in the oven and the backsplash images are printed on cheap cardboard and are only held in by tiny tabs so my daughter has easily removed them and ripped one. kids can push right through them; fisher price would've been better off making these stickers to stick to the flat surfaces so they'd at least stay in place. the purple pan doesn't sit flush on the burner and while i like that it has little hooks to hang up the cups, there should be something to store the dishes and other accessories in instead of having to put them in the oven. but the most annoying part of this kitchen of all is that dora's voice talks nonstop and the child doesn't even have to do anything to make her talk - the things she says don't even correspond to what the child is doing. if my daughter is playing with the pans on the burners, it talks about the sink. where's the educational value in that? also, the spanish voice sounds muffled and you can't really understand it.the one positive thing i can say is that we do love the accessories and they are made of good quality. it comes with a spatula, cups, plates, pans, and play food such as chicken, macaroni and cheese, and eggs. but i'm sorry i just cant see that this is worth the $50 price tag - the quality is worth maybe $10 if that. so my advice is use the money you'd spend on this piece of junk and put it towards a higher quality set like thestep2 lifestyle custom kitchen ii, brown/tan/green. my nieces and nephew have this step 2 kitchen and it's totally worth the extra money because it's made of heavy duty plastic and is very sturdy and more life like. sorry dora, but your kitchen is terrible.",Negative, 0.33333333333333337,loves great learning disappointed easy cheap flimsy sturdy complaint cheap easily ripped right better pan like hang annoying sink value understand positive love good quality play food sorry worth quality worth junk quality like worth extra duty sturdy life like sorry terrible,Negative

"ever since more inexpensive r/c cars appeared, back around the 1980's, i've always wanted to try one. but it was never a big enough interest for me to actually lay down the money to get one. well now i finally have one, and frankly it is quite a disappointment.when i first tried this car out, it was so feeble that i was sure the included batteries were almost dead. so i bought new batteries, but it still has no power. you'd think a car with rugged suv looks and huge knobby tires could go through some rough terrain, right? wrong. obviously a $50 toy won't drive through a wheat field or a cattail swamp, but i had envisioned it chasing my dog around the mowed lawn. not even close. it gets hung up on a tuft of grass growing through a crack in the sidewalk. it does not even have enough power to go uphill on the slightly inclined but very smooth asphalt paved parking pad in front of my house.from a mechanical point of view, i expected this car to have a high-revving dc motor driving the wheels through a worm gear or other high reduction gear arrangement. instead it appears to be more or less direct drive, and rolls freely on any slight hill if neither forward or reverse is commanded. there is no ""engine braking"" effect. in light of that, it is not surprising to me now that the power is so lacking. where other reviewers comment on slow top speed, i myself would give up a bit of speed for some ""off-road"" capability.the battery compartments are held shut by screws, making battery changes a pain. the construction looks pretty cheapo, but i will admit the car has bounced off table legs a few times now without any damage.this is a fun car for kids... provided their friends don't all have something better. it is fun indoors or on a perfectly flat paved parking lot. and maybe my expectations were just unrealistic; i never had any other r/c car to compare it with. but i certainly would not buy another one.",Negative, 0.303030303030303,inexpensive enough interest well feeble dead new still power huge rough right wrong drive hung crack enough power smooth drive light power lacking slow top give pain pretty fun better fun perfectly unrealistic,Negative

"orbeez luxury spa / b00ci6jpnci'm really dreading this review, because i had expected to like this and came away really disappointed. full disclosure: i do not have children. i ordered this because the product description specifically called out that the item is also for adults and that ""even your mother or father can enjoy the orbeez spa experience"". i also have been *really* wanting a foot massager / pedicure experience, and i love the orbeez (we have some in vases) so i figured this would be fun and pleasurable.first: this spa-toy was a huge pain to setup. there are no batteries included, and it takes c batteries for the bouncy motor and lr44 button/watch batteries for the light show. we don't keep either on hand, but luckily we had some c ""adaptors"" from eneloop which turn aa batteries into c-sized ones. (this proved aggrieving later when the metal spiral in the battery case snagged on the adaptor case, but that's not the fault of the spa-toy.) the battery cases are screwed into place, with soft metal screws that tried to strip as soon as we touched them. coaxing the metal screws out of the plastic case was particularly difficult; we eventually had to insert a thin paring knife to ""lever upward"" while my husband gently worked the screw up. (at one point he seriously suggested breaking the case open because it was proving so difficult to open.)second: i should have anticipated this, but i forgot that orbeez have to soak overnight in order to plump up. some kid is going to open this and want to get to it right away only to be told they have to wait! that's not *such* a big deal, but these are the most delicate orbeez i've ever seen! we have some stronger ones in our vases, but these fall apart if you squeeze them too hard. i was super-careful with the spa, but even with my feet moving gently through the orbs, there were still bunches of shreds to strain off afterward. this leads me to believe that the orbs won't last long, which means having to buy lots of replacement packets, but also means that you can't get around the overnight soak by just keeping some always plumped and ready to go. so whoever uses this is going to have to always know several hours in advance that they want to use it.(there's also no cover for the spa, so if you leave the orbeez in the bucket, you'll need to place it high enough that smaller children or pets won't eat them. and you'll also want to store it somewhere where the kids can't knock it over and spill everything.)third: the bouncy / massagey area is one circular drum in the very center. it doesn't bounce the balls much, nor does it do a particularly thrilling massage. while the marketing says all sizes of feet fit in the bucket, you have to crowd your feet into the exact center to get the actual massage experience. the model they used in the instructions has her feet spaced a normal amount apart -- i can almost guarantee she's getting absolutely no vibration on the heels or toes, and only a partial amount on the soles of her feet. i find that very disappointing. i think this would work for small children, but not for people with larger feet. (i'm a us size 9, for the record.)fourth: the drum is fairly loud. we used it on carpet and on hardwood floors and it was very annoying to listen to in both cases. it also feels like it's shaking the entire toy, so i'm wondering how durable the plastic material is going to be over time.fifth: the orbeez are cold. well, no problem, right? the marketing specifically says: ""and get this, it now comes with a massage function, a warming feature and a light show."" so we'll just turn on the warming feature! except that the ""warming feature"" is you pouring hot water into the spa. if it gets cold, you dump the water out and pour in new hot water. i guess i shouldn't have expected an actual heating feature in a kids' toy, but i'm not really thrilled with having to turn off my foot massage, dry my feet, walk to the kitchen, wait 5 minutes for the sink water to heat up, and then pouring that in so i can resume my massage. i guess mom/dad/spouse is supposed to wait on you? except that you have to pour the cold water out before adding the hot, so either way there's not a seamless way to continue the massage once the water has chilled.sixth: buy refills. the spa comes with 15 packets of orbeez, and the instructions call for using 5 packets in the spa at a time. (though my 5 packets didn't make the spa look nearly as full as the marketing photos.) those 5 packets' worth looked pretty ratty after 3 extremely careful / gentle sessions with an adult trying to 'baby' the orbs. i would guess there's maybe 10-15 uses of the spa packaged here, and then you'll need to buy more. so if this review has made you whip out your wallet, make sure you also buy some orbeez replacements now while you're doing your holiday shopping.---as i said at the beginning, i really wanted to like this spa and was expecting to go easy on it because it *is* a kids' toy at the end of the day. but there's a lot about this that seems really shoddy and even sneaky -- i'm annoyed at marketing which calls adding hot water a ""warming feature"", which mentions that c batteries are required but doesn't call out the lr44s, and which pictures a model whose feet are placed incorrectly in a tub which is staged to look fuller than yours will. kids care about their toy looking like the marketing (or at least *i* did as a kid), and so that kind of bait-and-switch bothers me.and while i like orbeez and i love the concept, in the end this feels like a problem in search of a market; the glossy paper ad included in the box (in contrast to the black-and-white instructions) shows orbeez waterfalls and orbeez mood lamps and orbeez magic crystal balls and orbeez animal-shaped keychains. you get the impression that there's an warehouse somewhere full of surplus orbeez and they're churning out cheaply-made toys trying to desperately use them up. but if that's the case, why didn't they use the sturdy kind that we keep in our vase (and which break only under actual duress) rather than these flimsy ones that fall apart if you look at them wrong? i don't know.shorter version: i wouldn't buy this for a child (and i have nieces to shop for!) because of the frustrating setup and long prep time, the lack of storage for the orbeez, the noise of the motor, and the unpleasant aspects of the massage itself (specifically, having to hold your feet in the exact center and the coldness of the orbs). and i certainly wouldn't buy this for an adult, because while an adult could navigate the logistical problems better, they're more likely to want an actual massage and not a colorful gimmick. so take my opinion for whatever you think it's worth.note: this review is based on a free advance review copy of this product provided through amazon vine.~ ana mardoll",Negative, 0.3636363636363637,luxury like disappointed enjoy experience experience love fun huge pain light snagged fault screwed soft touched difficult knife worked breaking open proving difficult order open right delicate stronger fall hard moving still strain leads ready enough knock thrilling fit experience guarantee absolutely vibration disappointing work fairly loud annoying like durable cold well problem right light well hot water cold dump water new hot water thrilled sink water cold water hot seamless water time worth pretty gentle like easy shoddy sneaky annoyed hot water incorrectly care like kind bothers like love like problem magic desperately sturdy kind break flimsy fall wrong frustrating time lack noise unpleasant problems better colorful gimmick free,Negative

"this product seemed like a great idea to me---a plastic floor mat that you could color on with color magic markers.  my daughter has recently gotten quite into coloring, and always is wanting more paper and bigger paper, so this seemed like it would be a terrific way to give her that and then be able to erase and reuse the surface.  well, it would have been great...basically, the color magic markers just don't show up on the plastic.  you can just barely, barely see where you color.  and that is after the about 5 second delay there always is with color magic markets to see any color at all, making it very frustrating for young artists even when you can see the colors.  but in this case, anything we colored looked like the long ago shadows of something written on a whiteboard and erased---like the hint of an old picture left over.  the box shows kids coloring vivid pictures, and there is no way on earth you could do that with these markers.the set also included a little eraser---sort of the shape of a razor with a liquid in the handle that went onto a little sponge-like area where the razor surface would be.  this was supposed to erase what was colored, once you primed it.  it's ironic that always the colors barely showed up, this erase did very little to erase the minor bit of color there was.  it worked much better to use the enclosed washcloth, even dry.i'm trying to think of some positive here.  the mat did have good storage areas for the markers and washcloth, and it rolled up well.  if the colors had worked, it would be a good product.  i wish they had.",Negative, 0.24999999999999994,like great idea magic like terrific give able erase well magic delay magic frustrating young like vivid erase ironic erase erase worked better positive good well worked good,Negative

"while this toy seems like it should be appealing, there are some drawbacks that limit the appeal, and even to the extent it is appealing, it wears off rather quickly.  within an hour of opening this toy both of my daughters were at the table drawing on ordinary paper with regular markers.to begin with, this toy takes three aa batteries which are, of course, not included.  once inserted, the toy lights up with a series of different patterns, depending on how many times the child presses the buttons.  for instance, the lights can flash alternating lights, or light up from the center outwards or the outside inwards.  in the end, though, the different effects aren't distinct enough to keep kids' attention.  furthermore, the lighting effects are nowhere near as brilliant as the box shows (which my six-year-old daughter noted with due irritation).the toy requires specific gel markers which come with the toy, so when those markers run out/dry, you'll have to find other special ones (although i understand that ordinary dry-erase markers work as well, but those don't come cheap either).  also, it is rather difficult to completely clean the board for the next picture - you'll either go through a lot of paper towels or have to rinse out a cloth a couple times each time you need to clean the board.  and then the child has to wait until the board is completely dry before drawing again.  patience is a virtue, i suppose.finally, we found that the stand tends to pop out rather easily, causing the board to fall in mid-drawing.  to the extent they've used it at all, my kids tend to draw with it on the floor and then stand it up to watch the lighting effects.the one very positive feature is the built-in marker holders on the back, so at least you won't lose the markers.  they only hold the original markers, however, so if you get some other kind to replace those, they won't fit in the holder.our two daughters (ages four and six) have played with this toy only a handful of brief times each and even the friends and cousins we've had over have taken only a brief turn or two.i recommend skipping this product - it's too expensive for the minimal fun your children will likely get out of it.  i haven't looked at lite brite recently, but that was one of my favorite toys as a kid, and infinitely better than this toy - check into that instead.",Negative, 0.2058823529411765,like appealing drawbacks limit appeal appealing opening many light enough brilliant special understand work well cheap difficult clean time clean patience virtue easily fall positive lose original kind fit recommend expensive fun favorite better,Positive

"if you purchase this toy, it will be the most expensive lapdesk you have ever purchased for your child.  a better use of your money would be to purchase an actual lap desk, drawing paper, and washable markers.  my daughter is nearly two and she loves to draw.  typically, i put her in her highchair with some drawing paper and her washable markers and let her have at it.  i thought this would give her the opportunity to relax elsewhere and draw without me having to worry about the mess if she decided to decorate the furniture or something.  this, however, would not prove to be the item which would accomplish this goal.when i unpacked the desk, i decided to give it a go myself to see how it worked.  i was horribly disappointed.  i could barely see the faintest of marks on the board.  i wrote some words and challenged my husband to read them to me and he couldn't make out what i had written.  it was honestly that bad.  i thought maybe the board needed a bit of cleaning first, so i used the little solution and gave it a once-over, but that did nothing to help.  i have no idea how you are supposed to clean it once the solution runs out because i didn't see any refills.my daughter was bored within seconds.  once she saw that the markers left no mark, she asked for her other markers, so i set her up with her usual set.  i tried looking online for a different set of markers, thinking that perhaps i just had a set that was old or defective, but i cannot find another set.  i guess that when the markers and the cleaning fluid run out you are supposed to just plunk down a lot more cash for a new lap desk.  not gonna happen.so for now i just stashed this in our storage area and once she is mature enough to handle drawing on her own without constant supervision, i will let her use it as just a lap desk.  i could accomplish that for far less than the asking price of this toy.  i expect better of crayola and hope that they either remove this product from the market or do a big overhaul on it so that it actually works.",Negative, 0.28,expensive better loves give opportunity relax worry mess accomplish give worked disappointed bad help idea clean bored defective new mature enough accomplish better hope works,Negative

""morphix"", a gritty playdo substance, is pressed into various molds to build castles, knights and other items.  you use the provided playmat to stage your battle, and use this plastic catapult to lob morphix globs at your enemy's fortress.for me, almost everything about this process was frustrating, until the apocalypse we unleashed at the end. you see, after a good hour of castle-building we couldn't really succeed in knocking down each other's castle, even with a number of direct hits. i asked my son what his favorite part of the toy was and he said ""throwing my castle at your castle to knock it apart.""here are a few bullet points of frustration:-the instructions are minimal. we spent most of the first 15 minutes trying to figure out why the morphix was stuck in the molds, we couldn't get them out, despite vigorous banging on the play mat (which put dozens of little dents in it).  couldn't they give some tips on this and other related subjects?-the morphix itself is weird, and even after extensive kneading, still shed some of its sand/grit, which ultimately required a vacuum at clean up.-once you've made your shape and gotten it out, there's about an 85% chance it's going to get squished in some way within moments of getting it out of the mold.-the catapults will only toss something that's within a mm or two of an exact size, so stock up on ammo, and re-shape it frequently-you can't use the catapult with 1 finger like in the picture on the instructions.  you need both hands.-the morphix doesn't hold together after an hour or two, with handling pieces start to flake off.-there's no easy way to get the packaging back together after you're done with it.  it took both of us and a houdini-like flourish to get it all in there.... then a few minutes later when we found a morphix catapult bomb a few feet away, we both decided just to throw it out rather than risk having to pick everything up again.there would be so many ways to improve this toy.  i look forward to having my son play this w/ a friend of his and see how that goes.  i set the ""educational value"" to 3 stars, 2.8 of which are the educational value of how to deal with frustration.  overall 2.5 stars, an average of 4 from him and 1 from me.  time will tell, though, how often he/we come back to this toy.  right now i'm feeling like we keep the catapults and toss everything else.if i have anything to add upon future blissful playtimes with ""create2destroy"" i will.update 10/17:  it's been over 2 months since we played with this toy, and although i've left it prominently displayed several times, my child hasn't once asked to play with it again!",Negative, 0.3,honest hate patient patient time gritty frustrating apocalypse good succeed favorite knock stuck play dents give weird still clean like start flake easy flourish bomb risk many improve play friend value value frustration time right like add future blissful play,Negative

"let me start out by saying i am of the shrinky-dink generation - and puffy paint - and paper mache masks using white glue and newspapers (or globes using a balloon if you want to get fancy). i would like to believe that i am somewhat able to succeed at a kid craft especially when under the direction of a cool-under pressure able-to-whittle 9 year old, but i failed at this - mostly because i found it frustrating. the offspring persevered and was rewarded with some color swirl blobs pierced through the center and placed on the peacock stand alongside my puce colored beauties. they had lovely puce color variations within though.getting started:1) the peacock stand was assembled by the offspring in about 45 seconds sans instructions. it was simple and keeps the bead holes open while they dry. i have no complaints about the peacock stand aside from the fact it is now adorning my dining room buffet alongside her mantids and their required fruit flies. so yes, keep in mind this requires drying and space for drying...and may end up living in space you did not intend to populate with kid stuff.2) the roller apparatus is preassembled. we were up and running in under 5 minutes. we are girls who appreciate instant gratification and were happy with unpacking and mostly lack of extra packing materials (although i wish they used reclosable bags for the supplies)3) kit components include pink, blue, yellow, and purple clay, some pendant holders, clay punches, a device for hole poking, plastic clunky bracelet clasps, elastic and string (i am not clearly not employed in marketing).4) the instructions are... minimal... and clearly supposed to be written for the offspring's benefit (about a 3rd grade reading level, laid out fairly nicely) except they bounce around a lot (e.g. if you are making a swirl bead do steps 1-2 for regular beads, then swirl, then repeat steps 3-4...) - flattening position versus rolling position could have used a picture for the younger crowd. no instructions for round (obvious) and square (obvious enough for us, but maybe not for a younger child?) beads. a couple ok project ideas.5) i like the clay. it is vibrant and soft; it is not so messy or crumbly (just be aware of the ""may permanently stain!"" warning when choosing location).making stuff:1) we decided by committee that the pendants were clunky. most of this decision arrived from why do you have to flatten with the roller then smoosh it in the pendant holder. pointless - and clunky. we did not like clunky. however, these are easy enough to make, but remember there are only a few.2) onto beads: 1) choose 2 colors 2) use hole in crank arm of roller to size the pieces 3) roll the pieces and align them 4) turn roller to standing position 5) insert clay in back and crank away from you 6) put roller flat 7) put flattened clay in back and roll out - in theory the flattened piece will hit the bottom roller, push against it and coil.... which brings us to 8) take flattened coil out, repeat 7, repeat 8...  9) eventually put pressure on bottom roller have some success albeit with now puce clay 10) realize pressure did not work and manually start coils 11) realize it was easier (and less error/offset coils) to just roll by hand. 12) punch hole (no problems here but hole is big)  and 13) add to peacock rack to dry3) embossing clay: there are pretty designs lightly etched on the sides of the roller apparatus. according to the instructions you can use this to emboss your coils. however... they are so subtle that no matter how we tried the result in the clay was faint as to hardly see and then was marred as soon as we touched it. it could be there is a magic time during the hardening process that you can properly emboss the clay without cracking it using too much force. however, if this was meant for embossing the design should have been more prominent.6) glazing: subtle sheen and glitter. no problems - it is drippy so plan accordingly. the peacock holder was helpful for glazing. clear nail polish with added glitter i think would be cool to try.bottom line: i think there few supplies included for what you actually get - although i was for whatever reason enamored with the stand (it did not tip over and it actually worked). this is more of a ""getting started"" pack, but i could easily see a crafter using these up in one sitting. i found the coiling frustrating using the roller. the roller is good for flattening. i asked the offspring what she thought and she said it was fun to do with me but she thought it was kind of dumb and not anything she would wear (so maybe 9 too old?). she did not think this would be a good gift for her friends or her younger cousin (6). she thought her younger cousin would not be able to follow the directions and would not be able to roll the beads. maybe so. maybe not. ymmv. so for us, this was not a win as a rolling pin, toothpick, and better jewelry supplies would have gotten better results for less money. it is not worth the current list price. so, bottom line - no i would not recommend this unless the roller is modified so that it can grab clay better and has deeper embossing indentations. then...maybe for the 4-7 crowd.",Negative, 0.2345679012345679,start fancy like able succeed direction failed frustrating lovely simple open complaints yes space living space appreciate gratification happy lack extra clunky clearly clearly benefit fairly nicely enough ok like vibrant soft messy aware stain warning clunky pointless clunky like clunky easy enough success work start easier punch problems add pretty faint touched magic time properly glitter problems drippy helpful clear glitter cool reason worked easily frustrating good fun kind dumb good gift able able win better better worth recommend better,Negative

"as a marketing professional, i bring a critical perspective to products that others might see in a much simpler light.  take a crayon case, for example.  crayola, the king of crayons, thought consumers would love a case to hold 152 crayons.  i thought my kids would love it, too.  after receiving it and trying it out, i cannot help but think of all the cool things this case could have been, rather than just a yellow hunk of plastic that holds crayons.i normally like to point out all the great things about products, but this is an exception.  other than holding 152 crayons, this case really does not offer much.  instead, i will focus on all the things you will not find with this product, that would have been really neat.things i wish this case offered, but it does not:1. spinning/carousel base: it is impossible for a little one to see all the crayons that are arranged to face 4 different directions around the center of the case.  so, why not make the case rotate, rather than making the kid walk around it or pick up the entire case?2. grouping/organization: rather than 152 colors dispersed somewhat randomly, why not use the case to help bring some sort of organization to the colors?  for instance, there is one box that is full of metallics.  there is another box full of glitter crayons.  however, the only way i knew this was by pulling out the individual crayons and using deductive reasoning.  why not label the groups and do more groups to help make sense of such a large assortment?3. a lid with a clasp: there is a very cheap plastic lid with this case that i am certain will be discarded by most purchasers who think it is simply packing material--not worthy of keeping for the long haul.  however, if you don't keep that cheap piece of plastic, then you have no lid at all.  it would have been nice if they had thought about a case of crayons that will almost certainly be transported by a little one who might drop it.4. cooler sharpener: this case has a sharpener, but it is inconveniently located in the middle of the case, and it is sunken down low.  it really isn't even all that easy to see.  then, to sharpen a crayon, a kid must hold the crayon vertically and turn it.  sure, all of this is possible, but with a big case like this, a better solution could have been designed that is easier to access and use.5. refill friendly design: my kids use washable crayons, which do not come with this case.  however, the only way that i could put their crayons into this case would be to buy 16-count boxes of crayons, as this case is really only designed to hold that size of box (actually, there is one box in the case that holds 24, but the rest hold 16 crayons).  practically speaking, the life of this case is going to be pretty short if it is not easy to refill with one's own crayons down the road.in summary, if you are just looking for a throw-away plastic case full of 152 crayons, then this product is for you.  if, on the other hand, you are hoping for a case that is designed to stand the test of time and provide some unique and useful features and benefits for your little ones, you'll be disappointed like me.",Negative, 0.21621621621621623,critical simpler light love love help cool like great focus impossible randomly help organization glitter help cheap worthy cheap nice inconveniently sunken easy like better easier friendly rest life pretty easy time unique useful benefits disappointed like,Negative

"this is yet another crayola review i write, with two kids and the older (6 years old) being a huge crayola fan, this should not come as a surprise. how does this product perform then?for starters, the selling point is that this is designed for small hands and it is also mentioned this is supposed to be ""mess-free"". well, the size of the pad is just about perfect for a toddler, but it did feel just about right for my older kid (6)how does this work? after installing three aa batteries (not included, so keep that in mind if you get this) you should be good to go. on the back of the pad there is an on/off switch where you can select if you want color lights or color lights with music. just to give you an idea we do not use the music at all, it is just too loud and there is no volume control to change that, also, like with any other similar toys, it gets repetitive and eventually, annoying.the way this is built so it is mess-free, is that the pad is made of a dark blue gel covered by a thin plastic layer, so by using the included stylus you basically draw by removing the gel. this is very practical and clean but as you can imagine, frustrating: since the pad is made out of gel, it is practically impossible to draw without the figures deforming. also, once you've used it, there is no easy way to restore the gel completely. you have to manually spread the gel, making all kinds of shapes with your hands in the process.after watching my kids play with this for a while i came to the following conclusion: younger kids (1-2 years old) may feel drawn to the music and colors but not actually use it as intended. older kids who could use it to actually draw things may end up frustrated because of the issues caused by the consistency of the gel on the screen. i guess what i am trying to say is that this may work better as a baby toy, but there are better baby toys out there than this one.i am giving this item two stars, but i will also say there are other crayola products you can get on the same price range that may suit your needs better.one final comment, anyone else noticed how amazon warns about the choking hazard and mentions this is not for kids under 3? i mention this because the box in which this comes has a huge sign on the front suggesting this for 24+ months kids. the only choking hazard i could find was the stylus and yeah, i put the thing away from my younger kid.",Negative, 0.3,huge well perfect right work good give idea loud change like repetitive dark clean frustrating impossible easy restore play frustrated issues consistency work better better giving hazard huge hazard yeah,Negative

"the top surface of this toy is smooth. there's no way to see or feel where the 'buttons' are to activate various features. granted, it's pretty forgiving. you can tap anywhere on the animals, anywhere on the keys, to make sounds. but after a few seconds of watching a kid trying to tap the light next to the drum kit instead of the drum kit itself, even i was frustrated.as with most leapfrog toys, the voices are shrill and it defaults to being noisy and pestering. with a few taps, you can make it quiet so your child can explore the different musical notes and sounds, but unless you do, it's just an endless loop of noise.there are three modes, 'compose', 'song', and 'game'.compose is a sort of free-for-all. it starts with the 'guitar' loop playing, and kids can bang on the keys or the animals-with-instruments to add more noise.song encourages kids to touch the different instruments to hear little samples of sound, or they can touch an animal-with-instrument to play a song.

"i got this thinking that my 14 month old could not only handle it, but would embrace the smooth tactile-less 'ipad-esque' non features. maybe that was failure on my part, since he is well under the 3+ age range listed on the packaging. but, he loves the ipad or any phone he can get his hands on, so i thought this would be a good alternative.however, the smooth surface, while very responsive, doesn't give any visual feedback, (except for a few lights that light up). so lack of visual combined with lack of tactile, doesn't equal up to an engaging toddler toy. and my toddler simply wasn't interested, all he did was lift it up, set it down, slap at it and then walked away. no matter how many times i try to get him to enjoy it, he seems bored. it's cute, it has lights, it has no hold over his attention.the sounds are kinda cute at first, but quickly become an unbearable loop when you, or your child, aren't pressing on the correct answer or if it's being used in the free play 'compose' mode. and i think that's where the biggest failure comes in, it's hard for a disinterested child to realize the cause and effect of his actions on this toy, it's playing music practically non stop making it hard, to practically impossible, to tell which sounds you did pressing say the piano key, unless you know to listen for it, (and you know a small child isn't, well, not mine anyway!).unless you try this in person i would look for a different music option, i think the idea far outweighs the actual product. maybe in another year i'll pull it out and give it another try. but, i have a feeling even with age on his side there will still be far more engaging options.",Negative, 0.3235294117647059,embrace smooth failure well loves good smooth responsive give light lack lack engaging interested slap many enjoy bored cute cute unbearable correct free play failure hard disinterested hard impossible well idea give still engaging,Negative
"my daughter lives for music.  at the slightest hint of a song anywhere, on screen, in the car, off the ipad, she's up and dancing and singing.  any toy of hers that makes music is never far, except this one.  she played with it for about 15 minutes, and hasn't looked at it again.  i think a few factors may be the cause:1.  its not intuitive - its a flat panel toy, and different parts of the surface produce music when pressed.  the only hint that a given surface produces music is the graphics on the panel.  unlike most music-making toys that have graphic and a 3 dimensional design to indicate an engaging surface, there's not much to direct the player's attention.  yes, the graphics are quite cute, but there was no tactile response that involved my daughter (unlike pressing a button).  i suppose this is a bit surprising, given her ipad (practically glued to her) doens't have a tactile response either, but it doesn't work for her.2.  sound quality - is awful.  the embedded speaker is very low quality, and the sounds are muffled, with little audio fidelity.  i'm not expecting ipad-like sound quality (itself not great, but light years ahead of this one, albeit at orders of magnitude more cost), but the sound was so weak that it was hard to discern the different instruments.3.  my daughter is 3, which is the beginning of the recommended age range for the product.  it didnt hold her interest at all, but it makes me wonder whether they should revise the range down.  perhaps its more simple design would better appeal to a 2 y/o or so.",Negative, 0.14285714285714285,intuitive engaging yes cute involved work quality awful quality fidelity quality great light weak hard recommended interest wonder simple better appeal,Positive

"my five-year-old daughter seems to prefer the smaller dolls for play, so i thought this set would be perfect for her. size-wise, it doesn't take up very much space and the castle playset comes with everything your child will need to act out stories with the barbie characters mariposa and catania. my daughter has never seen the barbie mariposa movies, and it has no impact whatsoever on her enjoyment of the playset. she has fun making up her own stories and moving the small figurines from one part of the castle to another.assembly requiredfor the most part, the set is almost fully put together when you remove it from the box. i appreciated i didn't have to attach any stickers to the playset because i can never get them as perfectly aligned and as smooth as i want. the plastic the pieces are made from is pretty thin, and it might be possible to damage it if you aren't careful when attaching them. be sure to stick to the instruction's guidelines, because most of the pieces don't come out once you snap them in.the most difficult part for me was #2 on the instruction, affixing the pink top floor to the white columns. this was easily the most frustrating part for me; everything else was mostly straightforward, though there was confusion over which small decorative piece needed to go on top of the castle so the fairies could spin. overall, it took maybe twenty or so minutes to get it all put together and the loose pieces into the castle where the box shows them.tiny piecestruly, i'm surprised to see that this toy is recommended for ages three and up. there are so many tiny pieces for children to lose, and they could easily be swallowed by a child who has a habit of putting toys in his or her mouth. if you have older children at home as well as younger ones, keep this toy far away from the younger ones! also, you might think you are missing pieces in the set, but you aren't. the instruction guide says you have to attach some pieces to the bed, but upon closer inspection those pieces were already a part of the two beds. those additional pieces are shown as separate attachments on the front of the pretty-much-useless pamphlet. perhaps the biggest disappointment is the lack of a mirror for the upstairs of the castle. the box clearly shows one, so we thought we were missing a piece and i was going to write to mattel and ask them for it. however, on the instruction guide where it shows all the pieces, no mirror is listed. i don't know if there actually is supposed to be one, or if the instruction guide is wrong about this like it is about some of the other pieces too.qualitythe dolls included with this toy are a bit lower quality than i would have liked. they are barely a step up from the little plastic barbie dolls that i've seen in the impulse-buy area at the checkout at target. we bought our daughter one of those dolls once and pieces of her neck started to break off. of course, this upset my little girl. we glued the doll back together as best we could, but eventually i think the toy was thrown away. hopefully these dolls will not suffer the same fate; i hate seeing my daughter disappointed because companies don't put much thought into the quality of their toys.tipfor the spinner at the top of the castle, the dolls fit into them by snapping their chests to the seats. if you look closely, you'll see that the ""seats"" are shaped exactly like barbie's chest area, so that's where you snap them in.overallunfortunately, this isn't a must-have toy. it was aggravating to assemble, the quality of the toy leaves plenty to be desired, and the smaller pieces will be easy to lose track of if parents or child are not attentive to them.",Negative, 0.30769230769230765,prefer play perfect space enjoyment fun moving appreciated perfectly aligned smooth pretty damage difficult top easily frustrating straightforward confusion top loose surprised recommended many lose easily well guide disappointment lack clearly guide guide wrong like quality liked break upset best suffer hate disappointed quality top fit like aggravating quality easy lose attentive,Negative

"i liked the concept of this toy because it looked like it would offer my test kidlets a number of different play choices, but the reality turned out somewhat different.first of all, this toy must be played on non-carpeted surfaces.  to use the ""bottom"" level of the track, you need to have a hard surface otherwise the car won't be able to make a circuit of the inner course.  also, since the launcher is not attached to the device (so you can change the angle of entry) a hard surface is also needed to reach the upper course levels.second complaint, only one race car is provided with the toy.  it's hard to have a ""race"" when there's no one to race against, and you can't substitute any hot wheels or matchbox cars that you might have on hand.third complaint, the assembly instructions were not very clear and the letter-marks on the pieces were sometimes hard to see/find.  this isn't something that the kids can put together themselves.we never did ever get the car to run completely around the upper tracks, though it did make a nice figure-8 on the floor-level track.  we just couldn't get it to go fast enough to fully test the course.my recommendation?  save your money.  there are better toys out there.  this could have been a great toy if more time had been taken with the instructions, with the propulsion method, with the operation of the upper levels, and with the inclusion of at least two cars.  car racing sets are easy to create but few are created well.  the kidlets didn't play with this much beyond the first day, and now i just see pieces of it scattered among the rest of their toys.",Negative, 0.2,liked like play reality hard able inner change hard complaint hard hot complaint clear hard nice fast enough recommendation save better great time inclusion easy create well play beyond rest,Positive
"this track gets two stars from me because my son does think it's cool (he's almost four and likes cars,) he likes the car itself, and because we (adults) have gotten at least some of the functionality to work some of the time. however, he's never actually gotten it to work himself, so that i'm surprised he wasn't more disappointed. he's mostly ignored the track after the first 24 hours and played with just the car.putting the track together wasn't impossible, but it was a challenge and the instructions weren't all that clear. (""helpful hint"" to put on the stickers first would have been ridiculously hard.) it holds together well enough to work, but tends to start coming apart quickly if it's moved or if baby brother comes along.it was tough for me as a mom to figure out how to set up and use it; the instructions offer practically no guidance as to what it's supposed to do and how. my husband's the only one out of the three of us that's really gotten the car to loop the track. in fact, now that i look at other reviews, there are things i didn't even know it was supposed to do.one potential problem is that it has to be used on a hard, smooth surface - at the lower level the car runs on the floor rather than a track. carpet, rug or probably tile would be problematic.a final drawback i see is that it's a track to race cars, and of course only one car is included. to have a race you'll need to pick up another vehicle in the set, likedisney / pixar cars stunt racers raoul carouleit's designed to launch two cars at once, though you can do just one.amazon's description says that it's based off the movie planes. having seen cars but not planes, i really think it's based on cars; the car included is lightning mcqueen.",Negative, 0.3076923076923077,cool likes likes work time work surprised disappointed impossible challenge clear helpful ridiculously hard well enough work start moved tough guidance problem hard smooth drawback stunt,Negative
"i remember playing with matchbox cars and generic plastic tracks back in the 80s (everything was universal back in those days) and felt somewhat nostalgic when i had the opportunity to review the latest entry from the disney merchandising empire, namely the cars speedway.  course i, a 6'5 29 year old male with graying hair, would have looked really silly to my roommates trying to test this product by myself so i, as i had done with previous reviews on toys, enlisted the help of my neighbors, who have two children between the ages of 7-10 (i didn't ask, silly me) to test it out while i took notes nearby.  it didn't take long for problems to occur starting with assembly.the instructions were... well... crappy and exceedingly vague for anyone that doesn't assemble anything on a daily basis.  the mother, who is about as normal as blueberry pie (hehe, south pacific reference!), called me over within five minutes expressing frustration at what the instructions meant.  the pictures were somewhat confusing even to me, and i used to install home theaters and home appliances at best buy.  i had to violate my own prime directive of reviewing non-interference to assist the mother in construction and i quickly quipped that i certainly hope the writers of the manuals do not moonlight as 911 operators (""perform cpr by using your hands!"")even with my help, it took approximately 30 minutes to assembly what should've have been a 10-minute job and we came to an even worse realization after that.now, i'm not a parent but i've moved around enough and spent enough time at other friend's houses as a child to know that most children's rooms are carpeted.  it's a safety and comfort issue.  now, where does this fit into my review?  well, the product is basically a two-level track that starts on the bottom floor, that sits on the ground, and the cars are shot by a launcher up a ramp to the upper level or around a loop on the ground level.  problem is that the ground floor is little more than a plastic perimeter/guardrail that guides the cars and not an actual track.  also, there's a few inches of space between the launcher and the ramp to the upper level, meaning the car has to traverse across whatever surface it's sitting on (hardwood, carpet, your dad's back, etc.) before using the remaining momentum to ascend.in short, this thing does not work on carpet, ergo use in the vast majority of children's rooms.now, i was always under the impression that disney had one of the best marketing divisions in the world, and yet, they overlooked this little problem that even i, a non-parent, figured out almost immediately (hey, disney toy execs!  did i mention that i am available to hire as a full-time bonafide toy tester?  *waggles eyebrows sarcastically*).the mother and i quickly relocated the speedway, which almost fell apart in our hands as it is very flimsy, to the kitchen table after promptly evicting the father, who was trying to enjoy a quiet game of angry birds on his laptop.  after explaining the importance of testing the product to the angry father (""it's for science!"") we reassembled the tracks and were about to test it on the hard surface of the table with the kids when we ran into another problem.i handed the steve- er... lightning mcqueen car to the youngest and reached into grab another one for the other-... what the?  where's the other car?  the speedway only comes with one car and replacement cars cost... well... you can get a few matchbox cars for the same price.  this wasn't good as you can't have a race without two cars otherwise it's a time trial and this is hardly mario kart.  after a few seconds of thinking i asked the kids if they had any matchbox cars to see if they could be used as substitutes.  it was here that i found out why the cars stunt racers were so expensive; they're proprietary and have pull-back motors!  this means they are specifically designed for the track and vice versa so nothing else will work on the track as we learned very quickly.i see your tricks disney toy execs!  you clever fatherless people you!  this is how they tie you in to buy more stuff that is way overpriced and as flimsy as a bridge on the i-5!seeing how this was not going to work with two children and i was not going to travel to the nearest department store to spend money on more cars, we let the children take turns and they got bored within minutes as there was nothing more to do than turn an annoying crank and watch a single car do the same thing every time.  it became very repetitive and i can just imagine how long the flimsy power crank would last as it sounded like something from frankenstein with every passing turn.realizing that this toy would not last without a larger investment in more disney cars toys, i turned to the mother and asked a single question.me:  ""do you guys have a nintendo wii?""mother:  ""yes.""me:  ""mario kart?""mother:  ""of course!""me:  ""i challenge all of you!""kids:  ""challenge accepted!""i lost... darn kids...all in all, this product is little more than an attempt by what i can only imagine as a bunch of pudgy, balding disney toy execs to suck you in and buy more stuff.  this toy is annoying to assemble, flimsy at best, and requires a larger investment to even begin to enjoy.  avoid.",Negative, 0.41891891891891875,opportunity disney silly help silly problems well crappy exceedingly vague expressing frustration confusing best violate hope help worse moved enough enough time safety comfort issue fit well problem space meaning work disney best problem disney available fell flimsy promptly enjoy quiet angry angry hard well good time stunt expensive proprietary vice work disney clever overpriced flimsy work bored annoying time repetitive flimsy power like disney challenge challenge lost disney suck annoying flimsy best enjoy,Negative

"the idea of this track is that cars can run on the upper track or on a lower figure eight track. you place the car in the starting area, crank it up, and release it into the track. since there's no bottom panel, for the lower figure eight track to work at all, the toy has to be on some sort of hard surface, but it functions properly. the upper track is where we have problems. if the car is wound up enough to actually make it around the circle, it jumps the track every single time. there's a winner's circle that is completely manual. you press down a little wall to lock it in place, rotate the part out of the way, and then press a button to pop it into the way of the car so it's now routed into the circle. first, it's difficult for a child to time this and, after about three times locking the wall in place, it stopped locking which makes the winner's circle non-functional. so, overall, all we got out of this toy was a wind up car that runs figure eights on my kitchen table and is probably scratching the finish.as far as assembly, it took maybe 15 minutes and was fairly simple. i do like that the pieces snap tightly into place and stay put, unlike many other tracks. this is good since it will need to be carried up and down the stairs because we don't have hardwood floors and i want it stored in my son's room instead of on my kitchen table.",Negative, 0.23529411764705882,idea work hard properly problems wound enough time winners difficult time winners fairly simple like many good,Negative

"my kids are crazy for teenage mutant ninja turtles (abbreviated by my 3-year-old daughter as just ""turtles"" aka tmnt), so it was a no brainer when i saw this tmnt-themed game. it's for years six and up though, so it was probably a better fit for my six-year-old boy.when we got the game open the kids tore open the box.  and that's when i started assembling the tower.  the way the tower works is that it's a rickety set of plastic scaffolding, connected by pieces of stiff cardboard that have foot and grappling hook symbols on them.  these are all interconnected and balance on a single pivot point, which is a small plastic pole.  the game also comes with a measuring stick, a defeated ninja counter, four plastic tmnt bases (for each of the cardboard turtles), and a bunch of cardboard foot clan ninjas.  these ninjas all have a grappling hook design as well as slot to insert into a plastic base, so they can either stand on one of the footprints on the tower, or hang from one of the grappling hooks.  there's also a deck of shredder cards (the villain from tmnt) and a catapult to launch the turtles at the tower.there are two different kinds of games you can play with this tower.  the first is simply target practice: whoever knocks the most ninjas off wins.  using the measuring stick to ensure the players aren't too close to the tower, they take turns firing at it until all the ninjas are knocked off.the second game is more complicated.  one player manages the turtles and fires at the tower as above; the other plays shredder, managing the ninjas and moving them up the tower while searching for six special objects, presumably to summon some monster from dimension x. if shredder finds all six pieces before the turtle player knocks off seven ninjas, he wins.  don't worry though, earth is safe -- if this game has anything to say about it, shredder will never win. ever.on the surface this game seems like a tmnt-themed ants in the pants.  but in practice it's totally unplayable.  here's why: one does not simply place ninjas on the tower.  they have to be placed carefully, balancing a certain number on either side.  the ninjas distribute their weight differently by hanging vs. standing, so it requires a steady hand to add them to the tower without knocking them all off and starting over. this is nigh impossible for kids and a patience-testing exercise for adults.worse, because they are so precariously balanced, a sufficiently hard hit on the tower (totally possible with the catapult) can knock all of the ninjas off in one turn.  if you're playing the target practice game this isn't quite so bad, but makes for a short game.  if you're playing shredder vs. the turtles, the turtles win, always. and since the shredder player has to move several ninjas around every turn, it's highly likely the entire tower will get jostled and all the ninjas will fall.  this happened five times before we gave up.if the tower was a little sturdier and the pieces a little more solid, this could be a fun game for younger kids too. but as it is, this is just a frustrating exercise in ninja-tossing.",Negative, 0.33333333333333337,crazy better fit open open works connected stiff interconnected balance defeated well hang play wins complicated moving special monster wins worry safe win like steady add impossible precariously balanced sufficiently hard knock bad win fall sturdier solid fun frustrating,Negative

"my daughter's on a big ninja turtles kick right now. she picked out a tmnt backpack for first grade this year, as well as a tmnt lunchbox that she loves. when i saw this flying attack game, it looked like fun. we don't play that many board games (the main ones being nightmare before christmas operation and candyland), but i knew she'd be up for playing anything with the turtles. maybe it was the universe telling me that playing the game wasn't going to be a good experience, because for some reason, i held off until yesterday to finally open up the box and play the game.we played for about 10 minutes.hands down, tmnt flying attack is the worst board game experience i've ever had. it's worse than playing perfection when i was 5 years old, terrified of the timer counting down as i frantically tried my best to get all the pieces in before the game erupted. it's worse than when i'd play battleship with my neighbor when i was 10, and they'd only use one boat on the map instead of all of them. heck, that sounds like a lot of fun -now- compared to ever playing this game again. don't take my statement above wrong- when i say that we played for about 10 minutes, it was just that. we spent even more time trying to play this game. this whole board game is just a mess, that i don't have anything positive to say about it at all.so you build the tower, eventually, and you can play one of two ways. the first, and probably the only one you're going to try, is launching the turtles at members of the foot clan as they're hanging from the tower with their grappling hooks. the other method involves one person being shredder and the other playing as the turtles. shredder's trying to get a couple of key objects to start doing some evil business, and it's up to the turtles to knock 7 foot clan ninjas off the tower before he can do it. luckily for them, shredder won't win. as another reviewer pointed out, it's pretty much impossible for shredder to even come close to winning.the key problem with the game is how poorly balanced the tower is when assembled. you're supposed to put a lot of the pieces wherever you want, yet when i tried to distribute them evenly, the tower would still lean. the green plastic rods that hold the tower up aren't that strong either, and there were a couple of times when they'd come apart just when i'd move the thin cardboard pieces onto them. it's hard enough getting the foot clan to stay 'hanging' from the tower as it is, and constant wobbling ensures they won't be there for long. the foot clan pieces are one piece of cardboard, including the grappling hooks they're holding, and it curves to allow them to hang. unfortunately, there's no slot to put the grappling hook side in, so the cardboard pieces are just hanging there with nothing to keep them in place. you can launch one turtle piece at the tower, and there's a good chance it'll have enough force to knock all of the foot clan down.that's where another problem lies though. only two of the turtle pieces we have were able to fit into the catapult properly. donatello and leonardo had no problems, but raphael and michelangelo wouldn't go into the slot for anything. why is the majority of this game made of cardboard? why not just make small plastic turtle game pieces like say, the candyland gingerbread men? is that too much to ask? they wouldn't even have to be that detailed or anything! 9 times out of 10, i'd miss the tower because it's hard to tell how far you should be from it, even with the measuring piece they included with the game.when we finished a game, my daughter went right back to playing with her monster high dolls, and i just left the game tower where it was. if she asks to play it again, of course we will, but i don't see that happening. i will give the game 5 stars in the educational value category, because this would make for an excellent example of what a board game shouldn't be. only buy this game if your kid is a huge, huge fan of the turtles, and if it's 1/4 the price it's currently at right now.",Negative, 0.3472222222222223,right well loves attack like fun play many nightmare good experience reason open play attack worst experience worse perfection frantically best worse play heck like fun wrong time play whole mess positive play start evil knock win pretty impossible problem poorly balanced evenly still lean strong hard enough allow hang unfortunately good enough knock problem lies able fit properly problems like miss hard right monster play give value excellent huge huge right,Negative

"it's true.  my daughter actually did ask me if i could give this no stars.  it's not really a no star item, but i can't go higher than two stars.basically, you start by setting up what is a really cool looking cut-out of sophia's palace.  it's pretty easy to set up, though you have to punch out a ton of window holes and then place the windows in the corresponding holes.  easy as it is, set up took a while.one player is princess sophia (not as exciting as it sounds).  she puts on a cheap plastic bracelet.  the other is the hider.  what follows are amazingly complex instructions for a game for the 3 and up set.  the hider pulls a tile from a stack.  based on the rather obscure symbol on the tile, the hider then hides either a charm or a friend tile behind a window.  sophia (who will be your daughter because no way she isn't being sophia!), spins a wheel which tells her how many windows she can open in search of a charm.  if she gets lucky enough to find a charm, she then hangs the charm from her bracelet.  eventually, you switch, replace the charms behind the windows, and then compare to see who got the most charms.  i've simplified the rules here.  i actually had to read them a few times to understand this much.now, i should say that my daughter is a sophia the first fanatic.  she knows every song by heart.  can recite the dialogue.  has the stuffies.  wants the costume for christmas.  has an amulet and tiara.  and she hated this game.my daughter's  complaints:*  the game is boring.*  the bracelet feels weird and in the show sophia wears nothing like this bracelet.*  the charms are hard to hang from the bracelet.*  you can't really tell what most of the charms are.*  there are too many windows.*  there is nothing in the game that actually has princess sophia on it.*  the hider doesn't get to be a character so is no fun at all.*  did she mention it was boring?so no stars from the resident sophia fan and two from her mother.",Negative, 0.3428571428571429,give start cool pretty easy punch easy exciting cheap amazingly complex obscure charm friend many open charm lucky enough charm hangs charm simplified understand fanatic heart hated complaints boring weird like hard hang many fun,Negative

"the princess sofia royal prep academy board game gets off to a good start.  the box looks nice enough and the royal prep academy inside, though tedious to construct, looks great when completed.  the bracelet and charms were a big hit with my 3 year old, despite not really having anything to do with the show.  once we got to the instructions, things went sharply downhill.the instructions are written poorly, perhaps to purposely distract the end user from realizing that there is hardly any point to playing this game.  the basic mechanics are one person (the hider) draws a tile and hides a charm or a character behind a window and the other person (the seeker aka sofia) flicks a spinner and gets 1 or more chances to peek into a window of the royal prep academy.  nothing is hidden at the start, so initially your 3 year old will have to get very lucky to find something.  you probably won't make it long enough for their chances at finding something to improve too much.  my 3 year old got bored of the game and we have not revisited the experience.  i would not recommend this game regardless of age or how much your kid likes sofia the first.  instead i would recommendfly and go seek game",Negative, 0.2777777777777778,good start nice enough tedious great sharply poorly distract charm start lucky enough improve bored experience recommend likes,Negative
"my daughter loves sophia the first.  i've been forced to watch the cartoon so much that i can sing the song and know all the characters.  i figured i would get a game that she'd love when of the appropriate age.  i have to say i'm quite disappointed.first and foremost, the number of pieces to lose is ridiculous.  forty four cardboard castle cutouts, sixteen cards, twelve little windows, eight trinkets, seven big windows, six skinny windows, three staircase pieces, two medium windows, one bracelet, one spinning arrow, &#9835; &#9835;and a partridge in a pear tree &#9835; &#9835;.  btw - recommended age is 3 and up.

"disney missed the mark on this princess sofia royal prep academy board game.  the biggest downfall of this is the fact that it really isn't very interesting or fun to play!  the idea is kind of like a one sided version of battleship, but the 'tokens' you hide aren't placed on the board all at once, but by direction of a card.  so, one person plays sofia and the other plays the hider.  sofia's job is to open windows and find objects for her charm bracelet. the hiders job is to pull a card (each turn) and follow the instructions (ie: hide a token in the window).  when all the cards run out, the players switch roles and after round two, they see who had the most charms on their bracelet.  you can see how that doesn't sound like the most exciting thing on earth, right?  as far as difficulty, this isn't difficult.  it's more frustrating, really, as you have to open windows multiple times because the tokens are placed so slowly onto the game board.  i don't think the fact you have to play this game twice to find one winner works in its benefit, either.set up is somewhat involved, as you have to push out all the windows (of which there are many) before playing the game for the first time.  the board is a hard cardboard and the pieces are pretty thin plastic.  i have a feeling these pieces aren't terribly durable.i can't recommend this game because i don't see it getting much (if any) use because it just isn't very interesting.  too bad, as i love the character of sofia.",Negative, 0.2647058823529412,disney missed downfall interesting fun play idea kind like direction open charm like exciting right difficulty difficult frustrating open slowly play winner works benefit involved many time hard pretty terribly recommend interesting bad love,Negative

"as a lifelong fan of the 1966 batman tv series, i bought these figures to finally own a piece of tv and cultural history. the final product proved to be less than perfect, but there are pros and cons to this controversial collection.not long ago, three different toy companies announced they would be producing lines dedicated to the batman tv series from 1966 which starred adam west and burt ward. those companies were mattel (who bought the license to monopolize the market by exclusively making 6 inch figures), figures toy co. (who bought the license to specifically make 8 inch mego-style figures using the likenesses of the batman series actors) and neca, who have an exclusive license to make figures of batman and robin literally standing at approximately 18 inches in height.as many of you know, mattel utilized a special group of contract sculptors for their popular he-man masters of the universe classics line of figures, which feature some of the best quality sculpts and designs. this team of elite sculptors is known as the four horsemen. the four horsemen are a team of specialized sculptors who work for four horsemen studios, a collectible figure design studio and manufacturer. they specialize in creating sculptures of toys and action figures. the legendary company was founded in the late 1990s as a contractor to mattel, and have since grown to an independent studio creating their own line of figures in addition to manufacturing third party designs under license.sadly, mattel did not employ the four horsemen to sculpt what i feel is the most important batman collection a company could produce. instead, mattel utilized their own sculptors. whether it was a cost-cutting measure or a simple mistake, mattel failed to deliver sculpts which captured the entire essence and realism of the 1966 batman characters. for the final product, consumers are left with cartoon-ish interpretations of real actors in costume. while these childish designs might appeal to small children or fans of mattel's wwe wrestling figure collections, most buyers and fans over the age of 12 will not be satisfied with these infantile figures.pros and conspro: the first-ever licensed 1966 batman figures we've been waiting for!con: the figures have severe quality control issues ranging from defective and weak joints to poor paint jobs.pro: batman and robin's fabric capes have wire in them which allow you to shape them for poses.con: mattel is monopolizing the market by owning exclusive rights to produce 1966 batman figures in the 6 inch scale.pro: the set includes a creative window display so you can recreate batman and robin's adventures as they climb up and down the side of the building.con: mattel uses a low-grade plastic on the figures and certain key parts differ in color.pro: the figures have suitable articulation.con: this 2-pack is currently the only way for fans to purchase the burt ward version of robin as a figure.",Negative, 0.28205128205128205,perfect pros cons controversial dedicated many special popular masters best quality team elite team work action legendary addition important simple mistake failed cartoonish real childish appeal fans fans satisfied severe quality issues defective weak poor allow creative suitable fans,Negative

"the new 1/12 scale mattel 1966 batmobile is a rolling platform for your 6 inch action figures and not much else.first the packaging: the box art has little to do with any of the graphics evident in the original tv series. it's sturdy, so sturdy you will need to literally tear the package open to get the toy out; both ends are securely glued down, not taped (i tried using a wire to slice through cleanly, but the glue is too tough), which makes no sense at all once you finally get the thing open and find there are plastic security turn-screws that release the toy from the cardboard interior base and are designed to be reused.the toy's design is nice and large and will accommodate your figures. there are even seat-belts to secure them in.but, the details are where this batmobile begins to lose luster. the fins and nearly every other protruding item are made of soft rubber. that's wonderful if you intend to beat this thing up against walls and curbs, but at over $60 plus tax retail i don't see anyone actually playing with this. i'm pretty certain the collectors interested in this version will not be actually playing with it. the unpainted black plastic that makes up the body of the toy is scratched and gouged in many places - mine right on the hood!. i brought this issue up with the r/c version: manufacturers can produce tv remotes and other plastic housed gadgets without all this mess, why not a toy? you don't see hasbro toys with this degree of defacement.finally, there is the toy's action: there is none besides wheels that spin and a steering wheel that turns. they don't pivot left to right like even the $30 die-cast 1/18 scale version does. the box art hype mentions magnets, lasers and parachutes, none of which are included with this model. if i was six years old i'd accept the mention as a cue to pretend. i'm a little too old to pretend.in short, there is nothing here that makes any sense: for a premium of between $60 and $100 you receive a toy designed for rough play whose only buyers will be older collectors. seeing as how the separately sold batman figures will surely be placed in the toy, mattel must have envisioned that it would be removed from the box and thus subject to scrutiny. under scrutiny its value and quality just doesn't hold up. i've waited since the 1970s mego batmobile held my dynamic duo, over forty years, for a scaled model designed to hold figures. here it is at last, and it's disappointing. maybe if the price was considerably less i would still be disappointed with its lack of features but satisfied i'd received my money's worth. i am a target employee and paid somewhat less than most people will - and that is where i suggest purchasing it. do not pay more than retail!",Negative, 0.23809523809523808,new action original sturdy sturdy open securely cleanly tough open security nice accommodate secure lose luster soft wonderful pretty interested scratched many right issue mess action right like hype accept pretend rough play value quality dynamic disappointing still disappointed lack satisfied worth,Negative

"i previously wrote a review criticizing the game for being violent and anti-life, but after reading the criticisms and explanations i got, i took it off.  i then went back and looked at the age limit for the game.  it says &#34;everyone 10+&#34;.  my 5-year-old and 8-year-old grandsons have been playing it, and the 5-year-old can't get enough of it.  i'm wondering why he plays the survival part, other than that he has a tremendous will to win/live and won't give up.  he can't figure out how to survive, and i think the reason is that this is an adult game.  he has always played games older than his age because he could figure them out and master them, but not this one.  this game calls for adult sophistication and adult decision making.  i think 10 is too low an age to start playing this game, at least the survival part, and there are probably some 18-year-olds who can't figure it out.also, i notice that whenever the background music comes on i instantly relax, and i'm not even playing.  i would say that it probably puts everyone in hearing distance into alpha mode.  i would think it would be better to be fully alert to be a good player, so why use a mode that puts players into a light trance?  could there be subliminals behind the music?  what's the reason?  why am i the only one questioning it?  and why haven't the creators of the game, if they are proud of their work, talked about this game in public, how it was created and what it's supposed to do?  and especially what the music is supposed to do!to me, it would be better if the creative part of this game could be a separate game for children with the survival part omitted.  when children play the survival part, it makes the world look like a dangerous place where survival is all but impossible because they don't know how to make the decisions they need to make in order to survive.  they are just too young.  i don't think being 10 years old is going to make any difference; it's still too young an age to play the survival part of this game.  in my opinion, it's way out of the league of children under 13 and maybe even 16 or older.",Negative, 0.17142857142857143,criticizing violent criticisms limit enough survival give reason master start survival instantly relax better alert good light reason proud work better creative survival play survival like dangerous survival impossible order young still young play survival,Positive

"i admit, neither my 4-year-old nor i have played any leapfrog games before this one. i played plenty of video games in my youth, and spend perhaps too much time playing games on my phone these days, so i at least am not naive to the world of gaming.a good game teaches you how to play, building up the pieces one at a time, then sets you loose. this game teaches you how to play, but builds up the pieces far too quickly.there are a couple different components of this game. there's a collect-the-widgets part, where the characters are lead through very simple mazes to collect all of the pennants. this is a pretty simple concept, but builds slowly into greater complexity - you have to avoid being seen by the bad guys, you can find bonus prizes, and so on. there are also locked doors, and to get the key you have to play a card game, like a memory game (matching cards in pairs) or a rule-out games (rule out cards based on features, like number of eyes or color of fur).here's the problem, though: the concept of lead-the-character-through-the-maze has only just been introduced when the match-the-cards-to-get-the-key part comes in. especially for younger children, this is too much, too fast. if the game taught the maze part, then had a few simple mazes to practice, then brought in the memory game, it might work. this design, with all the game modes piled on top of each other, is just confusing. in addition, new functions are taught in the middle of the game. when spitballs are introduced to blow out candles, there's not a mini-tutorial before the game. no, instead the player will be halfway through a maze, land on a spitball, and the game will stop for an explanation. this game was not designed with any sense of flow.the flow of the game breaks all the time. if the character finds one of the monster cards, it stops the maze game for a splash screen of the card, reminding the gamer to go look at their card collection some time. not now, of course, you're in the middle of a maze, so finish the maze, then... yeah.there's a subgame of building your own monster then testings its ability to scare a child. this has nothing to do with the maze/memory game, except that you need to collect the cards from the mazes to make the scary monsters.worst yet, there are bugs in the game. when you come back to a maze from the card games to get a key, sometimes the bad guys are just randomly placed instead of on their little walking tracks. sometimes the last card from the memory game tutorial stays on the board for the first run through the memory game, making it very confusing for a kid trying to learn it.would this be fine with older kids? possibly. would this work better for kids who've played a lot of leapfrog games already? probably. but i really question the assertion that this game is good for 4-year-olds. it's too busy interrupting itself in the early stages, teaching too many things at once instead of gradually building skills.it's built on the same premise as a lot of other leappad games, that constantly interrupt the child's use of the product, endlessly blurting out instructions or suggestions that distract the child from what they're trying to do - play and learn.",Negative, 0.3673469387755103,youth time naive good play time loose play lead simple pretty simple slowly bad bonus play like like problem fast simple work top confusing addition new blow flow breaks time monster time monster scare scary bugs bad randomly confusing learn fine work better good many interrupt distract play learn,Negative

"we have two of the olderleapfrog leapster 2 learning game system - greenand 11 of the various cartridge games. i can honestly say we love each and every one of them. i had high expectations for the monster's u game on the leappad, and unfortunately i am disappointed. the game has two problem areas for me.1) it is extremely repetitive. the main part of the game is a series of easy mazes with obstacles and monsters to avoid and things to collect and use. one particular level might have 3 things to teach you (tools, strategies, etc.) but not only will it make you go through ten extremely similar mazes, and you don't ever have to use any of the strategies or tools at all.2) it is not educational. the mazes are totally not challenging, even to my 3 year old. you don't need to use any of the strategies or tools the game suggests, so why bother? one of the small side games is a version of the classic gameguess who. we love guess who and play it all the time. the monster's u version takes all the thinking out of it. for example, one clue might be that the monster in question is blue. great, so your kid learns process of elimination by turning over the other colors. unfortunately the game immediately tells you to turn over the other monsters. your kid does not have to turn on their brain and think at all. just follow the instructions like a little robot. it makes me insane.i was so worried that my kindergartener's leapster 2 would be soon forgotten when our shiny new leappad 2 and monster's u game arrived, but he finds the monster's u game so boring that he sticks with his leapster and it's excellent, fun, and challenging games. it breaks my heart to give a bad review to a leapfrog product, but it seems like all the effort went into the flashy leappad and none of the effort went into the game :(-------------------------------------------editing to add that we now have two of the leappad2 and have found tons of excellent games, challenging, educational, fun for the kids, on the leapfrog website. the kids especially love the roly poly games, solar taxi, and elements on the loose. as a bonus when you download a game you can load it on up to three compatible leapfrog devices.",Negative, 0.4,learning love unfortunately disappointed problem repetitive easy teach challenging bother classic love play time monster great elimination unfortunately like worried shiny new boring excellent fun challenging breaks heart give bad like flashy add excellent challenging fun love loose bonus compatible,Negative
"i'm not entirely sure what the point of the tag / leapreader books are.  as someone who enjoys reading to his daughter, and loves watching her read on her own, i don't really see the point of a book like this.  for true interactivity, there are computers and tablets.  otherwise, get a real book.  having an electronic pen that reads out a paragraph or describes a scene feels lazy - the whole point of reading is that you engage with the material yourself, not listen to a canned voice-over of a specific scene.  for fans of monsters university, it probably won't matter, since the book does capture the spirit of the new movie.  it offers a condensed story, complete will illogical narrative jumps and definitely favors big, bright pictures over words.  sorry, but these books (and this one in particular) are not something i'd ever get again.",Negative, 0.23076923076923078,enjoys loves like real lazy whole engage fans spirit new illogical bright sorry,Negative
"i was not impressed by this product at all. it's essentially a cheap piece of plastic that does nothing other than serve as a holder for an ipad. you download the free app that can be used on its own, snap the ipad in the plastic case (that i would not trust to keep the device safe at all), and then the stamps trigger different functionality. so, one stamp will allow you to change between safari, undersea, and city themes. another one, every time you touch the screen will place a different object (based on the chosen theme) on the screen. another one makes sounds. you get the idea. with the pen, the kids can draw all over the screen. but, these are all things that can be done without the plastic case and stamps. i also found that i was constantly picking the stamps and pen up because they would fall out of the case.  i really can't come up with a need for this case at all and it's most definitely not worth forty dollars!  the app is okay on it's own, but free kids art apps are everywhere and this one isn't anything special.",Negative, 0.1875,impressed cheap serve free trust safe allow change time touch object idea fall worth free special,Positive

"i got this set for my two nephews and niece who all love to play with the wooden thomas the train set and table.  we have many accessories and buildings, which they will all play together with and have lots of fun.  while the pieces aren't cheap, they hold up well and aren't made of plastic.  one thing they do fight over sometimes is a motorized thomas the train car that runs on batteries.  they all love that one, so when i saw this set i thought it might be something that they would all love to play with.i couldn't have been more wrong!the first thing that didn't go over well was this track set is only really supposed to go together one way.  unlike the wooden sets that allow a child to build a world using their imagination, this one has to be put together exactly as shown.  i hate this as it lessens the longevity of the toy and doesn't allow the child to explore his/her creativity.the thomas isn't interchangeable with the wooden sets.  since this is fisher price the scale is different than the wooden sets.  unfortunately i didn't really check this out when i got it since most thomas the train sets can be used together despite the manufacture (including the knock off brands).it took a while to put together, and when it was put together it was fairly large.  another downside is that when you construct it some of the pieces can't be taken apart because they lock together permanently after putting together for the first time.  this is very unfortunate, since as i said it was fairly large when put together.  it's a big drawback in my opinion since this toy didn't hold their attention more than 30 min.  it isn't a toy that you will want to have out all of the time.  another drawback is that since the track has to be put together a certain way, your little one won't probably be able to do it him or herself unlike the wooden sets.finally, one of the ""features"" of this train set is that thomas is supposed to save the crown when he disappears into the tunnel.  i couldn't get the crown to stay in the hole without dropping down into the tunnel, so it ended up derailing the train.  we tried this several times and couldn't get the crown to stay up on top and then drop down into the tunnel when the train went through.bottom line.  this is a complete waste of money in my opinion.  even if your child is a big thomas fan.  the train only goes around the track in one way.  it's not interchangable.  parts of it didn't work the way it said it should, and it didn't hold their interest more than 20 min which was less time than it took to put it together.i would highly recommend the thomas the train wooden sets, buildings and accessories.  they may be expensive, but they are worth the investment.  kids love to play with those.  spend your money on that, not this.  even at hald the price i wouldn't get this again.  even if it was free i don't think i would get it again as it takes up too much space and won't fit back in the box it came in.go for the real deal and you won't be disappointed (or waste your money).thomas and friends wooden railway - talking railway stop and greet signalthomas and friends wooden railway - battery powered thomasthomas and friends wooden railway - water tower figure 8 set",Negative, 0.26666666666666666,love play many play fun cheap well love love play well allow imagination hate longevity allow unfortunately knock fairly downside time unfortunate fairly drawback time drawback able save top waste work interest time recommend expensive worth love play free space fit real disappointed waste water,Negative

"updated march 10, 2014.  original review below the line.we had some friends come over, and they decided to ride on this after being idle for a month or so.  (hey, it rains a lot in the pacnw.)  this was kept semi-exposed to the elements in part of a loafing shed.alas, kids got on it, took off at 7mph, tried turning around the corner, but the throttle pedal stuck.  there are no brakes on this thing; you slow down by lifting off the throttle.  when you're turning at 7mph, things go badly.  the kids were thrown off into mud, and the car smashed into a tree, where it still kept going.luckily the kids were safe with just some scratches, bruises, and mouthfuls of mud.i contacted peg perego:  there are no recalls on this item, but they did send a new throttle pedal and a printout of how to install it.overall, this thing is dangerous:  there needs to be some kind of spring on the outside of the pedal casing to always push the pedal back up.  even if there already is one in the casing, redundancy would've prevented our injuries.  i don't know why the pedal sticks, but i can only guess it's because of some kind of debris got into the casing itself, which is ridiculous.  a kids toy that's mean to be outside, and dirt could potentially cause injuries?  come on guys...while fun, this is obviously not safe, and i no longer recommend it.----------------------------------------------so we've all seen the little cars at big box stores that are roughly the same idea as this:  kid gets in and can ride around.  difference is, the ones that run for a couple hundred bucks in a box store generally seats one kid, goes very, very slow, doesn't hold a charge, and can barely make it through thick carpet, much less a slight incline outside.in steps peg perego.  yes, this entire thing is still mostly a large collection of plastic parts to make it look like something cooler than what it is (but really, aren't all cars, especially luxury cars the same thing?)  the differences with this go much further:  depending on how much you're really taxing it, the battery lasts quite a while - long enough (most of the time) to have the kiddo ready to do something else.  the weight limit here is 150 (total - not per kid, fatty), and while the more weight on it the quicker the battery dies, at least it's an option.the speed of this is awesome.  with the cheaper units (i suppose designed for smaller kids that maybe can't walk yet?), the top speed is basically ""very slow walking speed"" that's kind of boring.  this one, at 7mph (or if your kiddo is small, there's a governor that'll hold it to 3.5mph), is quick.  quicker than your kid (or you) are going to be walking continuously.  no, it's not an outright sprint, driving around 7mph on this for a while is much more fun than running around at 7mph until your heart is pounding and your left arm goes numb.while we're using this on some acreage and a relatively small house, if you have the opposite (big house, not much land), it may also be fun.  however, because of its speed and ability to actually go through gravel/driveway, grass, dirt, etc, i'd say it'd be much more fun than just driving from bedroom to kitchen to living room, with a couple crashes into your tiffany lamps thrown in for good measure.delivery (for me) was done via a scheduled delivery with ceva (some delivery place i had previously never heard of) that was very friendly and accommodating to my schedule - they just needed a 4-hour window on a weekday for delivery.  setup was also very easy...and kind of fun.  there are lots of plastic pieces to snap all over the place, but it leads up to the anticipation of actually driving it around...which won't be the same day as you open the box, because...if you're buying this as a gift, unless you don't really like the kid you're giving it to, open the box and charge the battery a day or two prior.  the first charge requires an 18 hour charge, lest you damage the battery - forever.  (by damage, it means that it'll never hold a ""full"" charge, so maybe you'll end up with 10 minutes of drive time, for example.)  it's all pretty easy to get back into the box, so just do it so you don't have a disappointed little guy wishing 18 hours of his life away before he can play on his new atv.all in all, a great product that for me has been performing as well as advertising (which is actually better than i expected.)  doesn't work so well in muddy or heavily saturated yards, but i didn't really think it would.  recommended.",Negative, 0.32911392405063306,original idle throttle stuck slow throttle badly still safe scratches bruises new throttle dangerous kind redundancy kind ridiculous dirt fun safe recommend idea slow yes still like luxury taxing enough time ready limit fatty quicker dies awesome cheaper top slow kind boring quicker fun heart fun dirt fun living crashes good friendly accommodating kind fun leads anticipation open gift like giving open damage damage drive time pretty easy disappointed life play new great well better work well muddy recommended,Negative

"sadly, i knew from the opening sequence that this game wasn't going to be very good.  i had high expectations that were not only not met but actually dashed to bits.  in a nutshell, this game stinks.first is the environment.  forget the lush visuals of the trailers and promos. at least 80% of the game will be spent in dark rooms, hallways, corridors, outer space, spacecraft, vent shafts and other drab environments.  second, the navigation stinks.  the navigation and objective markers are very confusing at times. and that's only when the directional objective marker actually feels like appearing (there were several times i tried to invoke it, only to get a text display of my objective and nothing more).  it can be more confusing than helpful at times, especially when it rotates 360 degrees, like when you're in outer space, zero gravity or on a multi-level structure.  and some of the mission objectives are just downright confusing.  you'll get a vague hint like ""assist so and so"" but it doesn't tell you that this assistance involves several steps that aren't very intuitive.the weapons for the most part are decent but there are major shortcomings.  for instance, the game loves to put you in rooms full of ammunition and weapons like you're in a candy store but you can only carry a ridiculously small supply. you get one primary weapon, one secondary and a max capacity refill of reach. there are two types of grenades but you can only carry one type at a time.  when you're looking at a weapon on the ground, you can see the specs for it but the lame comparison leaves a lot to be desired.  instead of orange and green bars to indicate more or less power, just do a side by side.  the worst glitch with the weapons is that some of them will simply refuse stop working and refuse to fire.  there is no explanation, no little text message to say ""too close to target"" an indication that the weapon is empty or anything.  nope, you just sit there pressing r2 like a maniac while getting riddled by the enemy.  as if ridiculous cheapness were';t enough, the ai enemies even do little victory dances over your body and take cell phone pics of their kill.  so after the game fails on you, it celebrates its failure in tacky fashion.there are adrenaline packs that you can use during battle.  they will restore your health and also give you a temporary slowed down matrix style ""bullet time"" boost.  it's helpful when facing a few enemies but pretty much useless when needed most, against scores of enemies as you'll encounter in the latter stages of the game.  like the weapons, they also seem to disappear without warning when you need them most.  i'll start a new section with a full supply of adrenaline packs but somehow go down and see the message ""no adrenaline packs available"".the tactical echo and o.w.l. were the only two things that really stood out about the game and even they had their faults.  they are usually excellent tools in your arsenal, especially for helping  deal with the darker environments.  the tactical echo acts almost like a heat sensor, displaying enemy silhouettes through walls, doors or floors.  the o.w.l. is your personal drone that is capable of providing a shield, attacking enemies, disabling enemy shields and hacking computer systems which accomplishes numerous objectives like disabling alarms, opening doors, navigating ships, disabling security systems, etc. unfortunately, when you use the most useful features like shield and pulse, it quickly drains the o.w.l. and it will end up off in a corner recharging when you really need it.  also, as far as engagement, although it occasionally kills enemies, (more in the beginning than latter stages), by the last few chapters of the game, it amounts to little more than a distraction and hacking device.  99% of the enemies will need to be dispatched by you.all in all, i played the game only because i paid for it. i can wholeheartedly say if this were offered free as a ps-plus game of the month or some other deal, i likely would have deleted it by now.  i would not buy the game again if given the chance all over again, but everyone has different tastes.  my advice is to watch a couple play through videos online just to get a grasp of the environment you'll actually be playing in versus the much prettier environments shown in the ads.  might not hurt to rent it first as well, if you're able to do so.  otherwise, grab it in a bargain bin as cheap as possible or wait to see if sony offers it as a free ps plus game (highly likely in the near future) if you simply must have it.however, if frequently getting lost in dark environments with malfunctioning weapons and vague directives while having enemies twerk over your body and take cell phone pics after a ridiculously cheap kill seems like fun, then dive on in.  this is the game for you!",Negative, 0.5051546391752579,sadly opening good lush

"man was i excited to order this thing. the pictures and product information on its page made it look very cool. unfortunately, while thenerf n-strike elite centurion blasteris intended to be a heavy-duty sniper rifle toy, what it ends up being is a giant pain-in-the-neck that doesn't work right. frankly, i am baffled how this thing made it past quality control.as i show in the video, it does fire up to 100 feet (given good wind, and angling it up at least 15 degrees, 45 or more if you really want it to go for distance) -- but that is about where the fun stops.the basic problem is that it is nearly impossible to get it to load from the clip. my brother was able to do it a couple of times after carefully positioning the clip in the unit, and cocking the toy at a certain angle. i was never able to get it to load from the clip. i always had to manually load it. (which i show how to do in the video -- you basically just slide a dart into the cocking mechanism tube inside the unit after pulling down on the loading bolt a bit).  the cocking mechanism isn't firmly aligned into place, and there isn't enough give/forgiveness at the ""mouth"" of the loading tube to continue to load a dart, if the tube catches any part of the edge of the dart. a rounded/sloped/beveled edge instead of a straight/90 degree sharp angled tube mouth would have been a much better design.so, yeah, the toy hardly works at all. you can get it to load (although i am sure loading it manually like i was doing isn't very advisable, and will cause it to break even more eventually), and you can get it to fire (at least the one i got, anyway), but like any nerf toy gun, this thing isn't very accurate at range, and with the slow rate of fire, no kid is going to want to get stuck with this toy gun when they play with their group, they'd be a sitting target.i can see the vision nerf was going for with this one, and they almost made it, but those little details ended up biting them in the end. i can't rate a toy that isn't fun to play with, is hard/impossible to use for a kid, and more or less arrives broken, with anything other than 1 star. sorry, nerf, maybe next time.1 star.",Negative, 0.303030303030303,excited order cool unfortunately elite work right baffled quality good fun problem impossible able able aligned enough sharp better yeah works like break like accurate slow stuck play biting fun play broken sorry,Negative
"i was only able to shoot the gun 25~ times before it broke.the out-of-the-box assembly is simple and requires no tools. loading and readying a shot is easy, most kids should be able handle it - very little strength is needed. firing the gun provides satisfying feedback (a pleasing and authoritative cha-chungk sound). design-wise, i wish the gun came with a scope, reticule, or something to make the aiming easier. it is a long-range model, after all. there is an iphone app available that lets you aim with the phone, but you need to buy a mount (sold separately) to attach the iphone to the gun. otherwise, the gun is just equipped with rails to aim with.when it was working, the gun was able to fire 100 feet, as advertised.  the darts make a cool whistling sound as they fly through the air. i didn't get to shoot anyone, so i can't rate how painful the darts are. i'd guess that they don't hurt very much - they have a hollow rubber tip that is squishy to the touch.after shot 20 or so, the gun began to fire darts at a dramatically shorter distance. eventually, the gun could be ""cocked"" back all the way, but would only return halfway to the forward position. apparently, the internal mechanism has some sort of jam or broken part that prevents it from being fully cocked, which now keeps the gun from firing.the directions that come with the gun only give advice for fixing a dart jam, or clearing the barrel of an obstruction - nothing about how to fix the actual firing mechanism. three people worked for an hour to try and fix this gun, but to no avail. i figure that the only way to fix it would be to take the gun apart - and even then, it might need a replacement piece.if you were to give this to a rambunctious kid, or really anybody who planned to use it outside of a delicate testing environment, it would probably break even sooner, if you can imagine that.",Negative, 0.28571428571428564,able simple easy able strength satisfying pleasing authoritative scope easier available aim aim able cool air painful hurt hollow jam broken give jam obstruction worked give delicate break,Negative

"i'm not surprised to see the general remarks already cataloged for the nerf n-strike elite centurion blaster.  and while i don't like to participate in beating the proverbial dead horse, this gun was given to me so that i could offer feedback.  and like many others, i found the product problematic in the nicest terms possible.  it's a shame, really, because this gun looks absolutely awesome.  first of all, it is enormous!  it even has a bipod stand so that you can hone your sniper skills.  also intriguing, the capability to gather additional hardware such as the nerf mission app tactical rail mount to enhance your nerf warfare experience.  using an iphone or an ipod touch, you can secure apps that allow you to record missions and have scoping functionality. listen, any kid who loves nerf would definitely want to add this to their collection upon sight.this is where i'd usually run down the features of a product and offer some sort of commentary.  but i have very little to say beyond the basics due to what appears to be a ubiquitous design flaw.  while recommended for those aged eight and up, i think this particular unit skews much older.  we don't let kids play with the toys in our household, that's a job for the adults!  my experiences, therefore, with the nerf n-strike elite centurion blaster are from a grown-up perspective.  no small or careless hands operated this machinery!the unit required minor assembly, which was intuitive and uncomplicated.  but once the gun was built and loaded, it wasn't very long before the mechanism started becoming very tricky and jamming up.  i'm not talking excessive usage, i'm talking fairly conservative play time.  with patience and fortitude, you could get the unit to unstick but the issue kept recurring.  frustrated, i simply put the gun down and did a little investigating.  that's when i discovered that i was not alone in my dilemma.  others were experiencing the exact same problem and many had completely destroyed their gun.so as they say, i simply walked away.  my blaster is not broken per se, but it is relatively inoperable.  i felt like i was spending more time tending to its idiosyncrasies than to actually using it for its intended purpose.  have lots of nerf merchandising, love nerf products.  but this one needs a trip back to the design studio.  awesome idea, clunky execution.  kgharris, 8/13.",Negative, 0.3076923076923076,surprised elite like dead like many problematic nicest shame absolutely awesome enormous intriguing capability rail enhance experience touch secure allow loves add beyond flaw recommended play elite careless intuitive uncomplicated tricky excessive fairly conservative play time patience fortitude issue frustrated dilemma problem many broken inoperable like time purpose love awesome idea clunky,Negative

"it was with great excitement that my eight year old son and i opened and assembled the nerf n-strike elite centurion blaster.  the box was huge and almost intimidating, but assembly was quick and easy.  there are a few odd assembly steps so i recommend you read the brief instructions.  the first few days of play were great.  my son lined up rows of star wars figures and could comfortably knock them down from 20 feet away.  accuracy was exceptional.  then came a jammed dart; my son had caulked the chamber forward, and in doing so, squeezed a dart halfway between the magazine feeder and the barrel.  at first, it looked like a simple problem to solve, but after 30 minutes, i gradually started having to use more and more force to dislodge the stuck dart.  ultimately we freed it, but the blaster was toast.  we could hear a few small plastic parts rattling around inside, and the normal caulking action didn't work.  so after just a few days of light-duty use, the blaster was broke.bottom line: before you purchase this blaster, carefully consider who would be using it, and whether they'd be susceptible to getting darts stuck in the barrel chamber.  nerf makes a number of solid blasters, including thenerf n-strike elite: strongarm blaster,nerf n-strike elite: rough cut 2x4 blaster, andnerf n-strike elite firestrike blaster.  for some reason, as nerf's blasters get bigger and more expensive, they get less reliable.what you need to know about this blaster:- the blaster is huge, measuring 36+ inches long - not appropriate for small areas or bedrooms- the blaster is big and heavy, not appropriate for smaller kids- it shoots darts 100+ feet, not for inside use!- it's fairly accurate, hitting a 3"" target from 20' is easy- the darts whistle as they fly through the air - very cool- the darts are durable and seem resistant to damage- the blaster is too big to run with - smaller kids will easily trip running around with this thing- if the blaster jams, it's probably permanently out of service unless you want to try disassembling 25 screws and tons of springs and small plastic partsmy recommendation for buying:- if this is for an older/taller child that's patient and able to carefully use the blaster, then the nerf n-strike elite centurion blaster is worth consideration.  if you're purchasing this for a smaller child between the ages of 8 and 11, i suspect that the blaster won't last long and therefore shouldn't be purchased.my rating:i'm rating this as two stars.  one star for fun and accuracy, and another star for value (you get a great package for the price).  but due to the lack of durability, quality, and ease of use, i'm leaving off three stars.",Negative, 0.21428571428571422,great excitement elite huge intimidating easy odd recommend play great comfortably knock accuracy exceptional like simple problem stuck freed action work susceptible stuck solid elite elite rough elite reason expensive huge appropriate appropriate fairly accurate easy air cool durable damage easily service recommendation patient able elite worth consideration suspect fun accuracy value great lack quality ease,Negative

"this seems to be an exercise in trying to look all big and bad for show while frankly being utterly impractical and almost unusable.i was never a fan of either the nerf longstrike or longshot -- the idea of big, long, bolt-action ""rifle-like"" dart guns has never made sense to me.  in a real cube war or in hvz, the action is usually more rapid and random, and the idea of someone being allowed enough time or an opportunity to play ""sharpshooter"" is just ridiculous.  however, there are modding kits out there that will let you take a longshot or longstrike and turn it into a more useable dart gun for such activities.  also, nerf offered those dart guns with shoulder stock and barrel extension attachments that were meant to be optionally attachable and removable at will -- you could use the different attachments to make either of these guns into the kind of gun you wanted, and nerf actually marketed these dart guns as having this kind of flexibility.however, the centurion is designed deliberately to be used in one and only one configuration -- fully assembled into something over 3 feet long.  in fact, nerf designed the centurion so that you can't even load the clip until the barrel extension is attached, and then, the barrel extension is meant to remain permanently attached -- this is honestly rather obnoxious!  the option should be there to use this thing with or without the extension.  unlike real guns where a longer barrel makes a bullet travel farther and straighter, a longer barrel in a foam dart gun just adds drag that slows down the dart -- so the barrel extension on the centurion is not to be regarded as a plus.that said, even if you were in a dart battle where you really had a good opportunity to play sniper, this dart gun is still just ridiculous.  the bolt-action uses an insane amount of backwards-forwards travel that just slows you down between shots -- i can't believe they really had to design it that way.  i think you'd be better off with a longshot or longstrike with one of the many mod kits out there that would improve the amount of power it can put behind each shot -- you'd end up with something of a shorter and more sensible length with a bolt action that doesn't involve a full foot of travel.in short, i can't see a real purpose for this thing other than maybe long range target practice?",Negative, 0.23529411764705885,bad utterly impractical idea real action rapid idea enough time opportunity play ridiculous useable kind kind obnoxious real drag good opportunity play still ridiculous insane better many improve power sensible action involve real purpose,Negative

"edit (moved from below):edited: after several weeks of daily use (what can i say, it's been fun), i am starting to see a major reliability issue with the cs-18. something is loose--not sure if it's electrical or mechanical in the safety mechanisms for making sure the system does not fire when unloaded. either way, it's not a good thing to pull the trigger and have nothing happen.i'm convinced at this point there is a design flaw. i'm leaving up my original review, because i had fun writing it--but i would not recommend the cs-18 unless nerf addresses the very real issue of a kid's toy not being able to work longer than about 6 weeks.original review follows:the n-strike elite rapidstrike cs-18 blaster is the latest entry from nerf arms for the battle against nerf-allergic-aleiens. while it is true that no such aliens have attacked us (yet) nor has their home planet been found (yet), i do appreciate the long running efforts to provide blasters for the battle. after all, hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, and if we leave defense planning in the hands of the pool noodle advocates, that's where we'll be.the cs-18 has several developments that will prove useful in the coming battles with the naas. first, there is the high-capacity 18 round clips. this serves useful, as the best guess is that naas will travel in groups of 6, and 3 groups make up an attack squad. the 18 round clip that is included is see-through, though that sword cuts both ways: you can see how many rounds remain, but so can the naa. it will help battlefield commanders to verify their warriors go onto the plains of battle fully loaded.second, the rapid fire development is improved over other models. fully automatic fire from the cs-18 will help with the speedy onslaught of the alien menace.third, the collapsing stock allows for concealment as well as an adjustment to fit both the ""ooh, this is awesome"" battalion of naa fighters as well as the ""dad, you're being a nerd"" battalion. this latter battalion comes through when it counts, though. the carry handle makes transport easy.fourth, surprisingly, the needed 4 c batteries do not disrupt the balance of the cs-18. the power module fits into the shape of the blaster in one of the natural grip positions, forward of the clip. this requires most entry-level warriors to keep both hands on the blaster, but his will stabilize aim in combat. those naas are coming, and we must ready.the stability of aim is one of the reasons that the cs-18 will need to be augmented with other entries from nerf arms, and i hope that they will continue to develop this area. while centering the target reticle on a location is generally going to cause one of the 18 rounds to hit it, the overall accuracy of a straight piece of foam, propelled straight out of a short barrel, with a rubberized tip, is exactly what anyone with a clue about ballistics would expect.that is not to say that the attacking hordes of naas will not be held back--rather just to warn the user that the cs-18 is more effective against group formations at range--than it is against a single target. especially if that target is somewhat shielded. this is not quite the area-suppression blaster that the hailfire system is, but also not a pinpoint accuracy device.another drawback is that, while current intelligence shows that naas cannot hear the high-pitched fan of the acceleration module, eventually the naas will be able to hear that high-pitched sound and the element of surprise will be lost. to see the results of this, simply attempt to use the cs-18 in a training scenario when the mother of the battalions has decreed it ""calm time"" and you will recognize that the noise can be disruptive.the tactical rail allows the addition of accessories, though i found adding a laser sight and flashlight made the cs-18 a bit unwieldy. that was also a greater investment than was appropriate in the face of potential user errors.eventually, one expects the spring in the detachable clip to wear out and the whole unit to need replaced--but those are available through the primary suppliers, including here at jungle-com, and include additional ammunition with the clip.in all? i recommend this as a primary infantry blaster for the coming war with the naas. the larger weapons, such as the rampage or hailfire, should be distributed among the battalions as appropriate, but each individual warrior should be equipped with a cs-18. (and a pocket back-up blaster, but that's another discussion.)edited: after several weeks of daily use (what can i say, it's been fun), i am starting to see a major reliability issue with the cs-18. something is loose--not sure if it's electrical or mechanical in the safety mechanisms for making sure the system does not fire when unloaded. either way, it's not a good thing to pull the trigger and have nothing happen.",Negative, 0.1805555555555556,moved fun major reliability issue safety good flaw original fun recommend real issue able work elite appreciate good advocates well useful useful best attack many help verify rapid improved help speedy onslaught well fit awesome well disrupt balance power stabilize aim stability aim hope centering accuracy effective accuracy drawback intelligence able lost calm time recognize noise rail addition unwieldy appropriate detachable whole available recommend rampage appropriate fun major reliability issue safety good,Positive

"my son was thrilled with this train set, and it was fairly easy to put together (with three boys i've put together many and usually go nuts each time).  the tracks stay connected with a unique locking mechanism that seems well-designed.  it took me three times to set it up to the picture's design though, as the pieces aren't obvious to place, and the instructions were not kid-friendly (like lego's instructions that a kid who doesn't read can figure out).so, put together, it looked good.  had to put it on the kitchen table though, as carpet made it too uneven to use. it took up a good half and then some of my 4' x 4' square table.here's where the problem now occurs: using it.  the push trains have to be placed very carefully to go anywhere...it's like a putt-putt thing where the kid physically has to push it all around. no problem usually, except that they have to climb all over the thing to get the trains where they need to go, which invariably knocks over a trestle or another piece and ruins it.  it's just not easy for a younger kid to maneuver around as they play.  like i said, it's not the tracks...they stay connected. it's more the size and layouts that are difficult to work around.  i think what it needed was more straight and flat pieces to give the trains time to chug along, instead of just hills that make your kid have to practically climb on top of it to push them down the hill.  which, actually happened.  caught my son standing on the kitchen table trying to push the cars down the hill as it was too high to do it standing next to the table.i hope this makes sense.  i don't find it that educational or fun, but it is sturdy and will last forever.the final blow was after that first day, and despite my offering for him to take over the kitchen floor and build it again, he put it in a box and just kept the trains to go play with his other toys.  it's collecting dust.",Negative, 0.2333333333333333,thrilled fairly easy many time connected unique like good uneven good problem like problem ruins easy play like connected difficult work give time top hope fun sturdy blow play dust,Negative

"a couple clarifications before i evaluate the game: i enjoy many game types, but i like cooperative because i can involve my kids (11, 9, 7 at time of this review). my kids love forbidden island (fi). they can struggle, work together, and win. they bought me forbidden desert (fd) for my birthday because they thought they'd like playing it with me.they (and i) were disappointed. it is significantly more difficult, meaning that while they may often win in fi, they more often lose in fd. the game mechanic is the same: you lay tiles (randomly) to create a playing board. this creates a different board each game (like settlers of catan or carcassone). this adds to the replay-ability. in fi, you'd have the chance a tile would become submerged, and if not acted upon, perhaps would disappear. this meant that often, you'd have a chance to go do something before that happened. that was really the only &#34;time&#34; aspect to that game.with fd, you have two or three timing elements, making it much more difficult. the first is that instead of fi's 2 states of any given land tile (submerged or not-submerged; i guess &#34;gone&#34; could be a third state), fd has many - you add &#34;sand dune&#34; tiles on top of the land. meaning that instead of only having to address a flipped/submerged tile once to clear it (in fi), with fd, you may have to spend many turns clearing a single tile from the many dunes on it.the second timing element is that you have a limited water ration and you can't really replenish it. sure, there is an annoying card combo (/if/ someone has a water carrier role, and /if/ that person goes to the well when it is uncovered, and /if/ that person can get to another person), you can provide water to someone else. otherwise, you will have party members dying from exposure within a few cycles through the deck.finally, the third way you can lose is that if all the sand dune tiles are used up, the game ends. so even if you are diligent in removing dunes, if you aren't fast enough, you can lose that way!i have only played this a few times with my kids, but we have managed to lose each way without having won yet. for a grown-up group, i believe we could win, but i generally don't play co-operative games with other adults (more into competitive games, then), so this doesn't apply.sorry, but this game doesn't do it for me. i'm actually sad because i wanted to like it but it gets no love in my house. we'd rather play village, kingdom builder, or even forbidden island instead.",Negative, 0.3269230769230769,enjoy many like cooperative involve time love forbidden struggle work win forbidden desert like disappointed difficult meaning win lose randomly create like difficult many add top meaning clear many many limited water annoying water well water dying lose diligent fast enough lose lose win play cooperative competitive sad like love play forbidden,Negative

"this is a well designed toy that my son was very excited to get since he is working on multiplication facts and was very enthusiastic about having a toy help him to do so.first things first, he turned off the volume after about 5 minutes of playing with it. the music in the background is horribly annoying and tinny - even to an 8 year old who enjoys noise! i offered earphones and got a 'you must be crazy' look for that. the voice that narrates the instructions and gives feedback is a high pitched extra enthusiastic voice that would fit better with toddler toys. upon asking the child why he didn't want the volume on i was informed that it sounded like a baby toy and was embarrassing. ok then.so, volume off, he continued playing with it with waning enthusiasm over the next few days. yup, it has some cute games - skip counting, speed multiplication, missing factors, sequencing multiples and finding factors for a number. all well and good but the flashing lights and annoying music were just a bit too much. to cap it all off, the center top button stopped working so that is the end of that.i think the creators of the toy misstepped by making a babyish toy for material that is meant for kids who are trying very hard to not be associated with anything remotely babyish. besides that, many toys have the option of turning off the music and leaving the voice on. this one does not. the headphone jack is a nice touch if the child is willing to listen to the racket.unfortunately, i think multiplication facts and many other mathematical concepts are better learned and taught by apps on your phone or tablet. for a child with access to apps, this toy is a disappointment.",Negative, 0.26666666666666666,well excited enthusiastic help annoying enjoys noise crazy extra enthusiastic fit better like embarrassing ok waning enthusiasm cute well good annoying top hard many nice touch willing many better disappointment,Negative

"after playing with this microscope for a couple of hours, i concluded that the company spent more effort on designing the eye-catching box and graphics than in designing a usable microscope. there are several problems that make this toy too frustrating to really be useful. the first is that all the microscope ""movement"" pieces are plastic, and so the focus mechanism is extremely poor . . . so poor it makes the toy almost unusable.to test the device, i got a cucumber leaf from the garden that has spider mites. i found at 30 power it was extremely frustrating trying to get a view of one of the many mites on the leaf. the focus mechanism is very crude, and has many ""stick and jump"" spots, making smooth focus impossible. even worse, when you try and adjust the focus, it causes the platen to move laterally, causing you to ""lose"" the item you were trying to focus on.if you are familiar with microscopy, you will know that it can be a challenge to get the item you are interested in into the field of view. if touching the focus knob causes the field of view to ""jump"" over a millimeter or so, getting a point of interest in the field of view and in focus becomes almost impossible. with some work, i was able to get a spider mite and spider mite egg into view and in focus at 30x magnification. at 30x the image clarity was marginally acceptable. the microscope needs a brighter light, as even at 30x the image is fairly dim and low contrast.i found it virtually impossible to use at 100x. it was simply too frustrating trying to get the mite into the field of view and in focus. also, the image at this magnification was quiet dim.i am all for educational toys, and especially for getting girls interested in stem. however, i fear that this toy is so cheaply made it would have the opposite effect.perhaps it is just not possible to build a marginally functional microscope at this price range. in any event, i would suggest spending a little more and getting a unit that has some degree of precision in the focus.in addition, i would suggest that there are some excellent digital microscopes for not too much more money than this. a digital microscope plugged into a computer opens a wide range of interesting, fun, and educational possibilities.i wanted to like this toy, but unfortunately, i can not recommend it.",Negative, 0.3333333333333333,eyecatching usable problems frustrating useful movement focus poor poor power frustrating many focus crude many smooth focus impossible worse focus lose focus challenge interested focus interest focus impossible work able focus clarity marginally acceptable brighter light fairly dim impossible frustrating focus quiet interested fear cheaply marginally precision addition excellent interesting fun like unfortunately recommend,Negative

"i hate writing a bad review for a transformers toy (unfortunately something that's become increasingly common), especially for one i anticipated as eagerly as this one, but he is an absolute failure as a toy. most of him seems good, great even, visually he's a delightful updating of the original depiction, incorporating new engineering, better materials and more appreciable design flourishes, but he has a very few aspects that just went mind-bogglingly wrong. his transformation isn't inherently difficult and it doesn't look terrible, but his feet absolutely lack any forethought - in tank and jet mode they stick out awkwardly, get inthe way and are difficult to position correctly (annoying since they're incorporated in his jet mode) and in robot mode they just look extremely silly and ineffective (though they do manage to hold him up quite easily).the next problem is his head/nose cone. for some reason they used a thick, bendy rubber for the part that folds back to reveal the head. i understand that it was necessary for it to bend under the catch to hold it out in vehicle form, but it's so frustrating and disappointing (when it is ""up,"" you can see the cracks when his head forces the nose up and buldges where it's holding it in), they needed to scrap it and use a different mechanic - no reason it couldn't have been a slight alteration to the nose cone they used for classics starscream, but it it isn't. on top of this, they tried to allow the canopy to the cockpit to open when in jet mode, which would normally be a delightful touch, only it gets in the way of the clasp mechanism holding the rubber nose and cannot open to a remotely functional position (and consequently gets in the way while transforming). his head, aside from being a super gaudy yellow, has a spring mechanism, likely in an attempt to make it pop up while transforming in a ""cool"" way, which would have been awesome if it had worked, but, as it is, when you push the head down to flip the nose cone up (something that requires considerable force since the hinge of the nose cone is a thick, bendy rubber)nothing really holds it down and it pops up after a few seconds (longer than it takes to flip the nose cone up, creating great frustration in that aspect of the process -and- pushing the nose cone up when locked in place, creating an unseemly yellow crack where it should be smooth purple - a huge pet-peeve of mine, transformation joints need to fit against each other smoothly or it ruins the illusion). they should have scrapped the spring mechanic and just incorporated a manual lever to push the head up and down.even his hands have difficulty holding the weapons (which don't have much of a place to go in vehicle mode - the gun can hide a bit or even look like part of it, but the sword sticks out like a sore thumb), the bulk of his wrists requires you to position the weapons at an angle if you want the peg (which could easily be longer) to fit the hole. the sword gets away with looking alright, but the gun just looks like he's fumbling around with it. he, gratefully, has a missile shooting mechanism in his tank turret (not a light up or spinny gimmick, i've always preferred spring missiles) and normally i wouldn't complain, but given that -something- needed to go right i will point out that you get 0 lift with the missile, it just kind of slides out of the turret and flops on the ground, usually not even clearing his front end - the firing mechanism is a cute gimmick though, instead of a button or switch you pull back on the turret giving the illusion of recoil. lastly, but worst of all, are his arms in robot mode. the connecting pegs to hold his arm joints to the body do not work what so ever, they end up just resting on top of/next to his chest and given that it requires a great deal of force to move any of the joints in his arms, they just rise up out of place every time you try to move it. i almost cried when i discovered this. it's due to the complicated engineering of the tank turret, to allow it to turn side to side in tank mode, it just got too complicated carrying that over into robot mode and it practically falls apart (i can even see many arms snapping off, the joint is just way too snug and there's so little mass where his shoulder connects to his chest that the plastic could easily break if you weren't careful). he would have been brilliant if it weren't for this, i could forgive the stupid feet, i could forgive the cheap nose-cone, but there's 0 chance of having an enjoyable experience moving his arms. he looks so great, pays a wonderful homage to the original design from the 80's while updating it to be a better, more detailed, more durable form but it all falls apart when you want to move his arms. i loved this character and jumped out of my seat when i saw a preview of him, at last, an honest attempt at a functional triple changer that doesn't lack in detail, and one of the cooler triple changers to boot!

"before i begin, i fully expect any and all dealers to mark this post as ""unhelpful"" because i am going to tell you all the truth about this figure; and the truth is blitzwing is not a very good toy. blitzwing is a triple changer, meaning he has three different alt modes - a robot, a tank, and a jet fighter. trying to cram these features into one figure has always been a challenge for hasbro, going all the way back to the classic g1 days, and unfortunately this figure shows the struggle the design team had.the robot mode looks very nice, but the shoulders are constantly an issue as they have this weird double hinge to make the transformation feature work. the pegs used to keep them in place is way too small, and as a result? every time you go to move his arms, they pop out of position and it looks horrible. the way you can change faces by flipping them underneath the helmet is very cool, but that alone doesn't save the robot mode from being problematic.the jet fighter mode is reminiscent of jetfire, but again, the pegs are too small to keep everything in place and once you try to handle it? things start coming out of place and ruining the look of the toy.the tank mode is probably the best of the three modes, but it pales in comparison to warpath (who had a great tank mode) or even galvatron (who had a so-so tank mode).the transformation is not too difficult, but may be an issue for some due to the instructions lacking detail. finally? as i stated with my springer review, this figure is way over-priced. if you can find it at retail, it goes for $22.99 - almost twice what the asking price is on here. in all honesty, i can only recommend this figure to hard-core transformer fans and even then, he's best left on the shelf as a display piece. i wanted to like this figure, but couldn't. disappointing.",Negative, 0.4250000000000001,unhelpful truth truth good meaning tank challenge classic unfortunately struggle team nice issue weird transformation work time horrible change cool save start ruining tank best pales great tank tank transformation difficult issue lacking overpriced honesty recommend fans best like disappointing,Negative

"i dunno, how many years have they been making these robotic elmo toys now? the first tickle me elmo was a hit because it was a novelty item (and at a time when kids were not glued to smartphones and tablets 24/7 and actually enjoyed life as live persons). in the years since i've bought or received 3 or 4 of them and it seems they never figured out how to improve the toy.like all fisher-price toys, this one was tied down with a lot of ties and tape so it was a super-pain to remove the toy from packaging, especially when an eager 4-year-old was waiting on the sideline. the toy requires 4 aa batteries which are *not* included, so i had to hunt those down in my tool boxes. opening the battery apartment is a super pain in the you-know-what... definitely the worst implementation of all these mechanized elmo toys over the years. the compartment door is laid in such a way that it's ridiculously hard to open. i started hating this toy before elmo even gave me his first hug.we finally got the batteries installed. the switch can be turned on to play or sleep; in the latter mode, elmo sings a lullaby and falls asleep. the play mode is the one where he gives you hugs. the hug mechanism is triggered when his chest is pressed, such as when a child hugs elmo. annoyingly, the motors and gears inside elmo make tons of noise when he moves, and the way he moves his arms really creeps my 4-year-old and myself out. i highly recommend you not give this toy to your younglings on a rainy night...so this elmo tries to talk funny and also sings. luckily he doesn't laugh hysterically as much as he used to. the motor noise still overwhelms the talking and singing volume much of the time, so it's still difficult to hear what he says or sings as in the past.  another creepy thing is, in play mode when you lay him down flat on his back (don't try laying him on his stomach!), he's supposed to sing and then go to sleep, but he'll hold his arms out in a weird way, like he's trying to grab your kid and run or something.btw this toy is quite small and the whole constructions feels cheap.",Negative, 0.40909090909090895,many tickle novelty time enjoyed life live improve eager opening super pain worst ridiculously hard open hating play sleep falls play hug annoyingly noise creeps recommend give funny laugh hysterically noise still overwhelms time still difficult creepy play sleep hell weird like whole cheap,Negative

"i'm a bit confused about the age limit on this product - and the stern warnings to stick to it.  the warnings would practically have you believe that any child under eight who so much as looks as this product is in imminent danger of spontaneous combustion or something.  but having looked through the activities, i'm hard-pressed to find anything terribly dangerous or very much different than the science kits i've been doing with my older daughter since she was five (she's now seven) and now with my younger daughter is who almost five.  in fact, i'm doubtful that children much older than eight would find this kit terribly entertaining.there is an interesting variety of activities in this kit, which run the gamut from intriguing to rather lame.  the first activity, for instance, involves collecting samples from the ""crime scene"" into collection bags.  except that there is no crime scene.  we don't even know what the crime was or what we're looking for.  i guess kids are just supposed to use their imaginations and make something up, which is all well and good, but it's rather confusing the way it's presented.  so basically you just end up using tweezers to put bits of carpet fiber or other debris into small baggies.other activities involve looking at prints and tracks - fingerprints, bicycle tracks, footprints, imprints of keys, etc.  some of these activities could be interesting and educational for kids.  my older daughter enjoyed only two activities we have done, the footprint mold (but there was barely enough plaster to fill the mold even very thinly) and the key mold (again, hardly enough dough in the kit to make a good impression).one activity involves opening cans of dog food in different areas under different weather circumstances and looking for fly larva.  you'll want to do this one outside.  on the other end of the messy spectrum, one activity involves looking at a card with a ""before"" and ""after"" picture of a crime scene in order to note the differences and choose the right suspect.the most intriguing activity deals with isolating dna, but it's also the most involved activity.  it requires ""methylated spirit"" (the one component that would have been very helpful to have provided is, of course, not provided) as well as a number of household items and several complicated steps.my biggest complaint with this kit is how little it contains.  you could do most of the activities with common household items and a trip to the hardware store.  the items which are provided are largely inadequate and/or flimsy (which is quite disappointing, as durability is usually one of ravensburger's hallmarks).  it's handy to have all the activities assembled in one kit, but it might have been better had they expanded the instruction book into a longer and more free-standing book, since most of the other materials in the kit are easily obtainable.  as it stands, i really can't recommend this kit.",Negative, 0.4255319148936169,confused limit stern danger spontaneous terribly dangerous doubtful terribly interesting variety intriguing lame crime crime crime well good confusing involve interesting enjoyed enough enough good opening food messy crime order right intriguing involved spirit helpful well complicated complaint inadequate flimsy disappointing hallmarks handy better easily obtainable recommend,Negative

"before i go any further, i've uploaded several pictures of the set which will do more to review this product than anything i can write, but here are the basic outlines...when you first look at this set, the notion of a grocery store with 100 different items sounds like a dream (once you stock the shelves, of course). in some ways, it is, if you're training your 3 y.o. for a future career as a grocery store stocking boy/girl. this set has it all, from milk cartons, to canned food, to pretzels, to fruit, along with the shelves and bins to stock. of course, that's where the trouble begins. if you buy this toy for at least the younger audience (i.e. 3-4 years olds), prepare to spend a lot of your time stocking the shelves, since the items are small enough and require enough precision in placement that a younger kid is going to have a tough time. if your idea of a good time is spending 10-15 minutes every ""shopping trip"" putting item on the shelves for your child to spend 10-15 seconds taking them off, then get this. now. but wait, there's more! you might think that a product with 100 life-like grocery items would come with the labels already applied. that bottle of syrup? why, wouldn't it make sense for a manufacturer with access to machinery that can perform thousands of repetitive-but-high-precision acts a minute to use that machinery to pre-apply all the neat labels to the items? you might think it would, but alas, the manufacturer of this set thinks differently (then again, it's made in china, so maybe they don't have the machinery, just hundreds of poor workers who can only apply stickers so fast). instead of getting 100 pre-labeled items, you get 100 generic items with 100 stickers the size of your fingernail to apply. those cereal boxes that go on the shelf? think they're little plastic boxes with stickers? nope! they're cardboard punch-outs the size of stamps that you get to fold like origami to make for little shopper hands to immediately crush. but perhaps you're the type of parent who enjoys spending hours applying micro-stickers to micro-plastic grocery items, and then setting them on micro shelves. if so, this set is for you, but you better check with your vacuum cleaner first, because half of these are gone the first time you run it through your kid's room.in short, if you are a family of chipmunks (or absolutely must add a grocery store for a family of chipmunks to your collection), this set if for you. if you are human, and have any sort of time constraints, it is not. it's sad too, because had this come from the factory pre-labelled, it might have been the coolest thing ever. but insofar as the manufacturer would rather *i* pay *them* $70 to apply my own labels than pay their own factory workers to do it, i really have to knock this way down. at first, i was going to say i couldn't in good conscience take off 3 stars for this, but then i realized the set costs $70. at $30, i think it might be worth the labor on my end. at $70, it's laughable to get a box with two sheets of stickers and two sheets of origami cereal boxes.ps just in case the manufacturer is reading this, apply the labels and assemble the cereal boxes at the factory, and you've got a 5-star set on your hands.",Negative, 0.17142857142857143,like dream future food trouble time enough enough precision tough time idea good time neat poor fast like crush enjoys better cleaner time family absolutely add family human time sad coolest knock good worth laughable,Positive

"bejeweled: 2-4 players, ages 8+, average play time = 15-30 minutesfirstly, i must commend the game for having some pretty eye-catching components, namely the gems.  in all honesty however, that's where my accolades end as far as the components are concerned.  the box, in my opinion, is poorly shaped and made.  my game did not come with a bag as the manual suggests.  the gems and chips came in non-zip baggies that did not function well at all as storage devices.  i opted to use a large zip baggie for the gems and a small zip baggie for the chips.  the game is certainly pretty enough, but the quality of the components and storage devices leave much to be desired.setting up the game can be problematic, as you'll have to ensure there are matches available from the get go in order for play to go smoothly.  gameplay is a bit more streamlined, but can be a bit random.  since players are pushing gems away from them to fill slots, it can be hard to predict how the board may end up by the time your turn rolls around again.  when i play match-3 games on the pc, i at least have some control over the board and can set up chains appropriately.  the rules themselves could use more work and be a bit clearer, especially when players can't make a match.  for example, i personally don't think it's fair to replace the four center gems randomly and then not be able to move to make a match, if one existed.  luckily, we had the ability to play how we wanted since the game seemed flexible enough to allow it.overall, i could only really recommend bejeweled to families who like casual games.  it's hard to develop any sort of strategy in this game as you never know what your opponents will do on their turn.  i liked how flashy the pieces were, but disliked the way they were packaged.  it's almost like the developers put all of their money into making the gems look good but ran out when it came time to produce everything else.  the lack of a bag in my copy rubbed me the wrong way.  to sum this up, bejeweled isn't bad, but i've seen better.  the game came with an exclusive download code for bejeweled 3 on the pc which was worth $19.99 on pop cap's site, so i suppose the purchase was worth it in a round-about way.  on the other hand, the code itself is good for one download only and expires 12/31/13.  really?  one download?  try harder pop cap...",Negative, 0.18867924528301885,play time commend pretty eyecatching gems honesty accolades concerned poorly gems well gems pretty enough quality problematic available order play smoothly streamlined gems hard time play work clearer fair gems randomly able play flexible enough allow recommend like hard liked flashy disliked like gems good time lack wrong bad better worth worth good,Positive

"i actually never give this less rating for any lego product. but i had no choice. the reason for my disappointment with this set can be expressed in one word....""speedorz"".first, i'll start with the good things in this set. you get the laval, prince of lion tribe and cragger, prince of crocodile tribe minifigures. both are the two most important characters in chima story. the two minifigs are, needless to say, awesome! the best thing about the chima theme is the minifigures.this set contains some decent set-pieces. the lion's mouth-kind-of-arch is very well designed and looks nice. one small chi tower is cool.now coming to the thing i despise the most about this set..speedorz. the main problem with these speedorz is that they wobble , most of the time, while moving. the reason for that, i'm guessing, is because of a design-flaw. the front wheel is bit heavy and the back portion of the speedor is very light. hence the wobble. sometimes, adding an attachment to the back does help, but sometimes it doesn't.i had a tough time trying to make the speedor move in the way shown on the back of the box and as mentioned in the instruction manual. also, whenever the speedor used to go up the ramp, it used to land upside-down! so more chances of damage to the minifig there.what lego should have done , is that, apart from the big wheel in the front, there should have been two small wheels in the back, for balance and stability. then the speedor would have moved very nicely. i personally feel that if lego doesn't change the design of the speedors soon, people might reduce buying it. from what i've seen on the internet, not many are very happy with the speedorz.so, if you are a die-hard fan of lego, who wants to buy everything and anything and lego, then please go and buy this. else, you can happily exclude this set from your shopping list. in case you want the minifigs, you can get them in other chima sets. laval comes in ""laval's royal fighter"" and cragger in ""cragger's command ship"". those sets are expensive than this one but they are definitely worth the money!",Negative, 0.21621621621621623,give choice reason disappointment start good important needless awesome best decent well nice chi despise problem wobble time moving reason light wobble help tough time damage balance stability moved nicely change many happy please happily expensive worth,Negative

"i have been hoping that nerf would introduce a dart gun like this -- a compact non-bullpup configuration of flywheel-based dart gun.  i really wanted to like this thing!first the good things...--comfortable to hold, balanced well enough that you don't immediately develop wrist fatigue holding it.--feels solidly built -- no creaking sounds when holding or firing it.--the motor spins up quickly enough that you can realistically fire a dart after only a short delay to rev up the flywheels.--the rear part is compatible with stocks from various other nerf dart guns, which provides a bit of flexibility.now the bad things -- oh, so many...--frequent jamming, in the sense that the main trigger sometimes cannot be pulled to fire a dart, even when there is a full clip of darts in place -- after testing all sorts of combinations of old and new darts with both old and new ammo clips and ammo drums, i can honestly say that it does not matter whether you use old or new darts, and it does not matter whether you use old or new clips/drums (i even had a jam with its own 6-dart clip and the 6 darts that came with in the box in place) -- this thing just loves to jam up more than any other dart gun i've ever tried.--speaking of jamming, the jam door looks tantalizingly like it provides good access to where the darts are taken off the top of a clip and pushed into the location of the flywheels, but when you open the nice big jam door, you find an all-too-narrow opening underneath it -- it is actually the most constricted access for clearing jams i've ever seen on a nerf dart gun -- why?--nerf clearly intended the front part of this dart gun to be compatible with the various barrel extensions that have been offered on other nerf dart guns, but i can confirm that the barrel extensions from the retaliator and the recon both wobble in place after being attached -- this simply shouldn't happen, given that nerf is the designer and manufacturer of all of these different parts -- the pieces should fit solidly together.--the clip-release button is in an awkward place facing towards the trigger grip and it doesn't fully release the clips when used -- the stampede and alpha trooper have very nice and easily-used slide-controls on each side to allow operation with a finger of the trigger hand while that hand is still on the trigger grip, and the clip smoothly falls out when released -- on this dart gun, the clips stay stuck in place such that they need to be pulled out, and operation with a finger of a trigger hand still holding the trigger grip requires an awkward-feeling outward push of a finger of the trigger hand.then there's a pet peeve i have about all of the flywheel-based foam dart guns i've ever tried...  why can't nerf or anyone else offer a flywheel-based dart gun with quiet motors -- is it really necessary for these things to be so loud?  i presume it's a cost issue -- louder motors cost less than quieter ones.  however, i would actually be willing to pay considerably more to have a flywheel-based dart gun that was actually quiet when revving -- and i don't think i'm alone!so far, it appears that modding this dart gun is the only way to solve the jamming problem -- but it shouldn't be necessary to do such things!this could have been the ""end-all"" of clip-type flywheel-based dart guns, but the annoyances are all too many.  if you want an ""elite"" series flywheel-based dart gun, i highly recommend the new ""elite"" version of the rayven (which was released pretty much side-by-side with the stryfe).  i've almost never had a jam on either the old all-green version of the rayven or the new blue-and-white ""elite"" version.",Negative, 0.3278688524590164,like compact like good balanced well enough fatigue creaking enough delay compatible bad new new new new jam loves jam jam tantalizingly like good top open nice jam opening clearly compatible wobble fit awkward stampede nice allow still smoothly falls stuck still peeve quiet loud issue louder quieter willing quiet problem annoyances many elite recommend new elite pretty jam new elite,Negative

"looking at the box, i thought this would be a fun set to build awesome robots to play with. upon opening the box, my opinion quickly changed. whoever created this, was slightly insane, i think.the pieces are made of foam. they are in sheets and you pop all of the pieces out. there are a bzillion pieces that need popped out and some are soooo tiny. when i say tiny, i mean only a few millimeters  - there are some tiny little ones that are just barely 2 millimeters wide and about 4 millimeters long. some are tiny flat pieces and some are little cylinder shaped pieces and yes, they are meant to be used in building the robots and adding to the gun.i would never buy this for a 4 year old, although the age range on the box states that as the youngest of the age range. it is much too overwhelming. 8 & 10 year old nephews totally gave up on it quickly as well. it takes forever to pop out all of the pieces, for one thing. luckily that is a once and done deal. assembly takes just as long and is not very fun to do.it seems to take a million pieces just to make one figure and it ends up not being sturdy enough to play with anyway. my 15 year old daughter actually joined in and finished assembling all 3 figures as per the box and instructions. she did it mainly because she tends to be a very determined individual and she was enjoying the ridiculousness for some odd reason.to make the eyeballs, you have to insert tiny black rivets into the white balls. the joints (red) and eyeballs (white) are fairly small. smaller than the smaller sized gumballs.i thought this set would be more like construx type playsets  - a little more sturdy, with easy to handle & assemble pieces. this is nothing like that at all. i appreciate the fact that the pieces are soft. i don't even know how many times i've stepped on a lego and cursed under my breath, so the soft pieces are a nice alternative in general, but the plethora of pieces and especially the itty bitty pieces is just too much. if it was slightly more sturdy and allowed for playing with the figures after assembly, i would rate this set much higher. the colors are bright and fun, and the idea of the types of figures are great - robot, space gun, etc - but the set as a whole just does not come through and could not hold any of 3 boys' attention long enough to complete a figure. all 3 boys were in the recommended age group and none of them seemed to be impressed with the set at all. once my daughter did finish the figures, the boys thought they looked cool, but were disappointed that they couldn't really play with them because pieces would pop off and fall off.",Negative, 0.15384615384615383,fun awesome play opening insane yes overwhelming well fun sturdy enough play enjoying odd fairly like sturdy easy like appreciate soft many cursed soft nice sturdy bright fun idea great space whole enough recommended impressed cool disappointed play fall,Positive

"i bought this item for my son so that he could better enjoy our extended wooden railway system. before this, all his trains were manual operated wooden ones, including several from the thomas and friends team. however as soon as opening the pack, the disappointment started and now i have to return it back after a day of experiencing it.however before listing my complaints, i have to say that it is a good replica of  thomas, a good quality craftsmanship exist in the way it was built and paint. yet, i believe that it is the only plus on this item's side.what concerned me first was that it was pretty heavy for a toy. it weighs 5.40 ounces without battery and 6.18 ounces with the battery included. the wooden no-battery thomas, we have, is 1.95 ounces which is less than 1/3 of this one this one is pretty dense due to its metal construction and this is the main reason behind the weight difference since the dimensions of the wooden one are only a little smaller than the metal one (this one).its heavy weight is a disadvantage in its motion capacity. it can not move fast and struggles in most parts of the track even totally stopping at most places. so it never offers a smooth ride for the child (tried with two different fully charged batteries). moreover an item this heavy and dense which also has non-rounded edges (due to the original shape of the train) is pretty dangerous for a toddler to play on its own. imagine one child hitting a playmate with this toy, or throwing it to wall or glass, all sorts of nasty things can happen therefore, despite its good material quality, i would prefer a cheaper but safer construction for peace of mind.another disadvantage is how the wheels work. they do not grab the track well can not make smooth turns and struggle to keep the train on track. the front and the back wheels are battery powered and there is no way they move without the battery, so this toy can not be used as a manually operated one without the battery. i would keep it no matter what if there was a possibility to play it manually but as it is it only fits to a museum for demonstration purposes.for the $14 price tag and the fisher price brand name backing this product, i surely expected a better performing toy but thanks to amazon there is always a second option which is sending this back straight away...",Negative, 0.3055555555555556,better enjoy team opening disappointment complaints good good quality concerned pretty pretty dense reason disadvantage fast struggles smooth dense original pretty dangerous play nasty good quality prefer cheaper peace disadvantage work well smooth struggle play better,Negative
"my two year old was given a battery operated james as a hand me down from a friend, and loved it so much that we thought a battery operated thomas would be a good addition to our train table.  unfortunately, they must have changed the design of these trains.  with james, you can turn him on and he runs by himself, but when he's turned off, you can drive him around the track like the non-battery operated trains.  what's not to like?  with this thomas, if he's not turned on, his wheels are locked, making it useless.  for the amount of money you pay for one of these little trains, i would hope that it works with or without batteries, and am very disappointed in this purchase.  we will not be buying any more fisher price trains for our thomas collection.update jan 2013:  this train continues to disappoint.  the battery life is unbelievably short, lasting only a day sometimes. and even when the battery is replaced, it has such a weak motor so it can barely pull any trains along.  it struggles to even make it up hills by itself, and we have the compatible thomas tracks.  20 dollars for a train that occasionally works? no thank you.",Negative, 0.35,friend loved good addition unfortunately drive like like useless hope works disappointed disappoint life unbelievably weak struggles compatible works thank,Negative

"this is a good concept, a baby doll that you can bathe in their very own little bathtub. i was excited to give this to my daughter when our new baby was born so she could have her own dolly to bathe while i bathe our baby. but now that we have played with this doll, it seems like this toy wasn't really thought through very well.the main problem i have with this doll is that it fills up with water, and is very hard to empty out. the way i see it, at best this will get water all over your house as your toddler carries it everywhere, and at worst it will get all moldy and yucky inside from always being wet.first, the good things:the doll is cute. it has cute (very) blonde hair. it maybe looks like dolly has a little makeup on, but it is cute.the bathtub is fun with the squirting feature.the purple ""stain"" on the baby comes off with warm water or heat from your hand - kind of fun.now the negative:there is a big hole in the baby's back (as well as in the back of the towel) where baby was attached to the packaging. now i think that is just ridiculous to compromise the toy itself to make it easier to package. maybe they put the hole in there to help drain water out of the doll? you have to wonder if much water would get in the toy without the hole.the fact that this doll fills up with water (and is very hard to empty out) is really my main complaint, but it is a big enough one to merit giving this toy two stars.my kids play with this doll and bathtub in the tub when they take their bath, and that is fine. i just don't want that doll being dragged around my house getting everything wet.",Negative, 0.24324324324324326,good excited give new like problem water hard best water worst good cute cute like fun stain warm water kind well ridiculous easier help drain water wonder water water hard complaint enough merit giving play fine dragged,Negative

"after playing zombicide andzombicide season 2: prison outbreaka few times, i'm sorry to say i have to give it two stars (which on amazon means ""i don't like it"" very much).there is no doubt that the minis are awesome, and the fact that it is co-op is a major plus. i also liked this zombie mechanic better than the last night on earth zombie mechanic (i.e., zombicide zombies are dumb and move/attack using a predetermined algorithm, where as lnoe zombies seemed pretty resourceful and strategic given all the cards they can play to mess with the survivors).unfortunately, there were many things i also disliked. for example:(1) the targeting priority system does not make any sense to me. it is crazy that you have to attack other survivors first -- especially without a save. and, why would i attack the lowest threat zombie when there is a higher threat zombie standing right next to it? i wouldn't, but the game makes me!(2) it is very easy to run out of zombies, which gives those zombies you run out of an extra activation (an effect that is cumulative, and makes the game harder still). i have yet to play a game where we don't run out of one or more types of zombies on a regular basis.(3) some of the zombies are very hard or nearly impossible to kill. in fact, just about the only way to kill the abominations is with a molotov cocktail (of which there are only 2, and they are very hard to make as you have to find a glass bottle and gas card first, and make sure the same person has both of these cards).(4) survivors die way to easily. lots of people house rule this, but i would very much have preferred the survivors to have a fighting chance to begin with. and, there are not lots of ways heal in this version (so, once you take a wound it's hard to get rid of it... which is pretty bad since you only need two wounds to die).(5) the game is very random and requires very little skill (in fact, most of the decisions are very obvious). the zombies you draw are random, the equipment cards you draw are random (which is problematic since many of them are also useless), and while the zombies always hit, survivors must roll a d6 to see if they hit. and, as mentioned above, you cannot always chose what zombie you attack and are sometimes forced to attack a survivor before a zombie.on the one hand all this means it really has a chaotic zombie apocalypse feel to it (we all know the odds are against you in a zombie apocalypse). and, given that the game is so popular in general, the above issues are obviously not a big problem to many (and i mean no disrespect to those who love the game by saying any of this). on the other hand they made the game a bit boring since it doesn't involve much strategy and there is not much you can do besides search for better items that increases your chance of successful attack vs. a zombie you may not want to attack anyway. in short, the game just sort of happens to you and there isn't much you can do about it except try (and often fail) to hold out as long as possible. which wasn't very appealing to me.",Negative, 0.5972222222222222,prison sorry give like doubt awesome major liked zombie better zombie dumb pretty resourceful play mess many disliked crazy attack save attack threat zombie threat zombie right easy extra still play hard impossible kill kill hard die easily heal wound hard pretty bad wounds skill problematic many useless zombie attack attack survivor chaotic zombie apocalypse zombie apocalypse popular issues problem many disrespect love boring involve better successful attack zombie attack fail appealing,Negative

"the godzilla jr i got from amazon came with the cardboard sleeve that was part of the web exclusive from japan.  that part is very cool.  the figure itself has very loose joints and his left hand keeps falling off. subsequent engineering of the monsterarts figures features thinner body parts and huge gaps in the shoulder, hips and stomach/waist joints.  while this allows for a bit more range of motion, the gaps are pretty ugly compared with the first godzilla release.  i would say that unless you are trying to collect every figure in the monsterarts series, this is not worth the purchase. for the money i'd rather get a 2012 ultraact.  those comes with tons of accessories and gimicks.  godzilla jr. came with 2 helicopters which really didn't look all that great.to clarify the size of this guy, a lot ot reviewers on youtube say he's about 3"", he's really more like 4"" tall and his tail is another 4"" long.  the size of a star wars/gi joe figure from 80s.",Negative, 0.3333333333333333,cool loose falling thinner huge pretty ugly worth like,Negative

"i feel the name of this ""toy"" is misleading and deceptive. the fisher-price laugh and learn apptivity storybook reader is nothing more than a cellphone case! a highly priced case at that. while it's cute and makes your very expensive iphone attractive to a baby, it does nothing on its own. any entertainment will come from your phone and not from this $20.00 box.""from the manufacturerpuppy's apptivity book provides baby with an interactive learning experience while protecting mom and dad's electronic device from dribbles and drool. the case, which looks just like baby's favorite book, is the perfect way for them to interact with classic stories and nursery rhymes. the durable case holds the device behind a clear film to protect the screen and mom has the option to block the home button or make it accessible. puppy's apptivity book interacts with the free laugh and learn applications. baby advances content by opening and closing the book's cover, which helps to promote early literacy skills. and, adorable animations and audio prompts will encourage baby to explore and unlock even more rich content. apple products not included. compatible with iphone 1g, 3g, 3gs, 4g, 4s and ipod touch 2g, 3g, and 4g.the above description refers to the fisher-price app you can unlock with purchase. i'm unsure of how they can make the bold claim that advancing content on your iphone will build literacy skills and the clear film will not protect any phone from the trouble a baby is capable of inflicting on very expensive electronics. again, the animations and audio prompts also come from the app and your phone, not this toy. keep in mind there is a safety lock to keep your 6 month old (age recommendation, lol)( and me, almost impossible to open) from removing your phone...which begs the question..how do you answer or use your phone while baby is using it? this is a major fail product!! please see my picture of actual back of phone, it is not as depicted in this product's description and it does not have a home button.i can not  recommend this product in good conscience.",Negative, 0.18181818181818185,misleading deceptive laugh learn cute expensive attractive learning experience like favorite perfect classic durable clear protect accessible free laugh learn content opening adorable encourage rich content compatible touch unsure content clear protect trouble capable expensive safety recommendation impossible open major fail please recommend good,Positive

"we own the original and played the star trek version at a friend's house. we found the star trek version to be very visually confusing. here are reasons why i recommend buying (or staying with) the original version of settlers of catan and not this game:1. the number circles show a radar type graphic with the numbers less likely to be rolled having a smaller radar area (sorry, i really can't explain it) that makes it much harder to tell the frequency when placing settlements/outposts at the beginning of the game. also the numbers are smaller if they are less likely to be rolled making it very difficult to find the 12 and 2 when gathering resources.2. the game pieces are all raised on little pedestal pieces. they are two separate parts, so you have to put them together before you can do anything with them (like a plastic champagne glass). i'd prefer simpler pieces. more importantly, they are tall and block the view of the board making it hard to see the numbers when gathering resources. also, they are plastic and look very delicate.3. the dice have really rounded corners, so it takes forever for them to fall when spinning on a corner.  for some reason the pips on the dice are different colors (one die has blue and the other has red). not important, just a little thing that i thought was silly and unnecessary.4. the &#34;food&#34; in the new game is yellow/gold and yet it does not correspond to &#34;wheat&#34; from the original game for building purposes. this really threw us off since we are so familiar with the original version.5. the development cards are too similar to the resource cards when looking at the backs. the backs should have been a different color and different graphic so that you can clearly see which cards are which.6. adding the star trek theme to the original game concept does not really enhance the game play at all. the only difference in game play is the addition of a set of cards that allow you to avoid or change certain elements of the game. for instance, one card allows you ignore the effects of a rolled 7, another allows you to move your star ship (road equivalent). my friends didn't even use these cards because they felt it was too complicated. if you already own the original, this one is not different enough to justify buying it.",Negative, 0.3,original confusing recommend original sorry difficult like prefer simpler hard fall reason die important silly new original original clearly original enhance play play addition allow change ignore complicated original enough,Negative

"last year i had the opportunity to review the original innotab, so i was eager to see if they had greatly improved things this year with the innotab 2s.  my kids always love playing with my ipad, so the idea of a little tablet with some kids games that i didn't have to monitor was quite appealing.  i was not pleased with the innotab overall, but i had high hopes for the innotab 2s.  the innotab 2s has many improvements over the innotab, but also has taken a big step backwards.the first thing i noticed is that the new innotab is smaller.  it still has a kick-stand on the back and a stylus sleeve, but there is now a hole in the stylus and a small attach point for a string to hold the stylus.  oddly enough, innotab doesn't give you the string, so you need to get one yourself.  there is also now a camera on the top that pivots for both self portraits and photos of other people and a microphone for recording sound.the innotab 2s is still a usb device controlled by software you install on your pc, but it now has wifi for downloading apps.  this permits your child to ""shop"" in the online store, put apps on a wish list, and then allows the parent to buy them later.  the act of your child shopping sends you an e-mail with their ""wishes"".  sadly, the wifi interface didn't work with my home network since i don't have ssid broadcast turned on.  even entering the name manually like i do on my ipad would not work, so i had to adjust my security settings down for the innotab to work.once i turned it on, i was also surprised because normally new hardware runs faster, but this one runs slower.  for the original innotab, it tooks 16 seconds to get to the login screen and a total of 42 seconds to get through both power-up and login.  the new innotab 2s takes 33 seconds to get to the login screen and 49 seconds to go from off to the home screen.  pathetic!  this is for a little kid who will get impatient and mash the power button wondering why it won't turn on.  why can't they implement a sleep mode or similar?  taking almost a minute to turn on just is not acceptable today.i was also hoping that there would be some improvement to the actual device games itself, but they are still fairly low resolution and slow.  most of them are not very educational, and repeat the same basic tasks over and over.  a few accelerometer based games are fun, as are the silly camera applications.  my kids had a great time playing with them, but there is a limit to what you can do with the device.  my kids tried one of the ebooks that came with the tablet (there is a free cartridge included), but navigation was hard because the interface was so slow.  this screen seems less sensitive to a finger than the original, so you really need the stylus.  many times my kids were not sure if they had clicked a button and it was ""thinking"", or if their click had not registered.  sometimes it took several taps with the stylus for anything to happen.  it was a frustrating experience compounded by the fact they still play with the innotab 1 and that one runs faster!let's talk cost of ownership.  the innotab 2s costs $100.  innotab rechargeable batteries plus ac adapter will set you back $30.  add another $20 for an sd card (not included).  you're up to $150 when you can get a kindle fire for $159.  each game cartridge is $25 and the downloadable apps range in price from $3-$7.  in other words, you can hit $200 really quickly.  but $200 will get you a kindle fire hd which comes with rechargeable batteries, more memory, far more free apps, and many apps that cost $1 (and turns on in a second).my conclusion?  i received this to evaluate, but i can't see myself wanting to even spend an additional $25 for a game cartridge when i know i can get better games on an inexpensive android tablet that will run faster and smoother (and for less money).  the only advantage of the innotab is durability, but other than that, i can't really recommend this device in today's world of inexpensive real tablets.  the low quality applications and limited capabilities might have warranted 3-4 stars if the device weren't so mind-numbingly slow.  every button you click requires a 10-15 second lag while it loads the next screen.  this hardware is well past its expiration date.  the durable plastic shell and form factor are great, but innotab needs to update their processor to make a kids tablet to compete in the modern world.",Negative, 0.19718309859154934,opportunity original eager improved love idea appealing pleased many improvements new still oddly enough give top still sadly work like work security surprised new faster slower original new pathetic impatient power sleep acceptable improvement still fairly slow fun silly great time limit free hard slow sensitive original many frustrating experience still play add free many better inexpensive faster smoother advantage recommend inexpensive real quality limited slow lag well durable great modern,Positive

"i cannot say that i am all that much into monster high and i probably would not admit it on the internet if i was.  so i left most of the testing of this product to my three daughters, 10, 7, and 6.when i took the car out of the box for my kids, my initial impressions were quite positive.  the level of detail on the vehicle was quite good for a plastic car.  there are various spooky details on various components.  the dash has a spider web inlay, the shifter and tail lights are gargoyles, and the steering wheel and wheel covers kind of has a medieval cross design.i gave it to my kids and by the end of the day, i had one of the girls come up to me and tell me that it broke already.  there is a seatbelt in the trunk/back seat area that holds the dolls in place.  that seatbelt broke completely off, so at this point the back seat is useless.the girls continued playing with it and at the end of the month, they gave me their list of pros and cons with the car.my girls loved the idea the car had a trunk where they could put the dolls' clothes and such.  they really liked the fact that the car could seat 4 dolls, assuming the seat belt did not break.  they also loved the detail of the car and really liked the shifter and the fact the car had cup holders.my girls were really disappointed in the fact the rear seatbelt broke.  they also showed me that when they put their dolls in the front seat, they sank way down in the car.  the seat belts in front were a bit tough to put on as well.my oldest daughter really liked the details in the car and she gave it 4 stars, deducting a star for the broken seatbelt.  my middle daughter was a bit less impressed by the details.  she also cited the broken seatbelt and gave it 3 stars.  my youngest daughter was much less forgiving about the fact the car broke.  she gave the car a 1 star rating.personally, i will give kudos to the details and the overall sturdiness of the car.  however, i can imagine a parent having to deal with a crying kid if they have the same thing happen to them as we did and having to deal with trying to return the toy and getting a replacement.  based on other reviews, i think our car breaking is an exception rather than the norm.  however, i cannot change the fact ours broke the first day.  the average rating of my kids would be 2.67 stars.  factoring in my opinion, i give the item 2 stars.",Negative, 0.4333333333333333,monster positive good spooky kind broke broke pros cons loved idea liked break loved liked disappointed broke tough liked broken impressed broken forgiving broke give kudos breaking change broke give,Negative

(this software is loaded onto your pc and is for interfacing with the leappad 2...downloading apps and so forth)after the upgrade, the software tries to ""tune up"" the device.  what it does is crash to leap pad 2 device; it locks up on the tune ups screen and the child cannot use the device at all.  multiple attempts and reboots do not fix the problem.  the company takes a while to get ck with emails and they are not that helpful.  given the money that the device costs and the extremely high cost of the simple apps, i'm very, very disappointed with this company and their products.original review:we bought this for our six year old boy and he really loves it so far.  it's hard to tell how durable this is going to be.  sound quality is decent.technical comments:video display... well it's not retina, let's put it that way.  it's about one tenth the resolution of an ipad, but decent enough for kids. and it's not a capacitative touch screen.  it's resistive.  they are cheaper than capacitative and don't work as work as well.  but again...adequate for kids.  it does function adequately, especially when used with the stylus.unlike the vtech product , this does not come with the capability of playing your own mp3 songs.  you have to buy their app ($5)...and it's extremely basic... cannot play or view by album or artist.  just a big jumble of songs alphabetically by song title.  not even icons or album art to help kids identify the music if they cannot read well.  simply put,  it sucks.my big gripe is that they preload this with relatively little software/ apps.  and to purchase them is incredibly expensive.  the cheapest app you'll find is $5...and there are just a few.  some are $10.  a lot are $25!!! for kids games?  the most sophisticated adult games on mobile devices are not even half that cost.  holy cow!  that's just ridiculous!  hard to feel good about this whole platform when it's obviously just preying off generous parents.  i would seriously consider getting an inexpensive android 7"" tablet and getting free or cheaper apps.  but its likely that most of those apps would not be quite as child friendly.  also we wanted to make sure there was no wifi on a six year old's device.  so...a compromise.  we'll let him buy apps with his allowance money if he wants.",Negative, 0.2051282051282051,connect upgrade crash problem helpful simple disappointed loves hard durable quality well decent enough touch cheaper work work well capability play help well gripe incredibly expensive cheapest sophisticated holy ridiculous hard good whole generous inexpensive free cheaper friendly well,Positive
"my nieces and nephews all got this device for christmas -- ostensibly for educational purposes but (by my observation) also as a means by which to pry them from their parents' ipads. the leappad2 has been a major disappointment for all of them. many of the thoughtful reviews here detail the flaws (and joys) of the leappad2. my complaints in brief follow:- for kids used to an ipad the leappad2 is clumsy and limited. it lacks the fluidity and intuitiveness of a grown-up tablet.- all of the leappad books and games are expensive, costing in the $20-$25 range.- there's nothing special or exclusive about the leappad games/books either. for example, a leappad  minnie mouse game costing $20 is available on ipad for a couple of bucks.-yes you can now download apps through a real computer but since the leappad2's memory is extremely limited you're mostly stuck buying -- and lugging -- cartridges.  in 2013 this seems primitive.- there are few leappad games or books for kids under 4. unfortunately the littlest kids are the only ones with any tolerance for this limited device. by the time a child is 6 (at least in my family)  a leappad is considered a ""baby toy."" if you think your investment in leappad is worthwhile because it's long-term you may be in for a sorry surprise.- unless you buy the $50 recharger  you'll be putting in new aa batteries every other day.- the screen is too small and low resolution to make art apps the glorious fun they are on an ipad.  kids are sorely disappointed.in conclusion, the leappad may have been an ingenious invention back when we were all using pcs and laptops. now that the tablet era has arrived it's simply sad. don't buy it. save up for an ipad or give your kids the less expensive larger-screen kindle fire. either are real investments in your kids. a leappad is just money set on fire.",Negative, 0.48571428571428577,pry major disappointment many thoughtful flaws complaints clumsy limited lacks intuitiveness expensive special available real limited stuck primitive unfortunately tolerance limited time family worthwhile sorry new glorious fun sorely ingenious sad save give expensive real,Negative
"within a couple days of giving this to my kid as a gift it turned out to be defective.  there were lines of triangles across the screen.  i bought the gift ahead of time from amazon, so i was past 30 days when the problem showed up.no problem, under warranty with leapfrog, right? right?yeah.  dealing with them eventually got so incredibly miserable i gave up.  it would take about a week for them to reply to any inquiry.  additionally, i had installed the leapfrog leappad2 recharger pack in the leappad2 before the leappad2 went all wonky, and guess what?  the recharger pack is not removable.  i never did get leapfrog to answer what to do about the recharger pack.  in order to get a replacement leappad, i was supposed to &#34;deface&#34; the defective one with a marker across the screen with a code number (rma?) that they, guess what, forgot to include in the email instructions.yes, i really got an email with instructions that looked like, &#34;write this number (type in number) across the screen with a marker.&#34;and never got an answer about the batteries.and never got a replacement leappad2 either.just based on my experience with the customer service, i will never buy another leap frog item again, no matter what toy they sell.  by the time all was said and done, i should have just bought my kid an ipod touch or ipad mini, and a durable case, and put apps on there.imho, leap frog is the biggest rip-off ever, and will never see another penny from me.",Negative, 0.3157894736842105,giving gift defective gift time problem problem right incredibly miserable order defective like experience service time touch durable ripoff,Negative

"hasbro has a great idea on expanding their lazer tag product line with this product. this is a great first revision as the hardware is durable and feels great. my only gripe is with the app that is lacking in advanced functionality. the good news is if they take the time and spend a little more development time with the app they can take this product to the next level.the current lazer tag app does perform the basic functions you would expect; explosions overlaid on the camera live view, switch of different gun modes, a story mode to play against robots from outer space. what is missing is lazer tag is the stats and more ridged rules to ensure no cheating. lets face it as the little kids that will be playing this will try and cheat any way they can and that will lead to fights, of the fist kind ;)here is how to take this gun to the next level. simply create kids single player type apps such as; duck hunt, skeet shooter, or even better yet a classic carnival shooting gallery type game.

"this product arrived just before my kids (ages three and five, both girls) were to set off for a week at their grandparents, so they took it along with them. let's just say grandma and grandpa weren't sorry to see grover go home, although they said the kids didn't play with him much after the first few days anyway. when i took a look at him to write this review, my older daughter asked me, ""mommy, can you please shut that thing off?""even with several moving parts, grover does appear to be quite sturdy. his head swivels side to side, his arms flap around, his visor raises and lowers over his eys and his cape flaps in the breeze. he does not, of course, actually fly, at least not without human help.but he does talk. a lot. i played around with him for about 15 minutes and didn't get a repeated phrase, so he has quite a repertoire. my parents said they didn't hear any repeats either, except for the obligatory ""hello everybodeeeee!"" when he's first activated. his voice sounds just like you'd expect grover's voice to sound (which is to say, every bit as annoying). unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, depending on your perspective), the demonstration batteries that come with the toy don't last too long.i will readily admit that my kids are not really the target audience for this toy. i think even my three-year-old is too old for it, and it probably appeals to boys more than girls. this could probably be a decent gift for an active toddler through early preschool boy. someone else's little boy, that is. it's a toss up whether this toy is more or less annoying than tickle me elmo, but the target audience is pretty much the same.update: i just noticed that it says ""warning, small parts, not for children under 3"". i don't know how much that's just an obligatory warning on anything not specifically designed for babies, but i didn't see anything obvious that could break off and be hazardous to children. if anything, the hard plastic is more of a threat for bumps and bruises, especially if grover gets swung or thrown around and hits someone. as already noted, i don't think this product will appeal to kids over three, so if you are concerned about this warning for your toddler/two year old, then i don't recommend buying it at all. personally, while there are plenty of reasons why i wouldn't be likely to buy this product, safety is not one of them.",Negative, 0.4375,sorry play please moving sturdy breeze human hello like annoying unfortunately fortunately readily decent gift active annoying tickle pretty warning warning break hazardous hard threat bumps bruises appeal concerned warning recommend safety,Negative
"i bought this about 8 months ago on clearance for about $11 at a local retail chain.  at first, my then 20 month old son loved feeding elmo and getting cookie monster to say his phrases.  it is super flimsy as other reviewers have said.  the oven door falls off constantly as does one of the legs.  the feeding part jams easily if you aren't careful.  my son rarely plays with it now and it will be finding a new home soon.  there are better ones out there that i've seen.",Negative, 0.375,loved monster super flimsy falls easily new better,Negative
"we gave this toy to my 2-year-old granddaughter, even though we felt it might not engage her.  we were wrong.  because it was new and colorful, she was immediately interested.  she liked and recognized the stylized lion, but didn't know how the toy worked, so we demonstrated.she loaded the balls, pulled the tail, and initially liked watching the balls being propelled across the room.  we retrieved them for her, and she repeated the process a few times -- maybe five -- but then went on to other toys.  this is what i expected.  though she didn't say it, she was likely thinking ""is that all there is to this?""all kids outgrow toys.  that's inevitable, but it would be nice to know that when you buy one, the child will enjoy it for a reasonable period of time.  from the experience with my granddaughter, i'd say that the toy is best suited for a one-year old.  at the age of two, kids tend to look for more complex toys.  this one is cute, but doesn't offer enough of a challenge.",Negative, 0.15000000000000002,engage wrong new colorful interested liked stylized worked liked inevitable nice enjoy reasonable time experience best complex cute enough challenge,Positive
"i have two good things to say about this toy: 1. it speaks more than just english and spanish, it also speaks in french and mandarin.  i have never seen another toy that speaks in more than english and spanish. 2. my daughter loves the little bit of music the toy makes.yep, not much else good to say.  this toy is pretty lame.  the balls don't pop out like they are supposed to.  they might if you jam down on the tail really hard and have all the balls in the lion, but otherwise, not so much.  the counting resets itself fairly quickly, meaning if you aren't feeding balls to the lion on a quick and continual basis, it starts over at 1.  not so helpful in learning to count.  i guess they have to start back and 1 if it isn't played with for awhile, but the reset to 1 is a very short pause, especially if your kid is crawling around collecting the balls that flew out of the lions stomach.  the noise the lion makes when ""eating"" the ball, a gulping noise, makes it sound like it is part of the words it is saying.  the enunciation of words isn't good, when it says ""francais"" it doesn't sound like it is saying that at all.  it is also way too easy to cycle through the 4 different languages, what a great way to confuse your child.  there should be switches to toggle the languages, not just an easily pushed, and enticing, star button on the front.  the music it plays when you push down the tail is fun music, but it is all of 5 seconds long. having to push down on the tail over and over again to get the balls to pop out gets old quickly and my daughter loses interest.  for a toy that specifically is being marketed as a ball popping toy, this seriously fails, and the counting aspect of the toy isn't any better.",Negative, 0.28571428571428564,good loves good pretty lame like jam hard fairly meaning helpful learning start noise noise like good like easy great confuse easily enticing fun loses interest fails better,Negative
"i had my just turned 2 yr old nephew over and all he wanted to do was play with the balls. he had no interest in the lion what so ever. while i think it's great that it speaks other languages, are you really going to carry on the teachings? i think it should have focused on something else besides languages. i will say that the balls have held up pretty well for a 2 yr old throwing them around every where.",Negative, 0,play interest great pretty well,Positive
"i was with what i thought were the perfect subjects to test the lion toy - my 10 month old twin grandsons.  they have different personalities, so i thought even if one didn't like it, the other might.  neither was impressed.  they were both interested in the 3 balls that come with it, but had little to no interest in the lion.  they were not impressed that it could count to 10 in several languages.  it didn't even interest their 5 year old brother. there was a glimmer of interest when someone else made the balls pop out and then placed them in the lion's mouth.  that interest didn't last long.one problem, i noticed, is that they can tip it over on it's back very easily, yet can't stand it up again without assistance.  on it's back, you can't do anything.  one did put his hand in the lion's mouth to try to retrieve a ball, but began crying when the mouth closed and he couldn't pull his hand out.  it is a cute, brightly colored toy, so i was disappointed that it didn't do more to interest the intended age group (9mo+).i like to comment on packaging.  this was not frustration free packaging.  it was hard to get to the heavy cords (find all of the clear tape around the edges to make it easier), which were too heavy for my scissors to cut through, and were wrapped multiple times around pieces of cardboard.  the front was also open which makes wrapping a challenge.",Negative, 0.17391304347826086,perfect like impressed interested interest impressed interest glimmer interest interest problem easily cute disappointed interest like frustration free hard clear easier open challenge,Positive

"first of all, this toy is quite a pain to unpack, a complete opposite example of frustration-free packaging. there're 15 or more tightly tied strings to untangle, and a couple of them required the use of scissors. there's also a lot of packing tape, which together with the plastic tie plates is quite environmentally unfriendly! also, the yellow arrow label you see must be peeled off for spidey to do his climbing, and it's quite a chore to peel off in a clean fashion. the climbing mechanism works poorly, and i don't see how a 3-6-year-old can pump the winding mechanism by him- or herself. the entire set shows rather poor designs, and the electronic functions are just a joke (annoying lights and sounds). unless your 3-6-year-old is a spidey fanatic, this is not a toy to get.",Negative, 0.8181818181818183,pain unfriendly peeled chore clean works poorly poor joke annoying fanatic,Negative
"my 8 year old son used his birthday money to buy this.  he was so excited after seeing the commercials on tv.  after setting it up, and using the wall climbing action 3 times, the mechanism that moves spiderman up the wall stopped moving.  it makes all the sounds like it is moving, but i think it is stuck inside.  i tried changing the batteries and taking the bottom off but was still unable to get in to where the mechanism is located.  so, a huge disappointment for spiderman's best buddy.  still, after throwing a fit and calling this toy a complete rip off, my son was able to calm down and get back to playing with the set.  the lizard pops out of a window and knocks spidey off the ledge and it makes all kinds of sounds with lights and stuff, so he is enjoying that part of the set.",Negative, 0.23529411764705882,excited action moving like moving stuck still unable huge disappointment best still fit rip able calm enjoying,Negative
